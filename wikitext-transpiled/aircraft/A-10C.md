=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The A-10C provides the pilot with a 38 mm thick armoured tub. The front of the canopy also provides the pilot with bulletproof glass with a thickness of 44 mm.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:''' 

* AIM-9Ms are very potent against its range of targets
* {{Annotation|HMD|Head Mounted Display}} allows for off boring the missiles
** Very advanced HMD shows IFF (in cockpit view) of both friendly ground and air units.
* {{Annotation|MAWS|Missile Approach Warning System}} (Automatic release of countermeasures)
* Large array of CAS ordinance
* Large pool of countermeasures 
* Decent turn rate

'''Cons:'''

* Very slow for a jet
** Subsonic, and can get outsped by propeller-driven planes
** Even slower when mounting further ordinance 
* Large target
