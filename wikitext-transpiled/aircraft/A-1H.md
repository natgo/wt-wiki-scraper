== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season IX, "Smell of Victory"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The A-1H only has 2 15 mm steel plates on the side and 40 mm of bulletproof glass. The side armour can easily be penetrated with 20 mm rounds.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The A-1H can perform well in battles at its BR, either in a CAS role with 30 x 250 lb bomb capacity, 228 x FFAR rockets and 11 x Mk 77 mod 2 incendiary bombs. Once the ordnance is expended, it can also perform decently as a fighter since it has flares, which allows for it to be used in higher tier battles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Huge and varied payload options, including napalms and rockets
* Access to custom loadout options
* Can mount up to 8 miniguns with plenty of ammunition, capable of destroying any planes with a short burst
* Access to countermeasures, making it an ideal CAS in ground battles
* Four 20 mm cannons are good for ground targets and plane
* Sturdy and armoured enough to tank on machine gun and cannon rounds

'''Cons:'''

* Mediocre manoeuvrability that worsens with a payload you carry
* 20 mm cannons and miniguns have different ballistic properties, can make lining up shot somewhat tricky
* Can face jet aircraft that can easily hunt down and destroy the plane
* Mighty Mouse Rockets are ineffective, requiring a direct hit even against SPAA

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
