== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The A-20G-30 is rather well-protected. It sports 3 defensive .50 calibre guns, two in a dorsal turret capable of complete rotation, the other in a limited arc under the aircraft's tail. As for the armour, the pilot is protected by 57 mm bulletproof glass and several 12.7 mm steel plates in front of and behind, and 8 mm plates to his sides. The only thing to look out for is the chance of the tail section ripping off at a higher rate than its other bomber and ground attacking comrades.

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, dorsal turret (400 rpg = 800 total)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, ventral turret (400 rpg)

The tail section of the plane creates a big blind spot for the dorsal turret. Be careful when enemies approach from behind because you will not be able to hit targets directly behind you.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The A-20G-30 was a modification of the American [[A-20G-25]], thus it excels at attacking soft targets such as howitzers and SPAA. The 6 x .50 calibre guns situated in the nose are fully capable of destroying light pillboxes en masse. While still capable of hitting bases with its 2 x 1,000 kg bombs, this aircraft is more effective with loads that contain larger numbers of bombs for soft targets.

With the 6 forward-facing .50 calibre guns and a decent turn time and rate of climb for a twin-engine aircraft, the A-20G-30 is well suited for the role of heavy fighter. Be warned, the A-20G-30 does not have the energy retention of dedicated heavy fighters like the [[Bf 110 (Family)|Bf 110]]'s in the German tech tree. This could lead to the aircraft being destroyed in such a dogfight.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great bomb load for an aircraft of this type
* Effective offensive armament
* High survivability

'''Cons:'''

* Lacklustre turn time
* Weak tail section
* Poor energy retention
