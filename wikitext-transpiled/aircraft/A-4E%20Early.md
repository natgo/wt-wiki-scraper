== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a squadron rank {{Specs|rank}} American strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "New Power"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The A-4E behaves like the A-4B, with excellent manoeuvrability at speed, aided by the automatic wing slats. However, the aircraft's poor energy retention during turns is profound, and airspeed will drop down to about 320 km/h (200 mph) after more than a 90 degree turn. Overall, it can turn with [[G.91 (Family)|G.91s]] and [[MiG-15|MiG-15s]] without issue, however extended dogfights should be avoided. If uptiered, flight performance leaves much to be desired, it can be outmanoeuvred even by the [[Yak-38 (Family)|Yak-38]],  [[F-104 (Family)|F-104]] or [[MiG-21S (R-13-300)|MiG-21]] in a dogfight.

These wings are well-known to be fragile and to easily snap at relatively normal speeds. To prevent this, always pitch positive relative to the wing. Pitching negative, or yawing too violently, are easy ways to tear one or both of your wingtips. Use the plane's high roll rate to your advantage, and make it a habit to preemptively bank into your turns. Also avoid speeding up too fast in a dive, which can also tear off wings at high speeds, instead open up airbrakes or lower throttle to 50% before diving.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 2.54 mm steel surrounding bottom half of the pilot
* 50 mm bulletproof glass in front of the cockpit

The front half of the plane holds the pilot and a self-sealing fuel tank. The wings hold non self-sealing fuel tanks, and the back half of the plane holds the engine.

One single well-placed round from an [[ADEN (30 mm)|ADEN]] cannon can completely cripple the plane by taking out the pilot or the engine. It is completely open to attack from the side and front although it can be armed with flares and chaff. Overall, survivability is quite poor, and players should minimize their chance of being hit by constantly looking around and by staying high or fast.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In Air Realistic battles, one can use this plane in a wide array of roles due to the wide array of armament.

One role the A-4E can serve is as an air-to-air fighter. The A-4E can equip either the 2 x [[AIM-9B Sidewinder]]s, the 2 x [[AIM-9B Sidewinder|AIM-9Bs]] and the 20 mm gunpod, or triple gunpods for this role. The A-4E's standard 20 mm cannons can easily shred any plane in the sky with a handful of well-placed rounds, however it only comes with 200 bullets, so short controlled bursts must be used, and only should be fired sparingly. The missiles can easily supplement the cannon, however these early missiles have a narrow tracking cone, and can easily miss targets that fly erratically, so they too must be used sparingly. If one prefers to be a gun fighter, a single gunpod (or three) can be attached to spray down targets, however they drag down the plane's climb and turn performance (especially the triple gunpods, which eliminate this plane's climbing ability in a fight).

General tactics with the A-4E is to keep altitude until one finds a target to pounce on, preferably fighters trying to climb, low flying aircraft, or distracted aircraft. Always attempt to fight aircraft flying alone; attacking an aircraft within a group is risky, as your low energy retention will make it hard to escape if the attack goes unfavourably. It is also best to turn off if your target starts to evade; If you try to chase, you can quickly bleed energy. However, when uptiered, especially versus planes like the British [[Harrier GR.1]], fighting offensively may not work at all, as these planes can easily outclimb and outrun you, and they will bounce you. In cases like these, it is best to stay back and play as a supporting fighter to your team, or simply switch to ground attack roles.

Your best defense is to not engage in fights where you are clearly outnumbered. However, if you are chased, there are little options for evasive manoeuvring. The plane's high roll rate will make it incredibly easy to dodge bullets, and the flares will help the plane dodge missiles. However, the low energy retention will make it extremely hard to escape the fight altogether, especially if perused by multiple aircraft. In such situations, your best bet is to have a friendly plane to pounce the chasing enemy fighters, which can give you a window to escape or fight back or to hide behind any hills or terrain that might cover you lower towards the ground.

If using this plane as a ground attacker, equip either [[FFAR Mighty Mouse|FFAR]] or [[Zuni Mk32 Mod 0 ATAP|Zuni]] rocket pods, [[AGM-12B Bullpup|AGM-12]] Bullpups, or the 20 mm gunpod, and attack ground targets. 

Another option is to use the wide array of bombs, preferably the 14 x 500 lb loadout, and destroy enemy bases (typically you can only destroy one, sometimes two) with them. Do this by flying low and fast, to the base hitting one or two and then turn around away from the enemy fighters. When flying back to the base, if the jet has [[AIM-9B Sidewinder|AIM-9's]]  equipped, try to support the team by hitting or scarring off enemy fighters who may be attacking a helpless ally. Then, when you return to base, you could rearm with bombs, or rearm with [[AIM-9B Sidewinder|AIM-9's]] and fly as a late-game fighter to finish off remaining players.

In Ground RB, the preferable secondary armaments are the [[FFAR Mighty Mouse|FFAR]] or [[Zuni Mk32 Mod 0 ATAP|Zuni]] rocket pods, or the 5 x [[AGM-12B Bullpup|AGM-12B]] missiles. These missiles, with enough practice, function like a precision 250 lb bomb that is guided to the target, most of the time destroying it. The 2 x AGM-62A Walleye bombs can also be used very effectively with practice, however with only two bombs, it is better to use the five [[AGM-12B Bullpup|AGM-12B]] missiles instead. When using the Walleyes, climb high and dive down onto enemy tanks to get a lock onto them, which takes away most cover they might be using. As well as strike Roll, the A-4E can use it's gun pods or it's AIM-9s to take down other strike Aircraft or Helicopters. The A-4E can be well paired with the [[XM-803]], [[MBT-70]], or the [[XM-1 (GM)|XM-1]] to form a good lineup.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to countermeasures
* Excellent roll rate
* Can utilize [[Ballistic Computer#CCRP Usage|CCRP]] to assist in bomb dropping
* Excellent ordnance options
** Has strong air-to-air support capability with access to [[AIM-9B Sidewinder]] missiles, powerful quick-firing 20 mm Mk11 Mod 5 gun pods, or a combination of both
** Can carry three gun pods at once for a devastating one-second burst mass
** Has powerful ground-attack capability, sporting a variety of unguided bombs and rockets, as well as guided AGM-12B Bullpup guided missiles and AGM-62A Walleye guided bombs
** Can Obliterate bases in Air RB with 250kg bombs and Napalm Mk77s
* Decent acceleration
* Radar Warning Receiver useful in uptiers

'''Cons:'''

* 2 x 20 mm cannons have low ammo (only 100 rounds each) and aren't particularly powerful
** Inaccurate when stock; since they are your only weapon when stock, this makes for a painful stock grind
* High speed manoeuvres can cause wings to rip
* Fragile
* Atrocious energy retention
* Mediocre top speed 
* Mediocre climb rate 
* Carrying any kind of ordnance diminishes the plane's flight performance significantly

The A4D-5 Skyhawk was an improved model of the A4D-2N (designated A-4C in 1962). The main improvement came in the form of the more powerful Pratt & Whitney J52-P-6A engine, producing 8,400 pounds of thrust. In addition to the new powerplant, the A4D-5 also received two more wing-mounted stores pylons, for a total of five. The avionics were also improved, including a new TACAN system and a toss-bombing computer. Later in their service life, many A-4E Skyhawks were upgraded with the fuselage avionics pod J52-P-8 engine (with 9,300 pounds of thrust) from the A-4F.

The A4D-5 first flew in July 1961, and was renamed to A-4E in 1962 after the Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System came into effect. The A-4E entered production in December of 1962; a total of 499 A-4E Skyhawks would be delivered to the US Navy and Marine Corps starting in January 1963.

The A-4E began to see combat in Vietnam after arriving in early 1965, but it did not fully replace the earlier Skyhawks such as the A-4C. After opening in June 1965, the Chu Lai Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) housed Marine A-4E Skyhawks. The Skyhawks landed using arrestor wires and took off by rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO). Throughout the Vietnam War, A-4 Skyhawks were used to provide close air support (CAS) for Marine Corps ground forces, primarily using bombs and rockets. A total of 362 A-4s of all types were lost during the Vietnam War, including non combat losses. 271 were from the US Navy, and 91 were from the Marine Corps.

During the war, many A-4Es and A-4Fs were used in the United States for training purposes. They had their armament - including external stores - removed and their slats fixed, and were used as aggressors (where they would act as enemy aircraft for training). In the aggressor role, an A-4 was called 'Mongoose'.

;1965 Philippine Sea Incident

It was December 5, 1965. This was the time of the Cold War and Vietnam War. Sailing 70 miles from the nearest island, 200 miles from Okinawa, was the USS ''Ticonderoga'', carrying Attack Squadron 56 (VA-56) consisting of A-4E attack jets that were carrying nuclear bombs. Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Douglas M. Webster, pilot of Douglas A-4E BuNo 151022 was performing a training exercise in his jet, rolling from hangar 2 to elevator 2. The jet was carrying a one megaton B43 thermonuclear bomb. An unspecified accident occurred, and the jet rolled off the deck. After a search, neither the pilot, the jet, nor the bomb was ever found, they likely sank the 16,000 ft (4,900 m) to the ocean floor. This was just one of the many "broken arrow" incidents during the Cold War.

The incident was acknowledged in 1981, but was misleading and it was fully revealed in 1989 due to a diplomatic inquiry by Japan. Lt. Cmdr. James Culda said on May 8, 1989 that "the environmental impact is expected to be nil", as the bomb was not armed and poses no threat at 4,900 m under the sea.

=== [[wt:en/news/6963-development-a-4e-skyhawk-heinemann-s-hot-rod-grows-up-en|Devblog]] ===
The beginning of the jet era and the escalation of the Cold War forced the US naval aviation command to look for a replacement for the very successful carrier-based piston-engine AD Skyraider, with the possibility of delivering a tactical nuclear weapon in the area of operation of an aircraft carrier group. With the beginning of the military campaign in Korea, the Douglas Aircraft Company began developing a carrier-based attack aircraft with an unconventional approach - instead of pursuing engine power, usually bringing weight and large size to the aircraft, Ed Heinemann's team concentrated on finding ways to lighten the construction, keeping it under 12,000 lbs.

The projected aircraft was a fairly compact, lightweight jet fighter-attacker with a delta-shaped wing and a competently lightweight design. This is how the A-4A "Skyhawk" was born, one of the first jet-based carrier-based aircraft capable of carrying a nuclear bomb. The aircraft was distinguished by its simplicity of design, practical controls with excellent flight characteristics for its time. Soon, in 1956, the A-4B version appeared, capable of carrying a huge variety of mounted weapons on three suspension points, including guided missiles.

Thus, the Skyhawk had become a truly universal carrier-based aircraft, capable of solving the entire spectrum of tasks for US Naval Aviation. A rather noticeable drawback of the attack aircraft was still the limited range of action, also army types always wanted to increase the weapon load. In 1961, Douglas presented an improved version of the aircraft with five pylons for armament and a new engine, which compensated for a heavier combat load, and also increased the range of the attack aircraft. It was the A-4E that became one of the most massive Skyhawk modifications and formed the image of a modern carrier-based attack aircraft. The "E" version was actively involved in the Vietnam War, and later, up till the end of the 80's, was used to simulate enemy aircraft in training dogfights.
