== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The A-4H is a versatile aircraft which fits into a wide range of playstyles. Varying from close air support (CAS) to base bomber or even as an air superiority fighter. Players who yield such a tool as the A-4H Skyhawk have a lot of options when it comes to playstyle choices.

'''Ground Realistic Battles (RB)'''

For those interested in its CAS abilities, it comes with a wide range of ordnance and a radar warning receiver (RWR). The best way to utilise the plane in this role is to use the ordnance to aid allied ground units in tight situations and clear a path for them to reach their respective objectives. RWR will help you by making you aware of any enemy or allied anti-air systems that choose to make you their prey.

'''Air Battles (AB/RB/SB)'''

For those interested in Air Battles, there are multiple ways you can make yourself an asset to the team. You can use your very respectable bomb and rocket payloads to help allies destroy enemy bases and ground units to bleed tickets.

The A-4H can also go in light as an air superiority fighter. The plane has a good rate of climb and roll rate, meaning you can employ hit and run tactics on your opponents, or go all-in and get personal with the enemy aircraft. The A-4's biggest opponents are the MiG-15/17 and G.91 R series. The A-4H is a very capable plane in the right hands but is hard to fly, especially against a proven aircraft such as the MiG-17. The poor energy retention can put you at a huge disadvantage against such opponents if you are not careful in managing your air speed. This means that you should only engage in tight and personal fights when you are sure you can finish them quickly and escape. For those who are newer, staying close to teammates and helping each other is generally a very effective tactic in the A-4H and generally yields the best chance for survival and success in the Skyhawk. For those more daring, flying solo is very possible but requires and higher level of awareness and tactical knowledge, the unforgiving nature of the plane depends on it.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent acceleration and climb rate
* Good roll rate
* Good instantaneous turn rate
* Good variety of ground attack ordnance
* Twin 30 mm DEFA cannons will take down any enemy aircraft
* Can carry 3 x additional 20 mm Mk 11 cannons
* You can't deploy landing flaps if your flight speed is too high, avoiding accidental destruction

'''Cons:'''

* Wings rip easily in tight high speed manoeuvres
* Low ammo on main guns
* Poor energy retention
* Wing slats extend only at very low speeds
* No air-to-air missiles (AAMs)
* Only one fuel tank is self-sealing (the one in the fuselage)
* Carrying heavy payload significantly reduces flight performance


== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In the early 1960s, Israel was keen to purchase Skyhawks from the U.S. either from surplus inventory or new planes being built for sale specifically to Israel. At first, the U.S. rejected Israel's request for A-4s in an effort to remain neutral to the Arab world. However, a few years later, the U.S. changed its mind and allowed Israel to purchase Skyhawks. Israel sent out an order of 48 A-4H Skyhawks. The A-4H was an A-4E but with a better engine (J52-P-8A), modified vertical stabilizer with an IFF (AN/APX-46), a drag chute, and didn't have the "humpback" which housed avionics. The A-4Hs arrived in Israel in late 1967 and the Israelis replaced the 20-millimeter cannons with DEFA 30-millimeter cannons.

A-4Hs saw action very quickly after procurement in Jordan during the War of Attrition. Israel later increased the order to 90 A-4Hs. During the Yom Kippur War, Israel suffered heavy losses of their A-4Hs and acquired more A-4Es from the US Navy and Marines. In an effort to reduce losses, Israel extended the exhaust tailpipe to reduce losses from heat-seeking missiles by moving the detonation further away from the aircraft. Some A-4Hs also had their J52-P-8A engines replaced with the J-52-P-408N (same engine in the A-4N), which is an increase of over 750 kgf of thrust.
