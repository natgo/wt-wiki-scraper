== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a subsonic (originally naval) strike aircraft, produced by Vought Aeronautics Division of LTV Aerospace Corporation. The A-7K was a dual seat variant of the [[A-7D]] built for the USAF; the A-7K specifically for the Air National Guard by lengthening the nose of the aircraft. The A-7K was mostly used for training, with 30 built to supplement the A-7Ds already in service. In the 1980s, several aircraft were equipped with a thermal sight, and this is the variant represented in-game.

The A-7K was introduced during [[Update "Sky Guardians"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8186-event-repair-factory-en|"Repair Factory" event]], and has a large advantage over the tech tree [[A-7D]], as like the [[A-7E]] it gains access to a thermal sight, which makes spotting targets from a distance much more manageable. It has the same anti-tank armament as the A-7D, with access to the [[AGM-65B|Maverick B]] and the [[GBU-8 (2,000 lb)|GBU-8 "Hobo"]]; this means the aircraft is still incapable of using guided munitions at night despite having access to a thermal sight. The anti-air capability is much improved compared to both the D and E variants of the airframe, with the AIM-9L serving as the top air-to-air missile, although at the battle rating the A-7 is placed at these serve purely for self defense.

{{Navigation-End}}

The A-7K can carry huge amount of suspended armament for ground attack use. Aircraft starts of with up to 24 x 250 lb LDGP Mk 81 bombs, which are enough to dispose of a base in Air RB. After researching 24 x 500 lb Mk 82 bombs the plane is capable of destroying 2 bases in one run. It can also take 14 x 750 lb M117, 12 x 1,000 lb LDGP Mk 83 and 6 x 2,000 lb LDGP Mk 84 bombs, which are more useful in Ground RB since they offer larger blast radii. For use against ground vehicles the plane can carry 114 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets, 4 x 2,000 lb GBU-8 TV-guided bombs and 6 x AGM-65B TV-guided air-to-ground missiles. Guided munitions are used with the LANA Flir Navigation Pod, which provides thermal vision over the battlefield, making spotting targets easier. That makes the A-7K a very potent CAS option that can bring havoc upon the enemy team. The aircraft can also carry 6 x BLU-27/B incendiary bombs, and for self-defense against enemy planes it starts with 2 x AIM-9J air-to-air missiles, which can be upgraded to AIM-9Ls. For increased firepower, the plane can take 2 x 20 mm  GAU-4 gunpods (with 1,200 rounds each) or 2 x 30 mm GAU-13/A gunpods (with 353 rounds each).

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Air Realistic Battles

In Air RB, the A-7K presents a very limited utility, mainly attacking ground targets. Bases are an option, but its low top speed combined with the limited manoeuvrability while carrying ordnance make it a perilous mission, as you are an easy target for any fighter that can show up, and friendly planes will almost always get there before you do. Flying to the side low to the ground is recommended, until enemy aircraft will back out or start fighting with your team. Then you can target respawning bases behind the frontline, and once you are done, if you didn't get a chance to do so, you can try to use your missiles to take down enemies, but keep in mind you don't want to start actively fighting. If a fighter decides to target you, strongly consider dropping your ordnance and abandoning any bombing run to increase your chances of survival. The strongest enemies you can encounter are the MiG-29, F-16 and F-14. There is nothing the A-7K can realistically do to counter those aircraft, so you want to stay unseen as long as it is possible, though the AIM-9L can occasionally get rid of an unsuspecting target.

;Ground Realistic Battles

As a strike aircraft, the A-7K is exceptionally well equipped for CAS missions. Guided ordnance with LANA Flir navigation pod make a very potent combo, allowing you to keep distance from SPAAGs, though SAM SPAAs are still a huge threat, especially the Pantsir-S1, as you spawn within its range. The best thing you can do is fly close to the ground, go to the side of the map and only reveal yourself when you are close to the battlefield. Then, you want to quickly spot SPAAs and target them with your AGMs or guided bombs using the navigation pod. You can also go and check if there are any helicopters up and destroy them so your team can focus more on objectives.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Airframe is relatively sturdy
* Carries enough ordnance to destroy 2 bases
* Guided munitions make it very effective for CAS
* Gets LANA Flir navigation pod for spotting ground targets
* The internal 20 mm M61A1 rotary cannon can shred enemy aircraft
* AIM-9Ls can be pretty effective for air-to-air combat

'''Cons:'''

* Poor flight performance
* Easy target for enemy aircraft
* Lacks a functional radar
* Prone to catch fire when hit

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

As the United States Air Force was pulling out of South Asia in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War, the A-7Ds operating there were returned to the United States. The U.S Department of Defence pushed for these Corsair IIs to be transferred to the U.S Air National Guard, as these aircraft were starting to become obsolete in frontline service, and the {{Annotation|LTF|Lightweight Tactical Fighter}}-program was almost finished, which would give the Air Force the [[F-16A|General Dynamics F-16A Falcon]] to replace the A-7D in the frontline attack role. The U.S. Air National Guard, unlike the USAF, would ultimately decide that with the transfer of the A-7Ds, they would require a special two-seat training variant to ensure maximum combat training effectiveness on these "new" aircraft.

This special twin-seat training variant designated the A-7K, retained all the features of the base A-7D along with being fully combat capable. The A-7K, and the U.S ANG A-7Ds, would serve for many years more after their "retirement" from the USAF, undergoing a few mid-life upgrades, most famously the {{Annotation|LANA|Low Altitude Night Attack}}-program, which provided the A-7K and A-7D with a new thermal targeting and navigation pod<ref>'''[https://www.vought.org/special/html/sldbrev_3.html A-7D/K LANA Program Overview Status, 9 MAY 1985]'''</ref>.
