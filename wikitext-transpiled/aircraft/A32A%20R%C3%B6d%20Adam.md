== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The aircraft is powered by a Svenska Flygmotor RM5A turbojet engine, a licensed version of the British Rolls-Royce Avon Mk 21A TRD. The engine develops 3,420 kgf in normal operation and 4,630 kgf on afterburner, a very mediocre performance for such a large attack aircraft. With a full bomb load the airplane barely breaks away from the runway surface and cannot accelerate above 780 km/h. Even after jettisoning the suspended armament, the maximum speed increases to only 1050 km/h. In addition, at high altitudes, engine efficiency is significantly reduced, so do not try to climb above three kilometres - most of the opponents will be much higher anyway. It is better to gain maximum speed near the ground and then spend it as sparingly as possible, and in no case try to run away from the opponents at altitude. Needless to say, almost any potential opponent will be much faster than the Swedish Striker.

The aircraft's arrow-shaped wing has a large area and advanced mechanization, which means low stall speed and good stability at low speeds. Also a large area of ailerons as if disposes to active maneuvering, but let down the stabilizer - it loses its effectiveness at speeds above 600 km / h and does not allow you to conduct active maneuvering. But, thanks to limited rudder thrust and competent centering, the aircraft almost never reaches critical angles of attack, as, for example, [[MiG-21F-13|MiG-21]] or [[J35D]]. Because of this, and the low aerodynamic drag of the airframe, the airplane keeps energy very well. This feature can allow you to roll over opponents who have lost energy, and in case of failure, quickly retreat before the enemy has time to regain speed.

As a result, when playing the A32A, you should not rely on the aircraft's LTX. After all, the priority for an attack aircraft is armament, and here it is really good.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The airframe itself does not have a high survivability: the airplane, of course, can survive a machinegun burst or a couple of hits from a Soviet 23 mm cannon, but no more than that. The spars in the wings are quite fragile and are destroyed by several hits from air cannons and strong negative overloads. A downside is also its large profile, which greatly simplifies the enemy shooting at the machine.

In the fuselage and wings are installed treaded fuel tanks, which are quite rarely set on fire. Two pilots, fire suppression system and blocks of dipole reflectors also contribute to the survivability of the aircraft. The cockpit is protected by 5 to 15 mm thick armour, as well as 50 mm armoured glass, but this protection is enough for a few fragmentation shells, and armour-piercing 12.7 and 20 mm shells will easily penetrate this armour.

On the A32A, it is definitely not worth taking risks: any damage to the control surfaces or internal components of the machine immediately affects the controllability and control of the aircraft, which forces to withdraw from the battle and return to the airfield.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Akan m/49 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:
* 4 x 20 mm Akan m/49 cannons, nose-mounted (180 rpg = 720 total)

The 4 x 20 mm Akan m/49 cannons, which are a development of the Akan m/45, are mounted in the nose of the airplane. The cannons have a good rate of fire of 770 rounds per minute and a total ammunition capacity of 720 rounds, 180 per barrel. The cannon shells have good ballistics and low dispersion, which allows for effective fire at ranges up to 900 m, but insufficient damage does not allow to shoot down planes from several hits, forcing to shoot long bursts.

The following belts are available for the Akan m/49:
* Standard - a mixed tape, not bad against both air and ground vehicles;
* Ground targets - the tape is ineffective against aerial targets, and 38 mm armour-piercing shell penetration will not be enough to destroy armoured vehicles;
* Air targets - the most preferred tape against enemy aircraft and lightly armoured SAMs. The high-explosive shells are very effectively “sawing” planes, while the armour-piercing shells can easily deal with various lightly-armoured IFVs, BMPs or light tanks.

=== Suspended armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

* 32 x chaff
{{Navigation-End}}

For pilots are available:

'''Bombs'''

* 12 x 120 kg mb m/61 bombs - almost useless for hitting moving targets, requires jewel-like precision from the pilot;
* 5 x 250 kg mb m/50 bombs - a set for skillful pilots who are able to throw bombs as accurately and close to targets as possible.
* 3 x 500 kg mb m/56 bombs - not recommended due to the lower explosive quantity compared to the 600 kg m/50, while the same number of bombs can be hung on the aircraft;
* 3 x 600 kg mb m/50 bombs - a bomb that has proven itself on the B18B and A21A-3 due to its impressive TNT equivalent and large destruction radius. It is excellent at destroying bases and concentrations of ground vehicles;
* 3 x 500 kg Brandbomb m/58 incendiary tanks - useless against armoured vehicles, and one base requires as many as four discharges, besides, the incendiary mixture extinguishes very quickly before it can cause significant damage.

'''Rockets'''

* 24 x 14.5 cm psrak m/49B rockets - shaped charge rockets with 500 mm penetration, most effective against enemy armoured vehicles, but requires accuracy or multiple hits - difficulty is the location of rockets along the wings;
* 24 x 15 cm srak m/51 rockets - high-explosive rockets with 4.5 kg of TNT. Almost useless against all armoured vehicles with closed fighting compartment;
* 12 x 18 cm hprak m/49 rockets - slightly more powerful high-explosive rockets with 5.25 kg TNT. To destroy an enemy tank you need to hit exactly the roof of the turret or hull.

For air battles it is recommended to take three 600 kg bombs - enough to destroy one base. For ground battles, you can take 5 x 250 kg bombs - that's five potential knockouts, or load three 600 kg bombs - cheap and angry. From unguided rockets it is worth taking shaped m/49B - they can penetrate any armour on these combat ratings, and the overpressure will destroy open vehicles with one hit.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Air realistic battles'''

In Air RB you can take three 600 kg bombs - their total TNT equivalent is enough to destroy one base. Also take fuel for 30 minutes of flight, because most of the time you will have to fly with the afterburner on. After dropping bombs, you can return to the airfield, or try your luck against enemy aircraft. In this case, the use of the airplane is very similar to the use of early jets - you have to rely on the gained energy and speed, and do not get involved in dogfights. Just get enough speed and look for inattentive or energy-depleted opponents. The airplane is very good at conserving energy, so you'll have a good chance even against sluggish opponents like [[F-86 Sabre (Family)|Sabres]] and early [[MiG-21F-13|MiG-21s]], as long as you always leave yourself time to retreat. Don't be greedy and don't underestimate the enemy: if you let the enemy pass you forward due to your own negligence, you won't be able to throw him off your tail. Even if you are far away from the enemy, it does not mean that you are safe. It is very likely that a missile will be fired at you, so it is worth looking around regularly.

'''Ground realistic battles'''

In Ground RB, the airplane reveals its best side. Powerful suspended armament and ballistic calculator allow you to destroy several targets in one run and hide from enemy SAMs. Due to the airborne appearance, thrust problems are negligible, and closer to the tank battlefield you will have a very good reserve of speed and energy.

When selecting a suspended weapon, it is important to understand the situation on and above the battlefield. If there are enemy planes in the sky and SAMs on the ground, then take 3 x 600 kg m/50s - you can quickly drop them and move back to safe lines. If there is no threat from air and ground, or you are a battle-hardened pilot, take 5 x 250 kg bombs. They require an accurate hit near the tank, but that's five potential destructions. After the first run, don't rush to turn around and build a second run - you'll lose all speed, and the weak engine won't allow you to get it back quickly. It is better to just fly around the tank map from the side where you are not expected and strike again.

'''Simulator battles'''

In EC, the airplane using as an attack aircraft. It destroys bases, bombs convoys and doing CAS. Due to its poor flight performance, the airplane has no anti-air potential in this mode. In ground simulation battles, the A32A get into two main setups:

In the first set-up, you will be threatened by SAMs with radar: [[ZSU-23-4]] and [[ZSU-37-2]]. Dipole reflector blocks are good against them.

In the second set-up the enemy team will be equipped with SAMs, such as [[Strela-10M2]] and [[2S6]], and the sky will be dominated by [[MiG-21SMT]], [[F-5A]] and [[Su-25 (Family)|Su-25]].

And if in the first case you can somehow fight with the enemy armoured vehicles avoiding enemy radars and SAM fire, then in the second case the outdated subsonic attack aircraft will have no chance against enemy SAMs and SPAAs.

[[File:One of the early A32 concepts.jpg|thumb|One of the early A32 concepts]]
In 1946, the Royal Swedish Air Force formulated requirements for a two-seat all-weather attack aircraft, carrying powerful directional weapons, free-fall bombs, HVARs, and capable of reaching any point on the Swedish coast within one hour. Saab immediately began work on the project, which was designated P.1150.

Initially the aircraft was planned to use two engines, but due to the technical and operational problems of such a layout, it was decided to use a more mature, single-engine scheme. The engine of choice was the domestic RM4 produced by STAL. But problems with the development and start of its production forced the company to ask the British government to purchase a license for the Rolls-Royce Avon engine, which was frankly better than its Swedish counterpart.

During development, many interesting technical solutions were used, such as wings with high sweep angle, integrated radar and advanced electronics. For the new aircraft Saab engineers had to design a new ejection seat, which would allow to evacuate the pilot from a minimum height of 50 m. And to design the plane, a then-new method of mathematical modeling was used to predict the operational loads on the airframe.

As a result, the airplane had a sleek, mathematically correct and streamlined design that had excellent aerodynamics and could withstand significant positive and negative overloads. Wide wings with a 35° sweep, laminar wing profile, advanced mechanization and hydraulic aileron linkages provided excellent performance and stability, especially at low speeds. The front landing gear strut was located in the nose of the airplane under the cockpit, and the rear struts retracted into the wings. The air intakes were located on both sides of the cockpit and were smoothly integrated into the fuselage without creating excessive turbulence.
[[File:Launch of the Rb.04C.jpg|thumb|Launch of the Rb.04C]]
In the fall of 1952, test pilot Bent Olafo took the prototype into the air for the first time. A successful flight was followed by further flights, and during one of them, on October 25, the aircraft broke the sound barrier in a slight dive. In doing so, the Lansen became the first Swedish airplane to break the speed of sound. In 1954, Sweden received 17 Ps-431/A radars, which were developed to order by the French CSF. However, they were not put on the airplanes, but actively studied the design and production features. Later was launched production of a licensed version of this radar at Swedish factories, which was put on the A32A. However, for reasons of economy and the tactics used, the stations were installed on only a part of the aircraft - in the air squadron only one aircraft out of four had a radar.
[[File:A32A "Röd Adam" at the airbase.jpg|thumb|A32A "Röd Adam" at the airbase]]
The A32A "Lansen" was adopted into service with the Royal Air Force in 1955, replacing the piston-powered A21A-3 and B18B. The attack aircraft was a formidable machine at the time, carrying four 20 mm m/49 guns, bombs and unguided rockets of various calibres. In addition, the aircraft was actively testing the ability to carry Rb.04C anti-ship guided missiles. The airplane proved to be a reliable, fast and formidable fighting machine, but very responsive and obedient in the hands of the pilot. On the basis of the A32A they developed the J32B interceptor, the S32C reconnaissance aircraft, and the J32E REB aircraft. There were also plans to build a day fighter based on the A32 by installing an additional 30 mm cannon and four air-to-air missiles, but this initiative never left the drawing board. Between 1956 and 1997, 287 A32As, 118 J32Bs and 45 S32Cs served in the Royal Swedish Air Force, with a total of 456 aircraft produced. Three Lansen's are still flying at various airshows and participating in exhibitions.

=== F 17 Kallinge ===
[[File:F17 airbase.jpg|thumb|F 17 Wing airbase in Kallinge]]
The A32As served also as part of the F 17 Kallinge wing. The wing itself was formed in 1944 and was based at a former military training ground near Brekdakra. Initially the wing was involved in maritime operations such as sea lane mines and aerial reconnaissance, and operated [[B3C]] and [[B17B|B17]] bombers. In 1947, the wing was converted to a bomber wing, rearming with the [[B18B]] and [[T18B]]. In the early 50s, the wing received the [[A21RB|A21R]] jet and eventually the A32A. In 1973 the F 3 Östgöta wing was disbanded, from which the F 17 received two [[J35D]] squadrons, and eventually gave up the A32A. For the next two years the wing was purely fighter until in 1978 one of the two squadrons was replaced by a reconnaissance squadron manned by the latest SF/SH37s, and four years later the remaining squadron of Drakens was replaced by [[JA37C]]s. In 1993, the reconnaissance squadron was transferred to the F 10 Scania wing and replaced by a fighter squadron from the disbanded F 13 Bråvalla wing. In 2002, all aircraft in the wing were replaced by the versatile [[JAS39C]].

The A32A attack aircraft of this wing were featured in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuGX_u9nWuY 1957 short film], including the aircraft that became the prototype for the game version of the A32A "Röd Adam". It is distinguished by the F 17 Kallinge wing camouflage and the red letter "A" on the wing, from which its name was derived: "red" in Swedish is Röd, "A" in the phonetic alphabet is Adam.
