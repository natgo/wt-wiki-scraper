== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''A5M''', designated as the '''Type 96 Carrier-based Fighter ({{Annotation|九六式艦上戦闘機|Kyū Roku Shiki Kanjō Sentōki}})''', was the world's first carrier-borne monoplane, developed by Mitsubishi for the {{Annotation|IJNAS|Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service}} in 1934 and adopted in 1936. Being a marvel of early aviation, the A5M, which started out as company designation Ka-14, was a creation of Jiro Horikoshi and his team (the designer that would later develop the famous [[A6M (Family)|A6M 'Zero']]). Serving the Navy well during the Second Sino-Japanese War, it took part in the world's first aerial skirmishes between monoplane fighters built of mostly metal against Chinese [[P-26 (Family)|P-26 'Peashooters']], where it outperformed the Chinese aerial units by manoeuvrability and robust construction. This early workhorse of the Imperial Navy Air Service was highly favoured by its aircrews and fared well in battle. By 1938, the main rival of the A5M would become the fast and heavily armed [[I-16 (Family)|Polikarpov I-16]] flown by both Chinese pilots and Soviet volunteers.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27, and translates exactly over from reality, leading in monoplane manoeuvrability at the early ranks. It allows the pilot to evade and manoeuvre around their adversaries, as well as a presenting a decent airframe that can take a beating from regular munitions. However, it lacks in damage output, being equipped only with two 7.7 mm machine guns.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Like most Japanese planes, the A5M4 has no armour to protect the pilot and components of the plane. The best way to survive is to turn fight. Join a dogfight, make sure you can see your enemy at all times because it will only take a few good hits to the pilot or components to put this plane out of action.

{{main|Type 89 (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.7 mm Type 89 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (120 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Fighter role, staying low and using the extremely quick turn times to get on the tail on the enemy is essential. Keep an eye on ammo levels and well as your surroundings, this is an extremely weak aircraft in terms of armour. It is relatively fast in a straight line, but not as quick as much of the opposition it will be facing in the game. It is recommended to use speed against [[:Category:Biplanes|biplanes]] as their turn times are nearly matched if not better than this monoplane.

===Realistic battles===
The A5M4 can accelerate to 350 km/h in just less than a minutes time from takeoff. Will climb up to 2,500 m in around one minute and fifty seconds time when climbing in a 20-degree angle. Dive speeds are decent as the A5M4 will exceed 550 km/h in an 80-degree angle from just 2,500 m height. Be careful though, once the A5M4 reaches 560 km/h, the plane will violently shake about and if the throttle isn't cut, the plane wings may rip off. Though speed can be gained in the dive, energy is not easily retained, taking only a minute or so to fall to back to the maximum speed of 380 km/h with WEP or 360 km/h without.

Decent horsepower with the typical Japanese light aircraft would give the idea that the plane would be great in the vertical axis dog fighting. With a problem with keeping constant fuel flow as the plane changes the angle on its vertical axis means it is better to stick with horizontal dog fighting which isn't a bad thing as it will outturn most all contemporary aircraft.

=== Simulator mode procedures ===
Hands-off carrier take-off (Auto engine control): Ignite engine, flaps: raised, elevator trim: 6% up, aileron trim: 0%, rudder trim: 21% right, WEP throttle, hands off controls until the plane lifts off the carrier.

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
A single-seater, carrier-based, all-metal monoplane fighter with an open cockpit and fixed landing gear. The world's first carrier-based monoplane. A prototype of this fighter first flew on February 4, 1935. After extensive adjustments, the fighter was commissioned by the Japanese navy and designated carrier fighter type 96 (A5M). Mass production began in the fall of 1936.

In 1938, the fine-tuned A5M4 (model 4, later re-designated the model 24) variant was launched. This model had several new features: a new, more streamlined cockpit canopy with improved visibility, advanced fairings, and a radio transmitter. Since bombers often had to operate in the dark, the plane had landing lights and lights for flights over the open seas at night. The plane was equipped with a film camera near the left of the landing gear.

The power plant was a 9-cylinder radial air-cooled Nakajima Kotobuki 41 with a rated capacity of 795 horsepower. The plane had a two-bladed (later three-bladed) wooden variable pitch propellor, the Sumitomo VDM. Later planes began to use the Kotobuki 41KAI engine (which had roughly the same power), a design designated as model 34.

The A5M's armament consisted of two fuselage-mounted synchronous 7.7mm Nippon-Seikosho type 89 model 2 (Vickers "class E") machine guns with 500 rounds of ammunition each. Two 30-kg type 97 bombs could be carried under the wings. Under the fuselage, an additional 160-liter fuel tank could be carried. Later, this fuel tank was increased in size to 210 liters.

The A5M fighter saw action over China from September 1937 to September 1941. It was also active early on in the war in the Pacific, used for some time to defend Japan and the Marshall Islands. Afterwards, it was used for training missions and flight school. In 1945, the remaining A5M fighters were used for kamikaze missions.

Overall, the A5M met the contemporary requirements for a fighter. It was stable and manoeuvrable and was easy to control. However, the fighter's construction did not easily allow for upgrades, and it quickly became obsolete. Its armament was poor, its armour non-existent, its fuel tanks not self-sealing, and its wings overly weak.

Production of the A5M ceased in 1941. A total of 1,095 A5M fighters (of all variants) were produced.
