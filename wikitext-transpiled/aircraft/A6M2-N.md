== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was as a stop-gap solution for the slow development of the [[N1K1]], this [[A6M]] is the result of taking the [[A6M2 mod. 11]], modifying the tail, and adding 3 floats, with the center pontoon containing an additional fuel tank. While intended as an offensive measure for the Japanese island hopping campaign, it came too late to be used in its initial role but was continued to be used due to not requiring airfield infrastructure to operate, and used in patrol and defensive roles.

It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. Mainly just a way heavier version of the [[A6M2 mod. 11]], armament- and engine-wise nothing has changed and hence will perform worse than the regular [[A6M]] series due to the added weight of the pontoons. The pontoons can however break off from gunfire, overspeeding or ripping them off by means of ground, making the plane return to its ideal aerodynamics and weight.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The A6M2-N has no armor protection, and the fuel tanks are not self-sealing. Most major modules are located in the nose and wing roots of the plane, but there is also a fuel tank in the center pontoon. This means the pilot and major modules have very little protection, although from the front the engine can absorb shots before the injure the pilot. The pontoons are very large, and can absorb fire from surface targets (ships, SPAAGs, machine guns) or even a plane at a lower altitude. Most fuel is located in the center pontoon, so be careful not to lose that pontoon or else you will not have much more flying time.

* No Armor Protection
* Not Self-Sealing Fuel Tanks

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Grinding the A6M2-N will be depending what game modes that you play frequently. If it is Realistic or Simulator battles, it is best to focus on aircraft performance as you will be engaged in frequent manoeuvring engagements. In Arcade battles, it's better to focus on firepower as most of the time you will get into head-on attacks against other players.

== Armaments ==

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 99 Model 1 navy (20 mm)|Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 navy cannons, wing-mounted (60 rpg = 120 total)
* 2 x 7.7 mm Type 97 navy machine guns, nose-mounted (680 rpg = 1,360 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Navy Type 97 Number 6 (60 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (120 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Defensive Play'''

This play style is a common theme among all Japanese Zeroes, due to the fact that playing aggressive and going for head on attacks is not an option (no armour + wood frame + no self sealing tanks = fires!). In saying that, you want to stick to tactics that are purely defensive and only attack when someone attacks you and not vice-versa. If you do think you can attack, make sure that the enemy is within 1 km of you (2 km max). Once engaged you are in that fight till the end but if the fight goes sour, remember to turn in defensive manners and only manoeuvre in manners that will keep you safe and leave the chaser in a disadvantage where he has to or is forced into a recovery manoeuvre to keep up with you. But because you're a float plane, it's going to be a bit hard trying to turn so speed is everything, but luckily due to the weight being below the plane, downward turns are fast and quick but be warned... the neck of the main float has a oil cooler and the float itself has a massive fuel tank, so be more careful than you would be in a normal Zero.

* In Simulator, the A6M Zero is overall a great plane to fly. Its advantages include the extremely smooth handling, impressive turn rate despite having extra floats, low stall speed, the ability to not enter spins in extreme manoeuvres, and decent rear visibility. It is able to pull really tight turns or barrel rolls without losing control or going into a spin, allowing the player to use this stability to their advantage. Its disadvantages, however, are the fragile protection, wing-mounted guns with very little ammo, and the cockpit scattered with frames. Although not thick, these frames can still be obstructions in a fight. Also the gunsight is small and mounted very low, resulting in inadequate visibility over the nose. This can limit the player's ability to see the target in a turn fight since to lead the target, the player must cut inside its turn, meaning the nose will now block the target. The A6M can perform dogfighting, some ground pounding and some intercepting.
* You can bring the minimum amount of fuel (29 minutes) since this model of the Zero only has a 60-round drum per cannon, as a result you might need to constantly return to airfield to reload so there is no need to bring more fuel. Set the convergence to 150-300 m. When taking off, the A6M will shift severely to the left so it is best to set separate keybind for left and right brakes to counter the torque.
* For dogfighting, it is better to engage with an altitude advantage so climb to around 2,500 m. Track the opponent using lead or pure pursuit, as with lag pursuit you will eventually end up at the 6'o clock of the target aircraft whose fuselage will soak up most of your MG bullets, and your wing mounted cannons will become really awkward to aim. With the amazing stableness the aim should be easy. Target their wings or nose and avoid the back half of the fuselage as there is usually nothing in there. You can turn with most planes with your combat/takeoff flaps deployed. Note that it is best to fire in 5-round/half-second bursts to avoid wasting cannon rounds. Once the cannons are out, the leftover 7.7 mm MGs can only effectively damage single engine fighters.

* For ground pounding with bombs, look for tanks and pillboxes. First you need some separation between you and the target so you have enough time to line-up the drop. Dive at the target at a rather shallow angle, and release the 60 kg bombs when you are very close, with the target below the gunsight and filling up around half of it. If you only use the MGs, your targets are trucks, AAA and howitzers. Dive at it and stabilise the plane so the gunsight stays overall still at the target. Then, once the target fills out around 1/6 of the gunsight, open fire. If your aim is accurate you can destroy one target in a single pass. However, it is very recommended to set keybind for firing MG only as you can definitely not waste the valuable cannon rounds. Save them for any unexpected dogfights.
* Landing is easy thanks to the low stall speed and lovely handling. Line up and approach the airstrip at treetop, decrease speed to at most 210 km/h and deploy combat, takeoff and landing flaps in order. Further decelerate so the touchdown speed is no more than 180 km/h to avoid bouncing up.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

* I-16: the late I-16s are equipped with ShVAK cannons that can be pretty dangerous to your fragile airframe. They can turn equally well as the Zero, have superior roll rate but the stability is so terrible that as soon as they pull a little more on the stick, they will enter spins. Therefore it is quite easy to counter them: engage a turnfight with them and turn tighter and tighter, or do a few barrel rolls. They will quickly lose control and start spinning and it is quite hard to recover. Then simply get some separation, turn around and put some solid shots into them. They have an I-15's short and fat fuselage, a flat radial engine and triangular stabilisers located right after the low-mounted mono wings, all covered in olive green paint.

The single-seater, single-engine float seaplane fighter A6M2-N was created to cover combat operations near atolls, where the construction of airfields was often impossible.

Initially, the Kawanishi N1K1 Kyofu was planned for this purpose, but it soon became clear that Kawanishi was unable to produce the planes in sufficient quantity before the start of the war, so the navy asked Nakajima to create a float seaplane fighter. The A6M2 model 11, with non-folding wings, was chosen as a starting point. The landing gear was removed, and a large float with a built-in fuel tank installed in its place. A float was also installed under each wing for stability. The plane's armament was left unchanged.

Despite the significantly increased aerodynamic resistance and weight, the plane was quite fast and manoeuvrable.

327 of these aircraft were produced, including the original prototype, but the first A6M2-Ns barely ever took part in combat, since they were destroyed shortly after arriving at Tulagi (in the Solomon Islands) in an attack by U.S. B-17s from the 11th Bombardment Group.

They were used primarily as interceptors.
