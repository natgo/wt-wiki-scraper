== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Red Skies"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season IV, "Fearless Voltigeur"]].

The A6M6 mod. 53 was a prototype on the [[A6M5 Hei|A6M5 mod. 52C (Hei)]] developed to carry the Sakae 31a engine, featuring a water-methanol engine boost which slightly improves engine power but during testing proved unsatisfactory due to the unreliability of the prototype engine. It also includes fuel tanks that were made self-sealing.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

With the new Sakae 31a engine, the A6M6c has a water-methanol injection that makes the engine less vulnerable to overheating under WEP. The main flaw of this engine is that once the water-methanol mixture runs out, WEP cannot be utilized anymore. The [[B7A2]] also shares this similar flaw with the A6M6c. The WEP lasts for a total of 8 minutes, so it's recommended to conserve it once cruising altitude is reached. Saving a few minutes of WEP for a dogfight can make a vital difference in combat effectiveness. In total, the WEP setting adds 136 additional horsepower compared to 100% throttle setting.

The general flight performance of this Zero will match the traditional expectations. It is relatively light and nimble, it has an excellent turn rate, and it has great low altitude performance. However, when compared with other late war zeros such as the [[A6M5]] [[A6M5 Ko|Ko]]/[[A6M5 otsu|Otsu]], it feels much heavier and more sluggish. It also has a rather poor rate of climb. It behaves similarly to the [[A6M5 Hei]], and if the pilot is familiar with the Hei, the pilot can master the A6M6.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The A6M6c boasts pilot armour, armoured glass, and self-sealing fuel tanks, elements missing on earlier models of the A6M. It has increased survivability because of these bonus features. However, it isn't as tough as a P-51, as it is still a Zero, and the wings are vulnerable to incendiary rounds. The armour will save you, but you should not rely on it as your primary advantage.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

To master the A6M6c in the air, the pilot needs to channel all of the Zero's strengths and exploit them against the enemy. The primary goal is to set up a turning engagement and open fire roughly 300 m from the target in a turn. The Zero is vulnerable to energy fighting tactics, so it isn't recommended to boom and zoom, as the Zero isn't a fast aircraft. As the A6M6c has a poor climb rate, it is recommended to side climb slightly and engage targets that are low in energy and altitude. While side climbing, the most optimal angle to do so is at 20° maximum. This will allow you to climb without stalling your engines. When attacking bombers, your fighter cannot take much punishment so make sure to only pick targets that you can kill easily. An experienced bomber gunner can obliterate you out of the sky due to how relatively frail the Zero's airframe is.

=== Manual Engine Control ===

The Zero's manual engine controls are simple to learn. The propeller pitch should be kept at 95% at all times. The radiators both should be kept between 5 and 15% depending if you are on a hot or cold map. The second supercharger gear should be activated at 3,500 m and above. The Mixture can be kept at 60% percent for all altitudes.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful armament with good ammo count, the 13 mm MGs are effective
* Retains some of the famous manoeuvrability of the A6M series, makes for a capable dogfighter
* Has some armour, combined with better guns it makes the plane capable for bomber hunting
* Can carry effective rockets
* Stronger WEP than earlier Zeros
* Capable of carrier landing and takeoff
* Self-sealing fuel tanks increase the survivability

'''Cons:'''

* Heavier than other zeros, does not handle as well
* Mediocre climb rate, needs to side climb in order to gain altitude
* Vulnerable to incendiary rounds
* Very poor top speed
* Not potent at high altitude
* Limited WEP mode (only 8 minutes)

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In late 1944 into early 1945, the skies over the Pacific Ocean were ruled by US military aviation. The Japanese Empire was forced to deploy the already obsolete Zero against up-to-date Corsairs and Hellcats, because the development of new models of carrier-based fighter aircraft was delayed, and new Japanese army fighters often lacked range to win a tactical initiative. The design team of Mitsubishi did everything possible in an attempt to bring the Zero to the level of modern Allied combat aviation.

One of the latest versions of the Japanese carrier-based fighter was the Model 53 hei (A6M6c), developed after the design of the previous version, the A6M5 hei. Efforts to strengthen the structure and increase firepower were also traced in the new model: the A6M6c, like its predecessor, was armed with a pair of automatic cannons and three high-caliber machine guns, and also had protected wing tanks. In addition, this modification was supposed to install a new Nakajima Sakae 31 engine with a water-methanol injection system. As tests showed, the promising afterburner proved to be very unreliable in operation, so only a few A6M6c units were produced - one prototype at the Mitsubishi plant and several units of the testing batch at the Nakajima plant.
