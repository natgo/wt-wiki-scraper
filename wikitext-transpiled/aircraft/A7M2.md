The '''A7M2''', designated as '''Reppū Mod. 11 ({{Annotation|烈風一一型|Strong Wind, Model 11}})''', was a Japanese carrier-based fighter designed by Mitsubishi as the successor to the [[A6M]] ''Zero''. It was intended to have superior speed, climb, diving, and armament over the Zero, as well as better maneuverability. The development began in 1942, but faced many challenges due to engine selection and wing loading issues. The A7M2 was powered by a 2,200 hp Mitsubishi Ha-43 engine, and had a maximum speed of 627 km/h. It was armed with two 20 mm cannons and two 13 mm machine guns, or four 20 mm cannons. Only nine A7M2s were built before the end of the war, and none saw active service.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 "Royal Armour"]]. The A7M ''Reppū'' is a superior successor to the [[A6M]] ''Zero''. Offering enhanced firepower, with four 20 mm cannons and two 13.2 mm machine guns, compared to the Zero's two 20 mm cannons and two 7.7 mm machine guns. The A7M also has a higher top speed of 628 km/h, thanks to its more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics, while retaining a similar level of agility and maneuverability as the Zero. The A7M is suitable for both beginners and experts, as it can outmaneuver most enemies in a dogfight, catch up with more foes than the Zero in a chase, and carry plenty of ammunition to sustain prolonged engagements. The A7M also has some versatile rockets that can destroy both air and ground targets with; The rockets can be used to surprise enemy bombers or fighters with its distance fuse, or to attack ground vehicles or installations with their impressive payload. However, the rockets are heavy and reduce the A7M's performance, so they should be used wisely and sparingly.

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The A7M Reppu was designed to be an improved version of the famed A6M Zero fighter, and as such, retains some of its legendary older brother's characteristics. The Reppu is an overall smooth operator at most altitudes thanks to its decent acceleration, vastly improved speed and decent manoeuvrability. Less manoeverable than the Zero, it can at certain times really struggle in dogfights, the rudder has a want to fight you at every turn requiring forceful control and slight damage to the airframe negates most of its ability to dogfight anything but the slowest turners effectively. The most noteworthy change is the replacement of the underpowered Nakajima Sakae Radial engine with a significantly more powerful Mitsubishi Ha-43 Radial. This new engine propels the Reppu to higher speeds previously unobtainable by the Zero and turns this aircraft from a nuisance to a universally feared opponent.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

While being slightly more durable than its older brother, the Reppu is still very vulnerable to any kind of battle damage. Anything with greater than .50 calibre weapons will be able to take off a wing or worse. The wingspan has also increased significantly to keep the manoeuvrability of the Zero while supporting increased weight added from the guns, engine and other updates. A downside is that this makes the wings easier to hit. However, The manoeuvrability of the Reppu allows this aircraft to avoid most damage if you can keep turning.

The A7M2 ''Reppu'' that takes the best of the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]] and does it better also translates it in aerial combat. With its higher engine output, very similar manoeuvrability and higher rip-speeds, it can engage in all playstyles; whether the situation calls for it the A7M can either turn fight, Boom-&-Zoom, energy fight and others. Yet it is sometimes tricky to maintaining energy fights with enemies like the [[F6F-5]], [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]], etc.

===Tactics===

;;Ground pounding

While Japan isn't exactly a nation that has a lot of ground pounding capacity with the mainstay theatre being the Pacific, the A7M2 is the lowest battle rating Japanese plane that boasts heavy rockets that can destroy the heaviest of ground targets. Together with the fact they are fired separately, 2 kills are easy with proper aiming.

Along with the rockets, it boasts 13.2 mm & 20 mm guns on a very manoeuvrable platform making it very easy to just stay close to ground level, re-adjusting on target and diving in on vehicle roofs and blasting engines & turret crew.

;;Low altitude fighting

This is where the {{PAGENAME}} shines and players familiar with the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]] will feel right at home. Newer players will become familiar with its playstyle quite easily due its better performance and more forgiving yet punchier gun-choice with plenty of ammo to spare.

Only couple of planes like Spitfires can be a challenging opponent at low altitudes, mainly because most planes will lose energy when fighting with the A7M2 at low altitudes when the A7M2 is able to outturn and be on their tail in couple seconds. The 13 mm and 20 mm armaments combined are very deadly and will tear down a plane in a good placed burst. Aim for center of mass when turn fighting, and tail when tailing, especially the elevators.

;;High altitude fighting

Turn fighting at high altitude is rather difficult since, the higher you go, the less dense the air is. This means there will be less air to lift your plane when doing a hard turn compared to sea level, meaning the A7M2 will not be able to turn as fast as you do at sea level. This should be taken into consideration since most of the planes at high altitudes (4+ km) often have superchargers or turbochargers and will make an easy prey out of you, as you do not maintain the same energy nor speed they maintain.

;;Bomber Interception

The drawbacks from high altitude does not stop the A7M1 from fighting in the clouds. One of the easiest targets for the A7M2 are bombers. They are big, have big wingspans and are often slow (unless they are dive bombers or strike fighters). They can be easily destroyed with the 13 mm and 20 mm armaments due to their sheer calibre and destructive ammunition. When engaging a bomber, aim for the engines or wings. With the right belts equipped, a few well placed shots will set them afire or even shred the wings.

Be careful when engaging bigger preys as they might turn into a predator if handled wrongly. Hit fast and hard, put bullets into the cockpit or make short work of their wings. Do not tail it, most bombers will shred the '''A7M''' badly and a fire is most guaranteed, which the '''A7M''' won't last long through.

As the [[A7M1 (NK9H)|A7M1]] was a letdown for the navy, which made them want to cancel the project still allowed Mitsubishi to develop into making an A7M with an in-house engine, being the Mitsubishi Ha-43 which had more power and would be the engine to succeed to the Navy's requirements.

As so, the new [[A7M2]] with Ha-43 had its test flight in October 1944 by no-one other than Saburo Sakai and proved more than capable with checking off most requirements by some slight underperformance of speed. As the aging A6M doesn't compare to the A7M2, the Navy cancelled the formal cancelation of the A7M project and adopted the A7M2 as their new main carrier-based fighter.

In late 1944 an earthquake strained the manufacturing of the A7M2 causing only 8 to be built. In early 1945, Allied bombings of Japans mainland lead to the destruction of the A7M plans. This ceased the whole development of the A7M2 and the plane would never see combat.

Only a single A7M2 would be built in 1945 due to allied bombings and none remain surviving WWII.
