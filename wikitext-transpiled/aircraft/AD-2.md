== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"]].

The Skyraider is one of the most iconic propeller-driven ground attack aircraft of the Korean and Vietnam wars. Likewise, its armament certainly lives up to that. Even early on, the 12 HVARs you have can be devastating when used against light pillboxes and medium tanks, quickly turning a very tidy profit with a total of 8 possible launches. Generally your job is to inflict as much damage on the enemy tickets as possible, through pillboxes, ships and tanks.

The AD-2 Skyraider is a high rank American monoplane strike aircraft with a perfect combination of flight performance and payload. It has decent performance and guns, and can carry a massive payload of well over 4,000 lb of equipment, including rockets, bombs, and torpedoes. The Skyraider has a far forward cockpit, improving visibility and an airbrake capable enough of dealing with steep dives for maximum time on target.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
When used in all battle modes, be sure to steer clear of enemy fighters, pick the ground targets that are farthest away from the usual dogfight zones, for example, the far left base on Alternate History Krysmk has plenty of targets and is seldom visited by Soviet aircraft. One of the first weapon modifications you can unlock are torpedoes, a weapon which while seldom used, can turn a very quick profit when aiming for a light cruiser, destroyer or a Japanese aircraft carrier (as British and American ones are far more difficult to sink). With that, you can quickly grind down the payload line until you can carry your maximum ordnance. Once fully upgraded, choose your payload based on your skills in bombing and rockets. If you find you're better at rockets, load Tiny Tims and aim for heavy targets once your HVARs are used. Otherwise load up the 3,000 lbs of bombs and obliterate any position you feel.

=== Counter-tactics ===
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->
The Skyraiders have a surprising level of manoeuvrability when they are clean of their ordnance. When engaging keep your energy at all cost, because if that AD dumps his load, all he has to do is drain you of your ability to run to be able to gain the advantage and take you out.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Easy to fly
* Low stall speed
* Handles well at low speed
* Excellent payload options
* Well armoured
* Very efficient at killing ground units especially when escorted by friendly fighters
* Cheap and reasonable repair costs in all modes

'''Cons:'''

* Very sluggish with full payload
* Poor offensive armament compared to contemporaries
* Cannons overheat quickly when not upgraded
* Large target, easy prey for fighters
* Slow in level flight
* High turn time
* Air brakes can be damaged on touchdown if deployed during landing

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The piston-engine Skyraider was designed during World War II to meet United States Navy requirements for a carrier-based, single-seat, long-range, high-performance dive/torpedo bomber. It was equipped with the 2,700 HP Wright 3350 Duplex-Cyclone Engine, the same engine that equipped to the B-29 Superfortress Bomber. It was designed to replace the Helldiver and the Avenger torpedo bombers as the Navy's primary attack craft. Unfortunately, it didn't serve in WWII due to the program being delayed. It went on to serve with distinction in later wars such as Korea and Vietnam.
