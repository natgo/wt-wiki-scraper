== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In the late 1950s, France received around 93 AD-4 airframes as part of the US Navy's surplus. 40 Skyraiders were the NA variant meanwhile the rest were AD-4Ns.  It featured four 20 mm cannons, a strengthened undercarriage, and other minor changes. Escadron II/20 was the first squadron to receive the Skyraiders in 1960, and two more squadrons would receive them. French Skyraiders were in service for just over ten years until they were considered obsolete and retired.

Introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is an extremely effective ground striker. It can utilize many different types of bombs and rockets. In addition, the four 20 mm cannons have ample ammunition and good penetration performance with the armoured target belt. The cannons perform very well against light tanks and medium-strength ground targets like light pillboxes. However, this all comes at the cost of performance. Although the AD-4 has the mighty Wright R-3350-26WA (WA for water injection), it has abysmal manoeuvring energy retention and is overall a heavy aircraft. For a few turns the Skyraider can turn tight but it quickly becomes slow and vulnerable to enemy fighters. Nonetheless, the Skyraider is an excellent ground attack aircraft with an abundance of options for players.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Considering the size, weight, and engine of the aircraft, the AD-4 still maintains a good top-end speed and gets there in a reasonable time, though nowhere as fast as comparable fighters get to theirs. Skyraider pilots will find their plane able pull a great instantaneous turn rate to keep up with fighters or other aircraft that end up on the business end of the AD-4's cannons, though their plane will very quickly lose a lot of speed thanks to its incredibly high weight. Sustained turns are not a strength of the AD-4 by any means, and the introduction of any verticality into manoeuvres will emphasis this weakness even further; the plane has rather terrible energy retention.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 40 mm Bulletproof glass in front of the pilot.
* 9.5 mm Steel plates under the engine.
* 9.5 mm Steel plate behind pilot.

The AD-4 also has a single, large self-sealing fuel tank placed behind the pilot's steel plate. The oil cooling systems are found behind the engine, protected from ground fire by the same steel plates. Both of the steel plates are capable of preventing the penetration of HE shells. It is thick enough to block AP shells from 7.92 mm machine guns at longer ranges, and 7.62 mm machine guns at all but point-blank ranges, giving the AD-4's engine and pilot excellent survivability from rifle-calibre ground fire.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M3 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm M3 cannons, wing-mounted (200 rpg = 800 total)

The four cannons are arranged in bundles of two, mounted in each wing. Each has an ammunition load of 200 rounds, and all fire simultaneously. All cannons exhaust their ammunition supply at the same time.

The 20 mm M3 is an excellent all-rounder cannon, dealing consistently lethal damage to enemy aircraft with both API-T and HEF-I shells, but also being able to pierce lightly armoured tanks with API-T shells, which can penetrate 27 mm of RHA at 500 m, enough to deal with nearly every light tank the AD-4 will encounter. However, the M3's accuracy without the "New 20 mm cannons" modification is exceptionally poor, with hit probabilities outside 500-600 m becoming very low due to high bullet spread.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The AD-4 is a well-suited aircraft for its primary role — ground attack — and provides the pilot with a large variety of highly effective payload options for dealing with different types of targets. Depending on the pilot's preference, the French AD-4 has access to over twenty options for suspended armaments, consisting mostly of different types of bomb/rocket hybrid payloads.

There are three primary rocket selections available to the French AD-4; twelve HVAR rockets, twenty-four T10 151 AP rockets, and twenty-four T10 140 HE rockets. Each rocket type can be used with the full range of hybrid payloads, which includes a Mk.13-1 Case torpedo, two Tiny Tim rockets, or a selection of bomb set-ups including 2,000 lb bombs, 1,000 lb bombs, 500 lb bombs, or combinations of the three as listed above. Your choices will vary based on your expected target type and game mode. T10 T151 rockets plus two Tiny Tims, for instance, may be the best option for dealing with enemy anti-air in ground.

The AD-4's biggest enemy is opposing fighter planes. The Skyraider is a massive, heavy, and difficult to manoeuvre target, and enemy fighters will have no trouble sticking to one like glue. AD-4 pilots will need to take this into consideration when entering the combat area. The AD-4 is quite survivable, so it can take head-ons in spite of its wing-mounted guns, and deal considerable damage with the AN/M3s, though it may often be better to wait for friendly fighter cover or retreat immediately to allied anti-air once the threat of enemy air arises.

The AD-4 is part of a long line of piston-engined attack aircraft developed by the Douglas Aircraft Company, starting with the A-1 Skyraider, seeing service across the globe in various ground strike roles. The variant of the French AD-4 represented in War Thunder is the French AD-4NA, a variant of the formerly three-seated AD-4N night attack plane which was converted to a single-seated attacker in American Service before being sold to France, though France did also come into possession of the AD-4N.

Having notably served during the Korean War under the USN and USAF, the Skyraider attracted many potential buyers including France who acquired 40 AD-4NA and 53 AD-4N aircraft from the US Navy Surplus in 1959. The Skyraider saw service in France's Armée de l'Air starting in 1960, during the Algerian War being sent against the Front de Libération Nationale, a movement fighting for the independence of Algeria from French rule. When the country gained independence in 1962, the AD-4 was relegated to service in Djibouti, then called the French Territory of Afars and the Issas. The French AD-4s last saw combat in Chad, where the French used them to support the government against Islamic guerilla forces in the area.

These French AD-4s were subsequently sold onwards to other countries such as Cambodia and Chad, where they saw further use under those flags.<ref name="Francillion" />
