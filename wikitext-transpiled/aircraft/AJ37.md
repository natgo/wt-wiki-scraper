== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}'''  was the ground attack variant of the SAAB 37 Viggen. The aircraft received precision guided ground weaponry, like RB 04 Anti-Ship missiles and RB 05 air to surface missiles, which will later be replaced by the AGM-65 Maverick for dealing with fortifications and enemy armour, the aircraft also received the ability to carry bombs and rockets, while retaining its capability to carry AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles for self defence. A total of 108 units were built with deliveries starting in mid 1971.

It was introduced in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]].The Swedish AJ37 is a relatively capable fighter for air battles but it is much more capable at dealing with ground targets. It features external cannons and 2 x RB24J missiles for self defence, the issue being that the cannons occupy the slots used to carry countermeasures. For ground battles, the aircrafts best weapon is the RB75 (AGM-65B Maverick) which is a very capable long range TV guided missile used against armoured units. For air battles, it has a decent flight performance, but being a very heavy airframe it suffers at low speeds, thus is very recommended staying at high speeds and only turn in favourable situations.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

Entering service in 1971, the {{PAGENAME}} is almost 10 years older than the [[JA37C]] found in the fighter line beside it. Despite being almost indistinguishable from each other visually, both aircraft differ heavily in flight performance. The {{PAGENAME}} is noticeably more primitive than its fighter brethren, requiring suspended ordnance to compensate for the lack of internal weapons. This, combined with the weaker powerplant, makes the {{PAGENAME}} feel a lot heavier when fully kitted out. Despite this, the performance is not something to underestimate, as the Viggen platform still offers almost unmatched 'jack of all trades' performance, with excellent manoeuvrability, acceleration, and top speed.
[[File:AJ37 Scenery.png|left|thumb|350px|AJ37 viewed from behind, making a right turn.]]
For better or worse, flying the {{PAGENAME}} is comparable to the Draken family of fighters preceding it. The overall flight performance is so extreme that most opponents the {{PAGENAME}} comes across cannot keep up with it. But a trade-off is still the lack of significant energy retention. When flown recklessly, the {{PAGENAME}} has a hard time keeping its speed up, which can be exploited by more powerful opponents. However, an opponent that does commit to these low speeds is likely to lose due to the low-speed handling of the Viggen. All variants, including the {{PAGENAME}}, come fit with flap systems designed to push air under the main wing, allowing the aircraft to manoeuvre efficiently even when stalling. Because of this, dogfighting often comes down to managing your speed, and ensuring that your manoeuvrability is better than your opponent's, either by forcing an overshoot, or baiting them into committing to a low-speed engagement.

[[File:AJ37 Countermeasures.png|thumb|350px|AJ37 dispensing countermeasures]]
Although designed with air-to-ground missions in mind, the {{PAGENAME}} does not come equipped with pilot protection. Despite its size, the {{PAGENAME}} is not well-suited for handling incoming damage. The fuselage is noticeably tanky, but due to the large engine and control surfaces, the likelihood of surviving hits without consequence is fairly small.

The stock loadouts on the {{PAGENAME}} allow for either gunpods or air-to-air missiles. The performance of the RB24J often allows two guaranteed air kills, which can be important when spading the aircraft. However, more skilled pilots might find more use out of the Akan gun pods as they can down significantly more aircraft in one go and still engage ground targets if needed. They can be somewhat tricky to get used to, however, as they are spaced out from the center of the aircraft, both horizontally and vertically.

The m/70 rockets are the only air-to-ground ordnance shared with the JA37C. The rockets allow for great precision attacks from far range thanks to the ballistic computer, and due to the large explosive filler, a single accurate hit is more than enough to deal with any armoured threat. The rocket placement can be somewhat tricky as they are not centred with the aircraft, similar to the gun pods.

[[File:AJ37 bombs.png|thumb|350px|AJ37 bombing targets]]
The Rb05A is unique in its class, as this manually guided air-to-ground missile features a proximity fuze for attacking airborne threats. Although very unconventional to use, this missile is highly potent in ground battles, as the explosive can kill any tank it hits, while also destroying helicopters with ease if needed.

The RB 75 is identical to the [[AGM-65A]] found on other aircraft and performs equally well. This air-to-ground missile uses optical guidance to distinguish targets, allowing it to guide itself after launch. Since the missile is capable of gliding up to 20 km of distance, altitude is preferred when deploying for the best distance and target visibility. When employed correctly, the {{PAGENAME}} can safely stay away from SAM systems while engaging ground vehicles.

The countermeasures used by the {{PAGENAME}} are carried in two pods, one on each wing. Both come equipped with 24 slots each, dispensing in unison when activated. These flares require some manoeuvring and throttle management to deploy efficiently, especially since the direction they dispense is straight behind the nozzle. Cutting afterburner and banking slightly is always optimal when flaring, and will throw off most heat-seeking missiles.

The 120 kg m/71s are the only type of bombs found on this aircraft. Carried in groups of four, these bombs are dispensed singularly starting from the left. Their limited explosive mass makes them fairly inefficient at destroying bases in air battles. However, the precision offered by the ballistic computer allows for plenty of stopping power against ground vehicles. These bombs are also a lot safer to use than unguided rockets, as they do not require the pilot to look directly at the target.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Air Realistic Battles'''

* Always carry RB24Js, flares, and guns
* Take as much fuel as possible
* Avoid higher altitudes
* Stay as fast as possible when engaging aircraft
* Use RWR to notch enemy radar missiles when uptiered
* Use flares reinforced

[[File:AJ37 Climb.png|thumb|350px|AJ37 seen climbing]]
The {{PAGENAME}} has no limitations when it comes to flight performance. The acceleration, manoeuvrability, and top speed outclasses almost any aircraft it faces, giving it plenty of wiggle room for engaging anything it wants. With the addition of custom loadouts, the AJ37 is now able to carry a gunpod and flare pod simultaneously. The downside lies in the suspended weaponry, which is very limited for a plane its size. These downsides are entirely dependent on the opponents a pilot is going against, as some aircraft might have even less to work with than the {{PAGENAME}}, making them easy prey. In downtiers, the {{PAGENAME}} can become unstoppable as the armament becomes secondary. Since the {{PAGENAME}} is one of the best handling supersonic aircraft, facing subsonic and transonic opponents is a walk in the park. When facing these sorts of aircraft, firepower should always be prioritized to maximize the amount of damage the plane can put out. Here, a pilot should focus on going straight in, keeping opponents busy for allied teammates.

When facing more potent opponents, however, especially those at higher tiers, the lacklustre weaponry becomes apparent. The {{PAGENAME}} carries half the expected amount of missiles and has no all-aspect capability. On top of this, opponents at this tier often carry potent missiles that require flares to properly avoid. A loadout with flares, RB24J missiles, and a gun pod is necessary. In these matches, it's imperative to stick to teammates or focus on a lone enemy plane.

'''Ground Realistic Battles'''

* Use countermeasures when facing SAM systems
* Use suspended weaponry of your choice
* Gain altitude quickly when using RB 75
* Stay as low and fast as possible when using rockets, bombs, cannons, or the Rb05As

Using the AJ37 for its intended purpose can sometimes be trickier than fighting aircraft, especially due to the prominent threat of SAM systems. The AJ37 is much more potent compared to the earlier [[A32A]] in almost every regard, but that does not make it immune to anti-air equipment. The best way to counter SAM systems is by flying at high speeds while deploying chaff simultaneously. This forces radar locks to reset, allowing for short timeframes of efficient ground striking. Staying above Mach is almost a requirement, unless terrain can be worked with to avoid sightlines with the SAM launcher. A more daring tactic is to forego countermeasures altogether, and focusing on destroying the SAM system before it even locates the aircraft. This allows for more variety in the suspended ordnance, doubling the number of bombs or rockets, or allowing the use of Akans to combat air targets at the same time.

This mentality does not apply when using the RB 75, as this missile allows for much further distance when engaging. With over 20 km of launch range, the Maverick missile is able to stay out of the range of ground-based SAM equipment, while still engaging ground targets. The optimal strategy here is to gain altitude directly after spawning, trying to separate a great distance from the battlefield. A great way to check for optimal distance is watching the capture-point marker that tells distance, as it gives a rough estimate of your current range. When beyond 12 km, the average distance a SAM system can reach, a pilot can begin checking for targets on the ground through the sight. Once a target is acquired, turn back and repeat the process. Due to the limited armament, it can be quite handy to carry a second ordnance option or to simply climb near the airfield for quick rearming.

{{Notice|Remember to check for helicopters when using the Rb05A missile! The proximity fuze allows for them to be easily taken down.}}
