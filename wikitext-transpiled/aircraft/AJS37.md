== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

The AJS37 was a Swedish fighter-bomber aircraft which originated from the [[AJ37]] due to a decision in 1992 to upgrade the AJ37, SH37, and SF37 to give them an extended service-life and limited JAS-capabilities. The majority of the upgrade was to the avionics in the Central Calculator, which received extensive modification. Giving more powerful computer power gave it the ability to carry new ordnance such as [[RB 74]] air-to-air missiles, RB 15F anti-ship missiles, and BK 90 cluster munitions. After the modification, the AJ 37 was redesignated to AJS 37. The AJS remained in service until 2001 when it was phased out in favour of the JAS 39 Gripen.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High top speed at sea level
* Responsive flight controls with great turning rate
* Can be equipped with a drop tank
* Reverse Thrust for fast braking after touching down
* Access to strong RB74 IR missiles

'''Cons:'''

* Substandard energy retention during turns, made worse by the mediocre acceleration at low speeds
* Afterburner consumes a lot of fuel
* Mediocre airbrakes
* No internal mounted cannon, only external 30 mm cannons without tracers
* Flaps only useful during landings
* Very limited loadout options as guns, countermeasures, air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles all compete for the same slots
* AGM-65A as only guided air-to-ground ordnance, with a lock-on-range on moving targets of only 4km or less
