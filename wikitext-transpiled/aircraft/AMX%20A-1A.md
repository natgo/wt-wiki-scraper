== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Brazilian Air Force (FAB) needed a replacement for the obsolete AT-26 Xavante light attack and training aircraft. In 1981, after extensive negotiations between the countries, the Brazilian company Embraer was invited to take part in the Italian project of the AMX, resulting in the AMX-International consortium. The project was split into three companies: 46.7% for Aeritalia (including the central fuselage), 23.6% for Aermacchi (which included the front fuselage), and 29.7% for Embraer (including the wings, landing gear, and disposable fuel tanks). The first prototype of the AMX first flew on 15 May 1984. The Brazilians decided to use two 30 mm DEFA cannons as primary armament instead of a 20 mm minigun. The AMX entered service with the FAB in 1989 and was upgraded to the A-1M standard in 2013, almost the same version as the Italian AMX A-11A ACOL.

Introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is pre-upgrade to the A-1M standard. Compared to the Italian [[AMX|A-11A]], the AMX A-1A has different armaments as primary weapons with two powerful 30 mm DEFA cannons, air-to-air missiles such as the MAA-1 Piranha, and other kinds of rockets and bombs. The AMX A-1A is a perfect vehicle for CAS in ground RB with its guided bombs, capable of making easy work of enemy tanks.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Powerful anti-air missile MAA-1
* Excellent acceleration and flight performance
* Guided bombs
* Powerful 30 mm DEFA cannons
* LITENING can lock onto planes, providing advanced gun aim assist against aircraft (generally a feature only expected of a 11.0+ plane with a radar)

'''Cons:'''

* No Afterburner
* Subsonic, can only reach Mach 1 in dive
* Can rip the wings when having too much G-overload during a turn
* HEF and HEI ammunition have a different velocity than API-T, which causes the ballistic computer to flash when shooting with most available ammunition belts

During the late 1970s, the Italian Air Force specified a set of requirements for a new aircraft to replace the outdated G.91 and F-104 in their respective roles of ground attack and aerial reconnaissance. Aeritalia and Aermacchi entered a joint venture to develop the new aircraft, with work on the project commencing in 1978. By 1980, Brazil was also looking into modernizing their strike aircraft fleet and thus expressed interest in joining the development of the new aircraft. After agreeing on the requirements in 1981, Embraer joined the consortium, subsequently named AMX International.

Focusing on designing a light and cost-efficient strike aircraft, development of the new aircraft progressed quickly. The first prototype of the aircraft flew in 1984 and following a successful test period, the AMX entered production in 1988. Due to the shared development effort, the Italian and Brazilian variants of the aircraft only differ in minor aspects. After entering service, Italian AMX aircraft participated in operations during the Balkan Wars of the 1990s and Libya in 2011 where the type distinguished itself in combat. The AMX is still in active service Brazilian air forces to this day, while in Italy they were just retired in 2024.
