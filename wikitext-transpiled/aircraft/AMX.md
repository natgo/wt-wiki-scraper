== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''AMX International AMX''', known in Italian service as '''A-11 ''Ghibli''''', is a joint venture between Alenia and Aermacchi of Italy, and EMBRAER of Brazil. Italy initiated a requirement for a new aircraft to replace the Fiat [[G.91 Y]]'s that were in service, while Brazil joined the venture primarily to replace an Italian aircraft in their service, the Aermacchi MB-326. After several prototypes, the AMX was adopted into service by the air forces of both Italy and Brazil. Initially, the primary variant in service was the A-11A, with the AMX-T serving as the dual-seater trainer variant. The AMX served for many decades and demonstrated its worth in multiple deployments. The AMX ACOL was a further upgrade which outfitted 55 AMX-11A aircraft with new avionics. These enhancements included the addition of an INS/GPS navigation system, new communication systems, IFF, and new HUD displays. The most significant addition to the upgrade was the capability to deploy smart munitions, such as JDAM bombs, which later played an essential role in its deployment in Afghanistan.

It was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]]. As a subsonic strike aircraft, it will fly similarly to other planes in its role, such as the [[A-10A|A-10]], [[Su-25 (Family)|Su-25]], [[Harrier (Family)|Harrier]], and, most notably, the [[A-6E TRAM]], the variant featured in the game is the A-11A. While it is capable of carrying up to two AIM-9Ls and comes equipped with internal countermeasures, it can also be used, though not intended, in an air-to-air role. This is preferably done when the pylons aren't loaded with ordnance, as it significantly affects the plane's performance. When utilized for its intended role, the AMX can carry up to six GBU Paveway II guided bombs or eight "dumb" unguided bombs. These capabilities can be devastating for enemy ground forces while showcasing the AMX's value as a formidable Close Air Support plane for allied forces.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Great payload options
** GBUs and thermals provide strong and accurate ground strike options for Ground Battles
* Internal mounted countermeasures
* Relatively nimble for a strike aircraft
* AIM-9Ls are potent in a downtier
** Gun radar can be used to detect enemies or slave your AIM-9Ls

'''Cons:'''

* Rather limited ammo for Vulcan standards
* Slow acceleration at lower speeds, struggles with larger payloads
* Subsonic speed
** Bleeds most of its energy in dogfights quickly, poor acceleration means you will almost always be on the defensive
* Once your AIM-9Ls are expended you are mostly helpless

== History ==

The story of AMX International began with a joint cooperation between Alenia-Aermacchi of Italy and EMBRAER of Brazil. The project emerged from the need to find a suitable replacement for the [[G.91 Y]] and to assume its role as a ground attacker. The [[G.91 Y]] was becoming outdated and unreliable, prompting the search for a more modern aircraft. Italy also sought an advanced multi-role platform with reconnaissance capabilities. Brazil joined the collaboration to replace the outdated Aermacchi MB-326, which was not adapted for modern warfare.

After several years of development, setbacks in the form of accidents, and prototype testing, the A-11 officially entered service in Italy by 1989. One of its main advantages as a fighter and attack aircraft is its significantly lower costs compared to its competitors. The A-11s are equipped with a variant of the EL/M-20001B radar, manufactured by Fiar in Italy and designed by Elta in Israel.

The A-11A has an extensive service record, thanks to its versatile armament options, including AIM-9L infrared-guided Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, as well as various bombs, rockets, and {{Annotation|PGM|Precision-Guided Munitions}}s. The Italian version features a 20 mm M61A1 Vulcan cannon, while the Brazilian version uses 30 mm Defa cannons due to a U.S. veto on the M61A1 cannon for Brazil.

For defence, the AMX is equipped with an active and passive electronic countermeasures system supplied by Elettronica, with the {{Annotation|RWR|Radar Warning Receiver}} mounted inside the tail fin. In terms of performance, the A-11 can reach speeds of 1053 km/h, thanks to the Rolls-Royce Spey 807 turbofan engine, providing a range of 889 km. Its rate of climb and service ceiling are impressive for an aircraft of its type.

Later in its service life, the A-11 received an upgrade known as the A-11B / AMX ACOL ({{Annotation|Aggiornamento Capacità Operative e Logistiche; Update to Logistical and Operative Capabilities}}), a mid-life update aimed at enhancing logistical and operative capabilities. This update included new avionics, an INS/GPS navigation system, improved communications systems, {{Annotation|IFF|Identification Friend or Foe}}, and new HUD displays. The most significant addition was the ability to deploy smart munitions, such as JDAM bombs, allowing A-11s to provide better close air support in Afghanistan. The A-11B first flew in September 2005, with the first batch of upgraded aircraft delivered in March 2007. The A-11B remains in service and is likely to continue so for the foreseeable future.
