== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the late '80s, the new AV-8B was starting to show its shortcomings as a "day attacker", and therefore a "night attacker" variant was proposed. This variant would have advanced navigation and targeting systems for nighttime strikes, relying on FLIR thermal imaging, day/night color maps, and various other improvements. One of the largest upgrades was the addition of the Hughes AN/ASB-19 FLIR targeting sight in the nose, similar to that found on the [[Harrier GR.7|British Harrier IIs]], allowing for highly accurate bombing, navigation, and guidance of precision ordnance in almost all weather conditions and times of day. This new variant was originally going to be designated the AV-8D, but to avoid complications, was redesignated to the AV-8B (NA), with NA standing for "Night Attack". All initial AV-8Bs were upgraded to either the AV-8B NA or the [[AV-8B Plus|AV-8B+]] standard, the latter of which was a further upgrade of the AV-8B which integrated more advanced avionics, a built-in radar, and AIM-120 capability.

Introduced in [[Update "Dance of Dragons"]], the AV-8B (NA) is a very strong aircraft at its BR, being directly better than the other Harrier at this BR, the [[Sea Harrier FRS.1]], in almost every way. What the AV-8B (NA) lacks in BVR capability, due to its lack of radar or long-range missiles, is made up for in the incredible flight performance, great IR missiles for its battle rating, and the VIFFing (Vector In Forward Flight) potential using the thrust vectoring nozzles, allowing the Harrier to catch enemies off guard and turn almost any low-speed dogfight in its favour. However, where the AV-8B Night Attacker truly shines is in the attacker role, as its name implies. The AV-8B NA has access to one of, if not the best, ground strike packages at its battle rating in ground battles, with the capability to use a plethora of guided ordnance such as the laser-guided Paveways and AGM-65E, the TV-guided AGM-65D and G, and the GPS-guided JDAMs, along with various other unguided weapons. The GAU-12 Equalizer 25 mm rotary cannon also has access to a very high fire rate and a very punchy set of ammunition belts, which when aided with the EEGS for air combat or the CCIP for ground attack, allow this aircraft to make short work of pretty much any tank or plane it faces at closer ranges. Coupled with the advanced avionics, an incredible targeting pod which can further enhance low-visibility targeting over the built-in FLIR camera, and its vast amount of countermeasures, the AV-8B NA is overall a very powerful, jack-of-all-trades aircraft for its battle rating.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The AV-8B (NA) lacks any internal or external armour, and has little chance of survival when encountering a close hit or direct impact of SAM or AAMs. However, VTOL capabilities could help slightly, as it would be easier to land a wounded AV-8B compared to other jets not capable of vertical landing.

As the first generation of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, designated as the AV-8A and the Harrier GR.1, came into use, several drawbacks were revealed including limited combat radius, low payload delivery, lack of ECM (electronic countermeasure) systems, etc. While some problems could be addressed with the installment of improved avionics (resulting in the AV-8C and Harrier GR.3), issues in payload delivery required a redesigned fuselage and engine. Thus, Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas began to develop a more advanced version of the Harrier with a larger fuselage and the Pegasus engine, unofficially dubbed the "AV-16", due to the goals of producing a plane with twice the payload and range of the AV-8. In 1975, however, the RAF pulled out of the project due to budget constraints, and the USMC was unwilling to sponsor the project by itself, resulting in its cancellation in the same year. Since then, McDonnell Douglas began to design a new Harrier based on the existing AV-8A, reconfiguring two AV-8As with redesigned wings, intake, exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes, leading to the YAV-8B. Further tests with YAV-8B regarding payload delivery, range, and VTOL capabilities proved satisfactory, and the AV-8B was officially procured by the USMC as its new generation of VTOL strike aircraft.

In 1985, McDonnell Douglas sought to enhance the all-weather capability of the AV-8B, fitting it with FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) sensors, Hughes AN/ASB-19 ARBS (Angle Rate Bombing System), F-402-RR-408 engine, and an improved HUD and MFD, offering night attack capabilities. Though initially called the AV-8D, this new variant came into service in 1987 designated the AV-8B (NA), or the Harrier Night Attack variant.

The AV-8B saw extensive combat during its long service history. It was first used in Operation Desert Storm where AV-8Bs based on the USS ''Nassau'' and USS ''Tarawa'' supported coalition forces in the Battle of Khafji, dropping guided munitions on Iraqi artillery and provided support for USMC and coalition forces. Later, during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, AV-8Bs were deployed at forward operation bases (FOBs) due to their STOL/VTOL capabilities and had a much faster response time compared to USAF and USN aircraft, which had to take off from airfields in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, or carriers. AV-8Bs carrying LITENING targeting pods flew reconnaissance missions and dropped guided munitions on Al-Qaeda forces and the Iraqi military, flying over 5000 sorties and demolishing a large number of Taliban and Iraqi vehicles and personnel. AV-8Bs also took part in Operation Odyssey Dawn. When a USAF F-15E crashed in Libya due to mechanical failure, both pilots ejected successfully and were stranded deep in enemy territory. Two AV-8Bs dropped 250lb Paveway munition to deter Libyan ground forces from approaching the pilots, and one of the AV-8Bs dropped additional munitions on the wreckage of the F-15E to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. All AV-8B (NA) and AV-8B Plus continue to serve until 2025, by then replaced by newer F-35Bs.
