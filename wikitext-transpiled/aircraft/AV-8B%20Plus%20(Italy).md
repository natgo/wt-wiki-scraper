== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In 1989, Italy's ban on using fixed wing aircraft in naval aviation was finally lifted, and without missing a beat, Italy signed a contract the following year for the purchase of 14 AV-8B+ VTOL fighters and 2 TAV-8B trainers for usage aboard their ''Giuseppe Garibaldi''-class aircraft carrier. The Harrier IIs would form the backbone of Italian naval aviation in the modern era, being modernized for operations aboard the new ''Cavour''-class carrier and soon the upcoming ''Trieste'' carrier, where they will be supplemented in the VTOL strike role by F-35B Lightning II fighters.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], is a modernized version of the venerable [[AV-8A|AV-8 Harrier]], bringing it up to 4th generation fighter standards. The upgrades applied allow this aircraft to not only carry a plethora of new guided ordnance, targeting systems, protective measures, and advanced air-to-air missiles, but also the airframe itself was heavily upgraded over previous AV-8s, with a more powerful engine and large leading edge extensions, allowing the Harrier II to manoeuvre swiftly in ways its predecessors could only imagine.

The AV-8B+ is a incredible all-rounder for the high ranks of Italy, proving to be a decent support fighter in dedicated air battles, but where it truly shines in mixed battles: With the capability to bring up to 10 x laser guided [[GBU-12 Paveway II (277 kg)|GBU-12]] bombs, in addition to a LITENING II thermal pod, a [[GAU-12/U (25 mm)|GAU-12/U]] rotary cannon, and two [[AIM-9M Sidewinder|AIM-9Ms]] for self defence, the AV-8B+ can absolutely decimate ground forces when left unchecked in the airspace above a ground battle. Other ordnance options on the AV-8B+ include up to four [[AGM-65D|AGM-65D Mavericks]] or the larger [[GBU-16 Paveway II (1,092 lb)|GBU-16]] laser guided bombs, or a wide array of various unguided bombs and rockets to choose from. The aircraft also presents itself with many tricks up its sleeve due to being a VTOL: In air engagements, the act of "VIFF"ing, or "Vector In Forward Flight" allows the Harrier II to quickly force an opponent to overshoot while also tightening its own turning circle through the use of VTOL thrust vectoring. In ground battles, while a risky manoeuvre with a lot of preparation required, it is possible to use the AV-8B+ similarly to a helicopter: by hovering behind terrain cover and only popping out occasionally to launch a fire-and-forget AGM-65D Maverick missile at unsuspecting tanks.

=== Pros and cons ===

'''Pros:'''

* Great payload options, access to a very diverse range of ground attack ordnance which include laser-guided bombs and missiles
* Has access to VTOL, can be used to capture enemy points or even hide the aircraft when engaging enemies
* Can sustain long dogfights with its decent energy retention
* Has built-in target tracker and FLIR even without targeting pod
* Has Pilot NVD

'''Cons:'''

* Relatively slow top speed compared to other modern aircraft
* Need to be in a light configuration if you want to survive dogfights
* Not very armoured, can't handle being damaged unlike other aircraft

The Italian's Harrier story begins on 1st February 1989. Due to post-war laws, Italy had a very strict guidelines to follow when it came down to its own military forces, these laws would however change shortly after Italy would join NATO. Of these many laws, one would prohibit the Italian Navy from possessing heavily armed aircraft. As such, a new law would be passed known as the "La Legge N.36 del 1 febbraio del 1989 " or "Ali alla Marina" (wings to the Navy) which allowed the Italian Navy to equip itself with armed jets to not only bolster its forces, but mainly to guarantee the security of the Italian Navy and one of its flagships known as the Garibaldi. The Italian Navy was only looking for VTOL/STOL aircraft, so in turn it went for the Harrier, as it fit the role perfectly. Italy was always interested in the Harrier and had even designed a few VTOL/STOL designs of its own, one of the Harrier prototypes was also tested in Italy which likely further pushed the Italian Navy's interest in the platform. This aircraft has been seen being used in multiple countries. Users of the Harrier II include Spain, America and the UK under several different variants. BAE systems had acquired the right to further develop and build the AV-8A that the Americans were already using, so in turn BAE systems had improved it so much such as giving it a better engine. Along other upgrades and changes BAE systems had practically made a new machine which now went under the name of the AV-8B, and also went by the name of "Harrier II". It had access to the latest logistical equipment, and was able to partake in day/night operations.

Due to this, it was the perfect vehicle for the Italian Navy. In September 1990, Italy decided to join the "Plus" program, which aimed to equip the Harriers with radar suites, in which Spain and the US also joined. Italy had bought 18 of the AV-8B, and 2 of the TAV-8B Harrier IIs for training. The Italian government also struck a deal with the United States which allowed Italian Navy pilots to directly train with the Harrier and familiarize themselves with the platform in the US even before they were delivered to Italy. In February 1994, the first Harrier was delivered to the Italian Navy, and by November of that same year, 3 Harriers would call the Garibaldi their new home. Part of the acquisition also allowed Italy to modify their own Harriers (which Alenia would be in charge of). The weapon of choice for the Italian Harriers in terms of air-to-air combat would be the Hughes AIM-120B AMRAAM and the AIM-9L Sidewinder, which at the time were very modern missiles. Italy would also use upgraded variants of those 2 missiles as the years went on. Besides air combat, Italian Navy Harriers were surprisingly well-armed in their air-to-ground configuration, not even the Italian airforce AMX was as heavily armed as the Harrier was during its service. In terms of armament, its main cannon comprised of a GAU-12A 25 mm, something which was already in use with other aircraft of the era. Stand-off capability also included a wide range of laser-guided bombs such as the Paveway series, for anti-tank they had access to the AGM-65 Maverick in 2 different variants. Other optional equipment included unguided rockets and bombs, flare and chaff countermeasures, RWR, and ECM.

Italian Harriers participated in Operation "United Shield" in Somalia, performing multiple recon missions for the American Marines and the Italian "San Marco" regiment. They participated in "Operazione alba neo" in Albania, and had to scramble and intercept multiple jets daily, and in Enduring Freedom where they racked up more than 800 flight hours in combat missions. They also took part with Allied Forces in Kosovo, Operazione Leonte in Lebanon where it was mainly used for monitoring airspace. One of the times it was used as a ground strike aircraft would be in Libya during Operation Unified Protector, and managed to rack up to 1,040 flight hours. Overall, Italian Harriers proved to be a more than useful platform for the Italian Navy, they are soon to be phased out as the Italian Navy begins to put into service their new F-35s.
