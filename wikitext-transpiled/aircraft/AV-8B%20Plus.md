== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Shortly after the Night Attack upgrade program for the AV-8B, which resulted in the [[AV-8B (NA)|AV-8B (Night Attack)]], a further advancement was set out in the AV-8B upgrade program, to be integrated alongside the NA models. This new model, designated the AV-8B "Plus", would work alongside the AV-8B (NA) and be more capable in the air-to-air role. To achieve this, the new AV-8B+ replaced the Hughes AN/ASB-19 FLIR targeting system in the nose with the AN/APG-65 radar, directly taken from older F/A-18 Hornet aircraft which at the time were being upgraded to the new AN/APG-73 radar. This gave the AV-8B+ the capability to fire the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, significantly bolstering its air-to-air capability and, in turn, its ability to defend other friendly Harriers (especially those of the AV-8B (NA) variety) which it would be flying with. Besides this upgrade, there were a few new avionics and FCS changes, primarily giving it the capability to utilise newer variants of the Sidewinder.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]]. Just like its [[AV-8B Plus (Italy)|Italian brother]], the AV-8B+ is a true jack of all trades. The AV-8B+'s only disadvantage lies in its low top speed, being a high-range subsonic aircraft at the battle rating where almost everything it faces is supersonic. However, do not let this deceive you, as the AV-8B+ is capable of dealing back punishment more than it receives, with interest even. Thanks to the smokeless and IRCCM equipped AIM-9M Sidewinder, powerful radar with various modes, the powerful GAU-12 rotary cannon (with EEGS and CCIP) and especially the AIM-120 AMRAAM active radar missile, the AV-8B+ is a very lethal aircraft in any airspace. In addition, when equipped with the capable LITENING II thermal targeting pod, the AV-8B+ also gains the ability to make very lethal use of its arsenal of air-to-ground precision munitions, which can include up to 10 laser-guided bombs or 10 GPS-guided bombs, various types of rockets and bombs, and the AGM-65 Maverick anti-tank guided missile. All in all, the AV-8B+ is a very deadly hoverbug on any battlefield it finds itself in, and is a very easy plane to learn, albeit a hard one to master.
