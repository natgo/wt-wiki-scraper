== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Alpha Jet is a very good CAS plane in ground realistic battles at it's BR. In stock configuration (you need to create a custom weapon preset!), you can precisely use the CCIP to drop 4 bombs and a few rounds of APHE can criple even tanks if you hit from the top, rear or side.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Modern aircraft with SAS, Sight customization and good cockpit visibility, good for SB that are rare skills at his BR
* Very good for CAS, even in stock configuration
* 60 countermeasures
* Very effective gun against vehicles (CCIP, default belt contains 75% APHE)

'''Cons:'''

* No radar or RWR
* No IR missiles for air combat or guided weapons for CAS
* "Air targets" belt only contains 1/4 HE

== History ==

=== [[wt:en/news/8790-development-alpha-jet-a-e-alpha-strike-en|Devblog]] ===
By 1969, both Germany and France had a need for a new generation of jet trainer aircraft to replace their existing inventory of T-33 and Fouga Magister aircraft. It was decided that a collaboration between Dornier and Dassault-Breguet, with the latter first being two separate companies who later merged, had the best potential for a joint TA (Trainer Attack) aircraft over other competing manufacturers and won out the contest with the TA501.

This aircraft was to satisfy the Luftwaffe's need to also replace their G.91 aircraft in the attack role, while the Armée de l'Air's needs were mostly on the training gap that the Anglo-French Jaguar was initially intended to cover, but ended up being a more advanced supersonic conversion / strike aircraft. As such, two distinct versions of what would be the Alpha Jet were formed. The A - Appui / Attack and the E - Ecole / Trainer versions. These would be produced in sub assemblies in Germany, France and also Belgium.

The first prototype would take to the skies in October 1973 and after many more years of testing and trials, the Alpha Jet would enter French and German service in 1979, going on to be a success story of collaboration between nations. While it still serves to this day with France, the aircraft has also been a huge export success, with multiple nations from Belgium, Portugal and Thailand operating the type, as well as it also being popular with private company operators who use them as aggressor training aircraft in the UK, America and Canada.
