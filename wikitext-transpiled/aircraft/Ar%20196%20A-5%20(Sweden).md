== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

This is a version nearly identical to the [[Ar 196 A-3]] found in the German aviation and naval tree (as scout), with the singular upgrade of a significantly more potent rear defensive gun. It will do best in ground combat as the MG FF is effective against ground, plus the two 50 kg bombs for soft ground targets. The seaplane may have additional utility in Air Sim combat that has a water capture point.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Arado Ar 196 A-5 features favourable flight characteristics - it is stable, and a good gun platform. Its flight performance may take enemy fighters off guard, as its turning ability rivals most monoplanes at lower ranks and it can hold its own against even biplanes. However, its weight and drag mean that its energy retention in the vertical is almost non-existent, meaning you'll want to keep your fights strictly horizontal. The aircraft also takes damage very well, able to fight decently even in a critically damaged state. Its speed is reasonable for an aircraft of its type, and its dive performance is favourable for a floatplane, but it will be outrun by essentially all dedicated fighters.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The A-5 has no armour. The survivability though, is fairly average, being able to take a lot of small calibre fire but falling apart fairly quickly under anything higher in calibre than a heavy machine gun. The floats and engine in particular are fairly large targets, and with all of the 196's fuel stored in the floats, you don't want to be taking too much damage to them. The engine is fairly resilient, being able to hold out with large amounts of battle damage and even sustain flight with extreme engine damage, but as with any engine trouble it's paramount to return to base as soon as possible.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|MG FF (20 mm)|MG 17 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 20 mm MG FF cannons, wing-mounted (60 rpg = 120 total)
- 1 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine gun, nose-mounted (500 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|SC50JA (50 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 2 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (100 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|MG 81 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 2 x 7.92 mm MG 81 machine guns, dorsal turret (1,000 rpg = 2,000 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Arado functions well as a support fighter, having good firepower out the back and front. A competent 196 pilot can turn the tide of a dogfight, as its turning ability and powerful weaponry make short work of early war fighters, this is one of the rare planes to mount 20 mm at this BR. The MG 81Z in the observer's position (twin MG 81s) is also a very real threat to enemy aircraft, sporting a very high fire rate with armour piercing and incendiary ammunition. The 196, however, does not have a huge amount of staying power in a fight, as its 20 mm cannons have a fairly average ammunition pool - and once it's depleted the pilot is left with only a single 7.92 mm MG 17. Its flaps, however, are very effective - meaning they drastically reduce the turning radius and have very high rip speeds, which can be used to its advantage during an engagement.

The Ar 196's speed is a limiting factor, as it can only chase down fairly slow aircraft, most of which are bombers or biplanes. It is recommended that you climb to a reasonable altitude, which will allow you to go into engagements with a speed advantage and not leave you stranded at low altitude with very little speed. Armed with only a pair of 50 kg bombs, the Arado does not make a very capable bomber, but it can put them to reasonably good use by taking out some light ground units before engaging enemies in the air.

Its cockpit visibility is reasonably good, with great views out the front and back, though spars somewhat obfuscate the view at both sides, meaning you may have to roll a little from side to side to gain visibility in those areas.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Powerful offensive armament
- Potent defensive armament
- Well defended
- Reasonably rugged
- Great flaps
- Great flight characteristics for an aircraft of its type

'''Cons:'''

- Slow
- Vulnerable to damage to floats
- Poor bomb load
