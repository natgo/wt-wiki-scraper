== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Ar-2 is a pleasant aircraft to fly with a good climb and turn rate, as well as a low stall speed and takeoff requirement.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Ar-2 is quite fast, and is faster than most other bombers at a similar BR (like [[B-18A]] and [[He 111 H-3]]). Use this as an advantage. Go directly for the enemy bases, then go back to the airfield and restart a bombing run. If an enemy plane targets you, keep flying straight and have a slight climb. Use your defensive turrets to scare away enemies tailing you. In Mixed battles, its armament of 3 x 500 kg bombs is quite the loadout for the battle rating and can be used to carpet-bomb a point. However, only spawn in the Ar-2 if there are no enemy fighters up and don't go low altitude- SPAA and roof-mounted MGs will easily chew this plane up.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- It is pretty fast (able to outrun [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109s]])
- The air brakes allows for easy landings (even with critical damage), and excellent diving capabilities
- Excellent mobility for a bomber (expanded further with the use of combat flaps and air brakes)
- Good frontal turret aiming range
- Adequate payload for its speed and mobility (able to take one base and a half when fully loaded)

'''Cons:'''

- Lightly armoured and easily taken down by anything from 20 mm and above
- Prone to flat spins with engine damage or when pushed too far
- Most components are located in the front which makes it easy to destroy in frontal attacks
- Despite the ShKAS machine guns having great belts, they are not very effective against more armoured fighters

== History ==

<!--''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/ History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''-->

The SB-2, the work of aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev, was the one of the world's best bomber when it first flew in 1934. In the Spanish and Chinese battlefields, the SB-2 was so fast that even fighter jets could not catch up. In the late 1930s, the concept of the dive bomber began to appear, and its representative is the famous German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. Luftwaffe operations over Poland in the early years of World War II demonstrated that dive-bombing was highly accurate and effective against small, sturdy targets, and the Red Army did not have such aircraft. Therefore, around 1940, the Soviet Army requested the development of a new dive bomber, SB-RK, based on the existing SB-2.

The Soviets had already done some early work on the dive-bomber. In 1939, TsAGI (Central Aeronautic and Hydrodynamics Research Institute) developed a dive-bomb system named PB-3. The results of conventional SB-2 tests show that the bomb can be dropped into a circle with a radius of 57 m at a height of 2000 m at an angle of 80°. If the projectile is dropped at the same angle from a height of 4,000 meters, it can hit a circle with a radius of 126 meters. After the pilot releases the bomb, the plane will pull up automatically. In order to prevent excessive overload when changing out, overload limiter is also developed. Regardless of the angle, speed, pole position of the aircraft, always maintain the overload at 3G.

In July 1940, the Soviet Union changed the naming rules of aircraft. Instead of naming aircraft according to the service category, it changed to the abbreviation of the designer's surname. After that, the numerical numbers of fighter aircraft were singular, and bombing, attack, transport and reconnaissance aircraft were even. So when the prototype was completed later that year, the SB-RK (hence the "SB-RK" designation where "SB" means "high-speed bomber" and "RK" means "radiators-wing") was renamed AR-2, and it was the only plane in Archangsky's life to bear his family name. However, due to the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, only a small number of AR-2 were produced. Early in the war, a large number of AR-2s were destroyed on runways.

Arkhangelsky Ar-2 (SB-RK) twin-engine front-line dive bomber (Tupolev OKB).

An all-metal, twin-engine monoplane dive bomber with a retractable landing gear system including a tail wheel. Its crew consisted of three persons.

This aircraft was designed under the direction of A. A. Arkhangelsky and was a further structural development of the high-speed SB bomber.

It differed from the SB in its shorter wing and its streamlined, spindle-shaped nose section and modified nacelles, with water-cooled radiators removed from them and placed on the wing (hence the "SB-RK" designation where "SB" means "high-speed bomber" and "RK" means "radiators-wing"). The SB-RK prototype was tested in 1939. Full-scale production of the aircraft designated the Ar-2 started in 1940 at Factory No. 22, in Moscow.

Production Ar-2s were equipped with 1,100 hp Klimov M-105R twelve-cylinder, V-type, geared water-cooled engines.

The plane's defensive armament included an NU nose mount with a 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun with 500 rounds. The machine gun was fitted in a special sphere that enabled it to fire forward within a 50-degree cone-shaped region.

The TSS-1 upper rear machine gun mount ("TSS" standing for "high-speed aircraft turret") had a 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun with 1,000 rounds and a K-8T collimator sight. When firing, the upper canopy (nicknamed the "turtle") was moved back on rollers along rails and partially raised upward to protect the gunner from the incoming flow.

In order to protect the plane from below, the aircraft had a retractable MV-2 turret which housed a 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun with 600 rounds and an OP-2L periscope sight.

The aircraft's standard bomb capacity was 600 kg (carried internally), which was the same as that of the SB, its predecessor, while its maximum bomb capacity could reach 1,500 kg with various combinations of internal and external loads. More advanced NP-1 racks were fitted under the Ar-2's centre wing section to carry bombs weighing 250 or 500 kg. The bombs were fastened in one central holder near the plane's center of gravity, and the plane's hold on them was reinforced with the help of side stops.

The Ar-2 entered service with the Red Army Air Force in the spring of 1940. The plane was in service from the beginning of the war until late 1944, with the units of the Red Army Air Force and Soviet naval aviation, as a dive bomber and a reconnaissance aircraft. The Ar-2's production was discontinued in early 1941. A total of about 200 aircraft were produced.
