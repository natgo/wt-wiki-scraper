== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Aerfer Ariete was a prototype aircraft primarily made for export after the previous design, the [[Sagittario 2]], lost the NATO competition to the [[G.91 (Family)|G.91]]. Aerfer would further improve the design by giving it a new engine, but otherwise remained largely similar to the original design, making it one of the most manoeuvrable aircraft of the time. However, it was also not chosen; the Aerfer Ariete would no longer be offered for export as the Aerfer company began to work on its next aircraft, known as the Aerfer Leone.

Introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]], the Aerfer Ariete is a further development of the Aerfer [[Sagittario 2]]. The aircraft is one of the most nimble and dogfight-friendly jets in the Italian tree. Similar to the Sagittario 2, it has great handling and two fast-firing cannons which can easily destroy any aircraft unlucky enough to be hit by them. However, it is equipped with an additional engine which, while rather weak on its own, provides a nice boost to the Ariete's flight capabilities. Similar to the Sagittario, it does not have a lot of fuel, so it cannot stay in the air for too long. Players may therefore not want to overextend when playing the aircraft.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Aerfer Ariete has incredible manoeuvrability, at its battle rating and even above it, there won't be many aircraft that can match you in terms of how responsive the aircraft is. Whilst playing the Aerfer Ariete, you are able to do amazing manoeuvres that the enemy team could only dream of doing. Due to this, an experienced player in this aircraft can become quite a dangerous opponent. The max altitude of the Aerfer Ariete is 12,000 metres, thanks to its rate of climb, you should be able to reach a good altitude at the beginning of the match with minimal effort required. In a dogfight, the Ariete can typically pull 12G, and in extreme cases, up to 15G. This makes up for the less than desirable roll rate and allows you to quickly reverse dogfights in the two-circle and one-circle. Its secondary engine (in the tail) shuts down below 110% throttle, so you can conserve fuel and slow down quickly in turn fights, then regain energy quickly when the time comes. You can see this in game, at 100% throttle, the small scoop just before the vertical stabilizer will retract to be flush with the fuselage, and the OIL2 and ENGN2 values will begin decreasing until you go back to 110%.

Using the Aerfer Ariete is quite straightforward, it's an aircraft that nearly anyone can pick up and do fairly well in. It plays basically like a better [[Sagittario 2]] so a lot of how to use this vehicle remains the same. The Aerfer Ariete will be one of the top dogs when it comes to dogfighting, this is mainly due to its amazing flight performance, which when compared with the majority of aircraft it'll face in a downtier, make this vehicle quite fun to use. The best way to play the Aerfer Ariete is to climb to an average altitude of around 3,500-4,000 metres at a 10° angle to make sure that you have some spare speed, and engage with any somewhat isolated enemy you can encounter. This is highly effective mainly due to the powerful 30 mm HS 825 cannons that the Ariete has access to. This plane is really good dogfighter so you are able to perform quite a lot of manoeuvres that many aircraft are not able to pull off. Make sure you consider that during engagements, especially because the aircraft can easily pull G's without too much punishment towards the player controlling it. However, you should be careful to not get caught in a furball or doing sustained turns as your plane bleeds a higher amount of speed during turns than your enemies, However if you have a pack of enemies behind you, and you're flying at a good speed (650 km/h or more), you can pull hard to evade all of them and try to fight back. Keep in mind, if you want to take advantage of its speed and manoeuvrability, you will have to keep the aircraft as light as possible, meaning bringing the minimal amount of fuel. This may seem like a disadvantage to some, but it's likely the most effective way to get eliminations with the vehicle as it allows the aircraft to remain fast and nimble. Do keep in mind that if you decide not to bring a lot of fuel, you won't be in the battle as long, so make sure to make every second count.

Another thing that people may claim is a disadvantage is the low ammo count; although this is somewhat true, doesn't mean the vehicle suffers. The HS 825 cannons are extremely deadly, they have a very high muzzle velocity (About 1000 m/s), and paired up with the hard-hitting 30 mm HE calibre, means that the majority of enemy aircraft you'll face will be destroyed after a small barrage of your main weapon. The Aerfer Ariete can also work at low altitude as an AI ground pounder, the main cannons it has access to are just as effective at taking out ground AI targets as they are at taking down air targets. This can be very effective as you can easily take advantage of your speed at the beginning of the match to slip past undetected by enemy aircraft. You could also use this to surprise enemies by flanking them once they've flown past you, unaware that you're actually able to go behind them. This is especially useful against A-10's and A-6E's you may face, as well as SU-25's as they will almost always engage you with all-aspect AAM's. If you stick close to the ground, you can come up from below and quickly glue yourself to their tail, and with enough awareness, you can juggle a dogfight between several opponents at once. Just be careful to watch your ammo counts, as the higher armoured planes (previously mentioned) tend to tank your shots if placed badly (wingtips, elevators, fuselage). When behind one of these vehicles, try to go for the base of the wings, the center of the elevators/rudder, or a clean pilot snipe. Planes like the MiG-19, MiG-17, and F-104 can put up a fight, but if you use your extraordinary climb rate, energy conservation, and turn time, again, you can easily reverse any fight.

The Aerfer Ariete does not have access to any countermeasures so keep that in mind if you choose to bring it in air or ground RB. Its cannons are enough to easily make make short work for the majority of lightly armoured ground vehicles, such as IFVs and SPAAs. One thing you will need to be aware of is the fact the the Aerfer Ariete will face enemy aircraft armed with missiles, if you get caught off-guard you will become easy prey for enemies far away from you. To make the most out the the aircraft, only engage when in close proximity. Considering it doesn't have any payload options such as rockets or bombs, you'll have to entirely rely on your main cannons, and that also goes for air vehicles, as you don't have access to air-to-air missiles. It is not recommended to land on short runways, it should be avoided or risk crashing at the end. This also applies for Arcade battles. Overall in the Aerfer Ariete try at all times to take advantage of your abilities, as it's the best way to come on top in duels, and win the match.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The second engine provides about 50% more thrust than the Sagittario 2
* The high fire rate and velocity of the 30 mm Hispano's can make quick work of any aircraft or light ground target
* The high velocity of the 30 mm Hispano is easy to use and beginner friendly
* Extremely effective aircraft control even at high speed
* Quick acceleration for a jet without an afterburner

'''Cons:'''

* The second engine will burn off fuel faster if used
* Only a high explosive belt can be used
* A low ammo count of 240 rounds paired with a quick fire rate means trigger discipline is a must
* No suspended armament
* Large possibility of facing many supersonic jets
* Has a heavier airframe than the Sagittario 2 due to the second engine
* Requires high level pilot to handle high G turns and avoid constant blackout
* No Counter Measures, while most of the time facing IR and all aspect missiles
* Unfortunate BR which all but guarantees full uptiers, where dog fighting ability is trumped by good IR missiles

The story of the Aerfer Ariete began roughly around the 1950s during the Cold War. The aircraft would be completely designed by Sergio Stefanutti, who was one of the most original and innovative Italian aeronautical designers. In fact, in 1939, he produced the S.S.4 that was the first fighter in the world to fly with canard lifting surfaces and forward landing gear. During the Second World War he was involved in the construction of the "Light fighter", fast and well-armed, which was able to compete with those in its class, equal in weight, dimensions and even greater in power, but which couldn't be mass-produced because of the unfavourable conclusion of the conflict. His work as a designer also continued into the 1940s and 1950s, when, despite the destruction of the war, the Italian aviation industry was still showing its strength, proposing numerous new types of aircraft for both the internal and international market.

Eventually, he'd come up with the Aerfer "Sagittario II" (Sagittarius II), the light jet fighter with swept wings. It was the first Italian supersonic jet fighter, designed and produced at the beginning of the 1950s by Sergio Stefanutti and was a logical development on the light fighters previously built for SAI Ambrosini. The Sagittario 2 was actually a development of previous Stefanutti designs, originally based of a pre-war piston-engine aircraft meant for racing.

Eventually, after a few shortcomings which included some issues with the jet engine, the Sagittario was born. There were a lot of advancements made during the development of the Sagittario, but sadly whilst conducting tests, it was quickly learned about certain defects of the aircraft, one of them being discovered after landing.

In 1958, the Aerfer Ariete would first appear, it would be a further development of the Sagittario 2, one of the main differences would be the modified fuselage to allow for a new engine to be installed on top of the previous one. The main reasoning for this aircraft to be made was to bring the Sagittario 2 to industry standards for subsequent mass production and to hopefully make a useful fighter aircraft in the eyes of several airforces around the world. It would keep the same the dual 30 mm Hispano-Suiza 825 cannons. It would hold up to 120 rounds per cannon, they fired bullets that were 113 mm long and 30 mm in diameter. The bullets had a total weight of 360 grams. The reason the cannons would actually be as powerful as they were was due to the ammunition being 40% larger than the bullets of the same calibre used by the other small Western cannons then in production. As an example, the French DEFA used a 275 gram bullet, and the British Aden used 220 gram bullet. For suspended armament it kept the same options that the Sagittario had: conventional bombs, napalm, and unguided rockets would all be part of its arsenal.

The prototype would be built at the Aerfer plant in Pomigliano d'Arco, near Naples. On the 27th of March 1958 at the Experimental Flight Department, with registration number MM 568, the Aerfer Ariete would undergo its first test flight in Pratica di Mare. It did show some good qualities, however the results gained from the various tests conducted did prove that for an aircraft of that era, it would not be up to standards. Following this revelation, the Italian Air Force would renounce any acquisition of the aircraft and therefore remained a sole prototype. Following the Aerfer Ariete, the Aerfer Leone would be designed which would aim to improve and actually bring the aircraft to match the specification needs from the Italian airforce, sadly it would not be completed and the project would end there, marking likely the last proper attempt from Aerfer in making a jet for the Italian airforce.
