The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

The A-4N Ayit is the most advanced version of the A-4 Skyhawk currently featured in War Thunder. Historically, it is a derivative of the A-4M Skyhawk operated by the United States Marine Corps. The appearance is nothing special, having the dorsal hump of the premium [[A-4E (Israel)|Israeli A-4E]] and the crooked refueling probe of the previous [[A-4E Early (M) (Israel)|A-4E Early (M)]] in the tech tree. Under the hood, it has a more powerful engine and a large arsenal. It can equip dangerous infrared missiles for air combat and has early access to AGM-65A Maverick air-to-ground missiles for tank busting, easily outranging most anti-air systems at its battle rating.

Although it can be considered the ultimate Skyhawk, the Ayit's battle rating will pit it against supersonic jets with far superior performance, even when not carrying heavy ordnance. Thus, it should be flown opportunistically, avoiding direct air-to-air fights when possible and waiting for good moments to fire missiles at distracted jets or unload bombs onto ground targets.

Ayit's arsenal is upgraded compared to the previous Israeli A-4E. Plenty of unguided bombs and rockets are available as usual, and the ballistic computer now offers CCIP on top of the existing CCRP capability. However it still lacks CCIP for rockets, so the Ayit is not a first-rate rocket sled despite having a large capacity for rocket pods.

Two options are available for air-to-air ordnance, the domestic Shafrir 2 missile and the American AIM-9D, much improved over the A-4E's AIM-9B Sidewinders. Both have overloads of 18 G, which is very good for its battle rating, and enemies will need to put significant effort into dodging them kinetically. The AIM-9D has a better seeker and more range compared to the Shafrir at the cost of a smaller warhead and is the best option overall.

In terms of guided air-to-ground ordnance, there are four options. MCLOS Bullpup AGMs and TV-guided Walleye and GBU-8 guided bombs return from the A-4E and can still cause plenty of pain to ground targets in Ground RB. The new option is a triple rack of AGM-65 Maverick TV-guided AGMs mounted on the center pylon, and this one of the selling point of the Ayit. Mavericks are fast, pack a big punch against contemporary tanks, and leave the wing hardpoints free for air-to-air missiles or Walleyes while having three times the capacity of a single GBU-8 occupying the same spot.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Ayit can be used in a multitude of roles such as a fighter, bomber, or ground attacker due to its variety of armaments and good performance.

'''Fighter'''

Players that plan to use it as a fighter will not be disappointed by its air-to-air armament. Mounted with 2 x 30 mm DEFA cannons, gun kills will be quick and simple, but users should be aware of the DEFA's limited range. There is also an option for up to three 20 mm gunpods which can be mounted on either wing and/or centreline of the aircraft. The wing-mounted gunpods will take up valuable missile slots, so players who wish for a bit more firepower against aircraft should equip only the center-line gunpod. The Ayit has access to two different air-to-air missiles, the [[Shafrir 2]] and the [[AIM-9D]]. Both missiles are very good for the battle rating and the best loadout will be the 2x Shafrir 2 and 2x AIM-9D. Shafrir 2's should be used for close range and slower targets as these missiles can be kinematically evaded by manoeuvrable fighters like the [[MiG-17]] or [[MiG-19 (Family)|MiG-19]]. Shafrir 2's also have an uncaged seeker which can be utilized for leading the missile which helps in close-range launches. On the other hand, the AIM-9D does not have an uncaged seeker which is a detriment in close-range launches but the missile can hit longer-range targets and is incredibly hard to kinematically evade. For the best performance against aircraft, players should choose the low-fuel option to reduce the chance of overloading the wings and to stay light as possible. The Ayit also has countermeasures so missiles like the [[AIM-9G]] and [[R-60]] can be easily evaded. Because of its strong engine, the Ayit can accelerate very well. However, due to the delta wing design, it will quickly lose energy with extensive turning so players should be wary of getting into prolonged fights.

'''Attacker/Bomber'''

For ground attacks and bombing, the Ayit has a lot of options. From air-to-ground missiles, guided bombs, and regular dumb bombs and rockets, players can equip a variety of weapons with custom loadouts. The dumb bombs have CCIP/CCRP which will allow for accurate drops but the rockets do not have CCIP. The cannons also have no CCIP. For bombing, the dumb bombs will give the most tonnage but the [[BLU-27/B incendiary|BLU-27]] incendiary bombs can also be used to take out bases. Players who plan to ground attack in Air RB should note the map before spawning in. Some maps (City) have simple models for ground vehicles which can easily be taken out by either the 30 mm or 20 mm cannon. However, many new maps (Sinai, Vietnam, etc) have detailed ground vehicles that will require more than just cannons to take out. For those targets, the best option would be to use guided weaponry, dumb bombs, or rockets if one is accustomed to using them. Against stationary ground targets like AA or light pillboxes, the cannons will easily destroy them.

'''Common Enemies'''

The [[F-104A]] is a common foe for the Ayit. It is the same battle rating in realistic battles as the Ayit and is a popular plane due to its immense speed. However, the F-104A struggles with manoeuvrability, so Ayit users can reverse a Starfighter and quickly get on their six for a quick window to get a missile off. If an Ayit user is unable to fire a missile off then it will be best to go back to level flight and try to run to a friendly or wait for another reversal attempt. This same process applies to many other flareless supersonic fighters like the [[MiG-21F-13|MiG-21F]]/[[MiG-21S (R-13-300)|S]] and [[MiG-19_(Family)|MiG-19]]. Unlike the Starfighter, both of these planes are more manoeuvrable and can be a bit more difficult to get a reversal done. As for subsonic jets like the [[F-86F-2]] or [[MiG-17]], the Ayit can use its quick acceleration and top speed to run away or get into a better position for a dogfight. Reversals can also be done against these targets due to the Ayit's ability to quickly bleed energy but these should not be performed with multiple enemies around. It will also be much more difficult to do this manoeuvre since subsonic aircraft will have a far lower closure rate compared to supersonic jets. The Ayit will also struggle in vertical fights due to how quickly it will lose energy compared to planes like the MiG-17. Players should try and avoid these types of fights whenever possible.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has access to a large variety of mixed loadouts, including AGM-65 Mavericks
* Has the strongest engine among all Skyhawks in-game which allows it to accelerate very well
* Can carry the long range AIM-9D when most aircraft it faces have only AIM-9B or equivalent missiles
* Hard-hitting DEFA 553 cannons with a lot of ammunition
* Excellent roll rate and turn rate
* Has access to RWR, flares, and chaff
* Has a tough airframe that can take a surprising amount of punishment for its size and weight

'''Cons:'''

* Wings tend to rip easily during High-G turns
* No CCIP for the gun or for rockets
* DEFA 553 cannons have rather low muzzle velocity, which makes it harder to aim than most guns
* Aircraft performance can become unresponsive when carrying heavy loadouts
* Very average top speed which quickly becomes outclassed in uptiers

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

In the years between 1972 and 1976, Israel received 117 upgraded A-4Ms called the A-4N. The A-4N ("Ayit" which means eagle) received many updated avionics over the standard A-4M while retaining the J52-P-408 engine. These updates included new computers, a heads-up display, a mapping, and range radar (AN/APQ-145), ECM homing and warning receiver (AN/APR-36/37), and more. The A-4N also received 2 DEFA 30 mm cannons, unlike the A-4M which had 2 20 millimeter cannons. In addition, the cockpit was revised for better visibility.

In 1968, Israel launched a program to upgrade the Super Mystere with the Pratt & Whitney J52 to replace the original Atar 101. This program was launched in order to make the Super Mystere more similar to the A-4 Skyhawks Israel had at the time which also had the J52. In order to fit the J52, major structural redesigns were needed and one of these changes included an extension of the tailpipe. During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, a year after Israel started receiving A-4Ns, Israeli officials noticed that although the upgraded Super Mysteres and A-4Ns flew almost the exact same type of missions and faced the same type of enemies, fewer Super Mysteres were being lost to missiles than the A-4Ns. Further analysis proved that the extension of the tailpipe from the upgraded Super Mystere moved the missile's detonation further away from the aircraft, thus leading to less damage and a lower loss rate. The A-4N was recommended to receive a similar type of tailpipe which is why A-4Ns after 1973 have an extended tailpipe. Israel continued using the A-4N until it was fully retired in 2015, 43 years after it was introduced into service.

A few A-4Ns were acquired by Top Aces and Draken International. Draken International, a US-based company, provided training for the Air National Guard with their acquired A-4Ns. Top Aces has used A-4Ns for training the Canadian, Australian, and German armed forces.
