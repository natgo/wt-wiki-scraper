== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has access to a large variety of mixed loadouts, including AGM-65 Mavericks
* Has the strongest engine among all Skyhawks in-game which allows it to accelerate very well
* Can carry the long range AIM-9D when most aircraft it faces have only AIM-9B or equivalent missiles
* Hard-hitting DEFA 553 cannons with a lot of ammunition
* Excellent roll rate and turn rate
* Has access to RWR, flares, and chaff
* Has a tough airframe that can take a surprising amount of punishment for its size and weight

'''Cons:'''

* Wings tend to rip easily during High-G turns
* No CCIP for the gun or for rockets
* DEFA 553 cannons have rather low muzzle velocity, which makes it harder to aim than most guns
* Aircraft performance can become unresponsive when carrying heavy loadouts
* Very average top speed which quickly becomes outclassed in uptiers

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
