== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

This particular version of the B-17, designated the B-17G, is the main serial production variant of the famous "Flying Fortress". Changes of the G model include a pressurised cabin, the addition of two ventral turrets at the nose and middle section, improved engines, and increased protection for the tail gunner.

The B-17G Flying Fortress, as the name suggests, is intended to be used as a high-altitude level bomber, designed to target enemy airfields and military bases. Despite its large bomb-load, it is not recommended to target moving ground targets such as tank formations. This due to the inaccuracy of bombs being released at high altitude. When using the B-17G, it is always best to group up with others in a wedge-like formation for optimal defence. The higher you climb the harder of a target you will become. A few fighter escorts, such as a squadron of [[P-51D-5|P-51 Mustangs]] would ensure the survival of friendly bombers. Survival is of the utmost importance to be remembered when using this plane. While you may miss one target, you can always make another pass once you reload and repair.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
As with earlier B-17 models, the B-17G's flight performance is nothing to write home about. The plane is quite slow to move around at higher speeds and suffers from excessive wing loading that prevents it from doing most aerobatic manoeuvres outside of Arcade mode. While the B-17G's top speed is decent for a heavy bomber, it is still quite slow compared to other fighters at its BR, which means the B-17G will not outrun any fighters or interceptors unless it has an altitude advantage.

Speaking about altitude, the B-17G gets a long range bomber spawn. When combined with the plane's improved higher altitude performance, the B-17G can climb up to a safer altitude from most fighters except some dedicated interceptors, thus allowing the B-17G to reach its target and safely drop its payload as long as the plane is not spotted.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 6.35 mm Steel - Lower nose armour plate
* 6.35 mm Steel - Back of pilot and co-pilot's seats
* 6.35 mm Steel - Dorsal turret gunner protective plate
* 6.35 mm Steel - Radio operator protective plate
* 6.35 mm Steel - Beam gunner protective armour x 2
* 6.35 mm Steel - Tail gunner protective plate
* 38 mm Bulletproof glass - Ball turret
* 38 mm Bulletproof glass - Tail gunner rear window

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

This slow and lumbering heavy bomber relies entirely on its turrets for defence. Without it, the plane is target practice. Thus "Protective vests" should be the first unlock. Further survivability upgrades will make the fight easier, but do not think it will successfully face-off against enemy fighters. So upgrading the bomb payloads should be second priority. Performance modules can be considered the least necessary.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)|AN-M66A2 (2,000 lb)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 8 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (4,000 lb total)
* 12 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (6,000 lb total)
* 6 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (6,000 lb total)
* 2 x 2,000 lb AN-M66A2 bombs (4,000 lb total)
* 8 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (8,000 lb total)
* 4 x 2,000 lb AN-M66A2 bombs (8,000 lb total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, chin turret (400 rpg = 800 total)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 2 x cheek turrets (300 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, front dorsal turret (500 rpg = 1,000 total)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, rear dorsal turret (500 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, ventral turret (500 rpg = 1,000 total)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (600 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, tail turret (575 rpg = 1,150 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
When facing fighters and interceptors in Realistic Battles, it is best to use Omni-purpose or Armour-piercing/Ground Target ammunition belts for the 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns. These ammunition belts are effective at tearing through the engine block and hopefully resulting in an internal engine fire. You may be also able to score a pilot kill on your opponent.

====Specific enemies worth noting====
<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->
B-17s are notoriously hard to kill when compared to similar Soviet and German bombers. However, with the B-17 the best defence is to evade your opponent altogether. Your worst enemies will be almost all fighters due to the high BR (Fw 190 D, Ta-152, BF-109 G-10/K-4, F8F-1B, Tempest, etc.). Most fighters will have 2-4 cannons which can still make short work of the B-17.
[[File:BomberImage_Boeing_B-17G_2_BG_dropping_bombs.jpg|200px|thumb|right|B-17G dropping bombs in Europe]]
The weakest area of approach with the B-17G is the front. Only 1-2 MGs can be focused directly forward if a fighter head-ons you. The crew is also focused at the nose. If there is a fighter at your level, try to turn and expose the tail "barb". Diving may work as well. However, diving can put you into more danger as more fighters may swarm you.

====Counter-tactics====
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->
When climbing to fight the B-17, you will most likely have a lower energy level depending on the plane you use. The F8F-1B, for example, has extremely good acceleration with WEP and can climb ridiculously quickly as well. If in a plane such as an F8F-1B, attempt to head on the B-17 as this is the weakest point. If the B-17 turns away, climb and chase the Flying Fortress at a higher altitude and then dive on it from an angle. Always avoid tailing a B-17, regardless of model. This just warrants a knocked-out pilot or fire.

'''Pros:'''

* Large bomb payload
* Powerful air defence capabilities, with effectively no blindspots
* Multiple powerful engines increase the plane's endurance
* Decent climb rate for a bomber at higher altitudes
* Overall heavily armoured

'''Cons:'''
* Fairly slow compared to other aircraft at its rank
* Big target, its huge wings and tail were vulnerable against 20 mm cannons
* Nose is extremely vulnerable for the pilot and crew
* Prone to fire damage
* Excessive wing loading can cause the wings to rip while turning at higher speed (~400 km/h)

Due to direct experience from U.S. bomber crews in 1943, the B-17F revealed inadequate protection from head-on attacks by enemy fighters. To remedy this problem, a remote-controlled chin turret armed with two 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns was introduced on the final production block of Douglas-built B-17Fs, the B-17F-75-DL. This turret became standard on the B-17G, and proved to be more practical than manually operated guns initially fitted to the nose. The B-17G began delivery in September of 1943 and included various upgrades throughout its production. A total of 8,680 aircraft were built from three manufacturers until April of 1945. The B-17G could be considered the cornerstone of U.S. bombing efforts in the European theatre between 1944 and 1945.

The Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress was the first American all-metal heavy bomber. The plane was designed in 1934 in response to a design competition for a coastal anti-ship bomber. A year later the Boeing-299 prototype was built, equipped with four 750-HP Pratt & Whitney engines. It was first flown on June 28 of that year. Subsequent variants used the 1,200 HP Wright Cyclone engines. Boeing factories began mass producing B-17 Flying Fortresses for the US Army Air Corps exactly 12 months later. Throughout the production run, Boeing produced 6,981 B-17s of various variants and an additional 5,745 were built by Lockheed and Douglas giving a total of 12,726 aircraft.

The B-17 quickly became legendary due to its ability to withstand battle damage and to bring hole-ridden aircraft home safely. Nine, and later twelve, Browning .50-cal machine guns offered formidable defensive fire coverage. Nevertheless, the aircraft was not without its faults. For example, the tendency to catch fire was never overcome. Another weakness was the lack of protection against head-on attacks; out of 27 pieces of armour, none protected the crew from the front. Firing a cannon or even a machine gun at the cockpit would find the crew completely unprotected. Another famous part of the B-17 was its highly advanced Norden bombsight, which allowed for effective bomb aiming even at high altitudes.
