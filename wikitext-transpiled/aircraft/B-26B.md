== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 12.7 mm steel - floor and port side of nose gunner/bombardier's position
* 8 mm steel - slightly curved armour plates behind flight deck seats (pilot, copilot, plus one unoccupied position that is presumably the navigator/radio operator's position)
* 9 mm steel - under main oil coolers in each engine nacelle
* 12.7 mm steel - under beam gunner
* 12.7 mm steel - two curved plates aft of dorsal turret
* 12.7 mm steel - aft of tail gunner
* 8 mm bulletproof glass - small window for tail gunner

There is basically no protection from the front for the flight crew, so while your offensive battery of five forward-firing M2 Brownings might make head-on attacks tempting, your pilots are shockingly vulnerable from that angle.

The four large self-sealing fuel tanks in the wings are relatively easy targets for enemy fighters, and your engines are also an easy target. To make matters worse, the B-26 had a reputation for being very challenging to keep in the air with only one engine. While the Marauder is often able to absorb a considerable amount of punishment, it is unlikely you'll make it alive back to base. Use your speed to keep pursuing fighters on your tail, where your relatively well protected defensive gunners can discourage pursuit.

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, nose turret (270 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, dorsal turret (400 rpg = 800 total)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (240 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, tail turret (800 rpg = 1,600 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The B-26 is best used at high altitudes to avoid combat as much as possible due to lack of armour, its size, and because most bombers go out solo, leaving you no other allies to help you. Be sure to use its speed to your advantage. Some notable enemies that should be avoided at all costs are aircraft like the Do 335: its absurd amount of guns can surely rip you in half with nearly a burst or two. If you can dodge any enemies that come your way, then it's a cakewalk when taking out bases.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fighter planes will have trouble once you hit your max speed at your correct altitude
* Anti-tank bombs (AKA armour-piercing bombs) are good for CAS uses
* The 30x payload is good for strips of AAA and armoured cars
* Offensive armament is good for taking out enemy bombers
* Guns rarely jam when upgraded

'''Cons:'''

* The nose gunner isn't really reliable
* One bomb load can really take care of one base
* The front guns need to be angled up to be used

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Martin B-26 medium bomber was submitted by the Glenn L. Martin company in 1939 to the same USAAC specification (Circular Proposal 39-640) as the North American B-25 Mitchell, and both were accepted off the drawing board. Unsurprisingly, the two airplanes share much in common: twin-engined medium bombers, similar in size, with similar offensive and defensive armament. Both saw service in all major theaters of the war, with both U.S. and allied forces.

What sets the B-26 Marauder apart is that it was designed for speed; designed around two massively powerful Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engines, its maximum speed is a full 10% faster than its slightly smaller and lighter B-25 counterpart. However, this speed came at a cost. With high wing loading and demanding flight characteristics, the B-26 was noticeably harder to fly than the Mitchell. This pilot skill differential, combined with the pressures of wartime training, led to a track record of deadly crashes early in the plane's history, gaining a reputation as a "widow maker".

Despite this unpromising start to its career, the B-26 Marauder racked up a solid combat record. Mostly deployed at medium altitude missions, it became known for accurate bombing, and by the end of the war, the U.S. 9th Air Force reported that the so-called "widow maker" recorded the lowest combat loss rate of any aircraft type.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_B-26_Marauder</ref> One B-26, named "Flak Bait", survived over 200 missions and is on display at the Smithsonian Institution's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak-Bait</ref>

Although most of its combat flying was done in the European Theater of Operations, a notable early engagement in the Pacific was the sortie of four torpedo-equipped Marauders against the Japanese fleet during the Battle of Midway. None of the torpedoes hit, two of the planes were lost, and the other two returned so badly shot-up that they were written off. Over the fleet and pursued by Japanese A6M Zeroes, a B-26 named "Susie Q" actually overflew the length of the Akagi's flight deck at very low level, strafing the deck crew with its machine guns. Susie Q landed, just barely, back at Midway with over 500 bullet holes.<ref>https://www.pacificwar.org.au/Midway/USArmy_at_Midway.html</ref>

The in-game version represents the B-26B model after some modifications had been made, including lengthening the wings to improve (but not eliminate) the tricky handling characteristics. Most B-26 were built at the Glenn L. Martin plant in Baltimore, Maryland, but the essentially identical B-26C (found in the French tech tree) was built in Omaha, Nebraska. A total of 5,288 aircraft of all models were built between 1941 and 1945.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_B-26_Marauder</ref>
