== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

This version of the B-26 Marauder under French service, designated as the B-26C, is virtually the same as the [[B-26B]] found in the American tech tree, save for the livery. The different designations were intended to distinguish the batch of extended wing B-26 variants that were produced in Omaha, Nebraska instead of Baltimore, Maryland.

Compared to the previous French bombers, the Marauder serves as a "middle ground" between a massive, high-flying bomber like the [[N.C.223.3]] and various fast but lightly armed bombers like [[LeO 451 early|LeO 451]]. The plane is quite sluggish for a medium bomber, but featuring protection and payload closer to that of a heavy bomber. This allows the Marauder to either be used for bombing bases, attacking columns of vehicles, or providing close air support in ground and naval battles with great efficiency.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
As expected from a medium-to-large bomber, the B-26C Marauder's flight characteristics are quite similar to its predecessor, the [[B-25J-20|B-25 Mitchell]], being generally sluggish to handle but with decent flatline speed. Though due to its bigger size and weight, the general weakness found the B-25's flight performance is further exacerbated. The Marauder will lose quite a lot of energy when making any manoeuvres, especially in vertical manoeuvres that will almost always result in a stall if the plane did not have enough energy prior to the movement. This poor energy retention also results in the plane having very poor climb rate, even when compared to heavy bombers. The plane's control surface lock up when exceeding 540 km/h, and the wings will break if exceeding 580 km/h.

On the bright side, the Marauder's engines provide enough power to accelerate in shallow dives and allows the plane to reach the target faster. This also helps in emergency cases as the Marauder is also capable of flying with one engine in case the other is knocked out.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
As with other American medium bombers, the B-26C is fairly survivable. The plane features multiple layers of armour protecting the pilot and gunners; combined with a sturdy airframe, this allows the plane to tank quite a lot of hits, especially from machine guns.

The two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 "Twin Wasp" engines provide an additional failsafe to the plane, as it allows the pilot to fly with one engine knocked out and limp back to the base for repair.

However, being larger than the B-25 and with less effective frontal armament, the B-26C is quite prone to pilot snipes from frontal engagements. As such, avoid diving head-first into the enemy at all costs.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Since the stock payload is as potent as the 600 lb bomb payload, B-26C pilots have more freedom when it comes to choosing an upgrade. Though an additional payload unlock is recommended, as the 600 lb payload is a rank 2 modification which allows you to unlock rank 3 modification faster, and the payload is generally easier to use.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, nose-mounted (200 rpg)
* 4 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, cheek-mounted (250 rpg upper + 200 rpg lower = 900 total)

The B-26C features five .50 cal Browning machine guns mounted on the nose and cheeks as its offensive armament. These guns were mounted with the intent of being used to strafe ground targets, which the Marauder is perfectly capable of doing. However, unlike the B-25, due to the guns being mounted quite low on the fuselage and being placed quite far apart, this results in the guns having poor convergence and thus are very hard to aim at an enemy plane. This is not helped by the fact that the plane has much worse handling than the B-25 and that its large tail directly blocks the aiming point. Because of this, it is better used against ground targets or slow-flying AI planes instead.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M30A1 (100 lb)|H.E. M31 (300 lb)|H.E. M32 (600 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)|AN-M66A2 (2,000 lb)}}
{{main|Mk.13-6 (2,216 lb)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 30 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs (3,000 lb total)
* 14 x 300 lb H.E. M31 bombs (4,200 lb total)
* 8 x 600 lb H.E. M32 bombs (4,800 lb total)
* 4 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (4,000 lb total)
* 2 x 2,000 lb AN-M66A2 bombs (4,000 lb total)
* 1 x 2,216 lb Mk.13-6 torpedo

The B-26C features a large payload for its type. The stock payload of 30 x 100 lb bombs are actually quite potent, being able to take out two bases in downtier and one in uptier, though due to the bomb series set up, the payload often requires micromanagement to precisely manage the drop. Due to the quantity, the 100 lb payload are very useful against columns of vehicles. The most "optimal" payload against bases in air battles is the 8 x 600 lb bombs, which can destroy the same number of bases as the 100 lb bombs, but are much easier to handle.

Other than the smaller bombs, the Marauder also has an access to large bombs to tackle ground and naval targets. The plane has an access to 4 x 1,000 lb or 2 x 2,000 lb bombs to provide destructive CAS against the enemy team.

The Marauder also has an option to mount a single Mk.13 torpedo. However, only the notoriously terrible, early version of the Mk. 13 is available, with very poor drop speed and range. This, combined with the plane's large size, means that the Marauder pilot should rely on its large bombs against enemy ships instead.

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, nose turret (270 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, dorsal turret (400 rpg = 800 total)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (240 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, tail turret (800 rpg = 1,600 total)

For defensive purposes, the B-26C features seven .50 cal Browning machine guns, with noticeable focus on the tail: all but one of these guns can be directed behind the plane, as the Marauder were designed to outrun the opponent rather than confront them. As such, the Marauder features strong defensive firepower at the rear but mostly lacks any self-defense measures anywhere else. This can be exploited by enemy pilots by engaging either at the poorly-protected front or the blind spot at the side and belly of the aircraft. Because of this, B-26C pilots should attempt to face their tail at any chaser if possible to have more chance of surviving.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Being essentially an upsized B-25, the B-26C Marauder excels at fast bombing using its speed to quickly reach a target. However, due to the Marauder being significantly larger, the plane has several limitations that prevents it from being played aggressively like its predecessor. As such, the playstyle of the B-26 is somewhat similar to other medium bombers: quickly approaching the target, drop the bomb, and then retreat.

Due to the frontally-mounted MGs, the Marauder can be used to strafe soft targets when the payload is used up. Though due to the plane's generally poor flight performance, be wary of an enemy from above as the plane has little chance of getting away from them, especially if they are coming from the front.

After the conclusion of Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of North Africa) in November 1942, the United States supplied the Free French Air Forces with a batch of B-26C Marauders to replace the now obsolete Lioré et Olivier [[LeO 451 early|LeO 451]]s and Douglas [[DB-7 (Great Britain)|DB-7]]s. These B-26s were prominently used during the invasion of Italy and southern France. At the end of the war, seven out of nine of the Free French's bomber squadrons used the Marauder, taking part in 270 missions and 4,884 sorties. The Marauder were decommissioned from French service in July 1945, though some of them were retained as trainers and test beds, including one that was converted to test SNECMA ATAR jet engines.
