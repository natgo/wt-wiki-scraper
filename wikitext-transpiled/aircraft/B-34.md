== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].

The B-34 is a typical American bomber in the sense that its decent payload is outdone by its defensive armament. While its maximum payload and the ability to carry a torpedo is nice, it's not necessarily as good as its ability to take and give out damage to other aircraft. Start with base/pillbox bombing, and should an enemy fighter come to engage, give him hell with your turrets. Do slight ''maneuver''s constantly to throw off his shots while trying to put as many shells into his engine/pilot as possible. With any luck he will fall out of the sky in no time.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

While flying the B-34 you can expect manoeuvrability and speed like few other bombers. Considering you are just a [[:Category:Second rank aircraft|Rank II]] aircraft you have a good acceleration and max speed, which will allow you to get out of difficult situations, even being able to outrun some lower BR fighters, although never forget to use your turrets to shake enemies off your tail.

Your speed and climb ratio will be superior to most enemy bombers you face, therefore making it an easy task to intercept them. Although try to always keep it under 4,500 m as your engines aren't meant for high altitudes, and you will become a big and sluggish target for any fighter around. As a last defensive manoeuvre in this bomber it is possible to trade some altitude for speed in order to escape from a threat, however keep it at a max speed of 610 km/h IAS since going faster than that will completely lock your surface controls and eventually get you killed.

Given its surprising turn rate and speed for a bomber, mixed with a good offensive power, when used wisely you can successfully intercept enemy aircrafts that aren't yet aware of your position, as well as support your allies if you see an enemy tunnel vision-ed on them, however don't fool yourself into a dogfight since every fighter will outturn you sooner than later.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

In the hands of an experienced player, the B-34 can be one of, if not the deadliest aircraft of its tier. While being in the bomber line of the tech tree, the B-34 is better suited for use as a frontine bomber, bomber interceptor, and even a heavy fighter in some situations. If played in a bombing role, try to get in low and entice enemy fighters into chasing you while you go for your bombing targets; your powerful 12.7 mm turret will make quick work of most enemy's you'll encounter at its tier. If played as a bomber interceptor, aiming for crucial parts of the target's aircraft (Engine, wings, cockpit, Etc.) with your robust offensive armament will take down enemy bombers quickly and efficiently. Using the B-34 in a heavy fighter role will require the use of your flaps, so make sure to use them when appropriate; as the B-34 has poor energy retention. Head-on's with enemy fighters are ill-advised, as your pilot is quite susceptible to frontal enemy fire as well as your engines that will take damage quite easily.

Your deadliest enemies will be aircraft with heavy machine gun or cannon armament (P-400, LaGG-3-8, Spitfire Mk IIb, Etc.) It is advised to get familiar with using the 12.7 mm dorsal turret while doing evasive maneuvers using flaps for dealing with them quickly before they can do major damage to your aircraft. If they dive on you and fly in front of you for a bit, try to damage them with your frontal armament. Do not let anyone get under your belly, as it is a huge weak spot that knowledgeable players will exploit. In the hands of a skilled pilot, however, you will have no problem going for engine shutdowns or pilot snipes that will quickly send your foes back to the hangar.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Reasonably effective armament consisting of 2 x 7.62 mm Brownings and 2 x 12.7 mm Brownings that are nose mounted
- Durable airframe for its BR
- Reasonably effective defensive armament with good coverage on the rear section of the plane
- The dorsal turret can swivel 360 degrees and even fire at targets towards the nose of the plane
- Can provide initial cover for other bombers until fighters reach their altitude
- Blazing fast top speed compared to other medium bombers
- Reasonably large payload capacity.

'''Cons:'''

- The belly of the aircraft is a massive blind spot in the aircraft's defence
- Poor climb rate and energy retention
- For the most part, the offensive armament will only be useful in attacking enemy bombers, ground targets, or engaging fighters head-on, as the plane is not manoeuvrable enough for any real dog-fighting of any kind
- Steel construction makes this plane particularly heavy, and a small payload limits this plane's ability to be used as a tactical or strategic bomber
- The elevator can be shot off by an enemy plane easily, causing it to become uncontrollable, although it may still be controllable by operating flaps or adjusting engine power in some cases
- Poor manoeuvrability at lower speeds
- Landing gear is quite weak; breaks at >235 km/h

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

[[File:Lockheed PV-1 Ventura patrol bomber in flight.jpg|thumb|350px|right]]
In the beginning of the war, the British were looking for a medium-ranged anti-submarine warfare and patrol aircraft to support the existing Avro Anson. The Lockheed company sent a drawing of their Model 14 Super Electra civilian airliner. The British Purchasing Commission saw the design and asked Lockheed to make modifications to the Model 14. Modifications included two fixed forward-firing Browning 7.7 mm machine guns in the nose. There was also the installation of a Boulton Paul dorsal gun turret with two Browning machine guns. Some models had beam guns installed, while others had different engines or propellers. It was renamed the Lockheed Hudson. The Hudson served as the basis for the B-34 (Ventura, originally). It was developed from the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, another civilian airliner. The Ventura was first delivered to the British in 1942. Originally, it was used for daylight raids but, like other RAF bombers of the time, were vulnerable without fighter escort. It was transferred to Coastal Command. In US service, it was named the B-34 Lexington. There was also a reconnaissance variant called the B-37 (and later the RB-37, the "R" standing for "restricted," as in not for combat). Later on, a redesigned version, the PV-2 Harpoon, was put into service. The wingspan was increased, among other changes.
