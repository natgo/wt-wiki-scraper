== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''Martin B-57B Canberra''' was the second version of the license-built British [[Canberra (Family)|English Electric Canberra]] jet bomber/reconnaissance aircraft. Compared to the unarmed [[B-57A]] which was a complete copy of the original Canberra, the B-57B had several changes, most notably the inclusion of eight M3 Browning machine guns (and later four 20 mm M39 autocannons) as an offensive armament for strafing attack, an improved "fighter-style" cockpit that improved the pilot's visibility, a "rotary" bombing bay that improved the deployment time and accuracy of bombs, improved airbrakes, four additional hardpoints on the wings, and an addition of a radar warning receiver. These modifications proved to be a success, as it allowed the B-57B to be easily adapted into various roles, ranging from bombing to electronic warfare. In total, 202 B-57Bs were built, and served under the USAF in various roles through the Vietnam War before it was retired in 1983.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.47 "Big Guns"]]. Compared to its predecessor the [[B-57A]], the B-57B focuses more on low level ground attack and can carry large amounts of offensive external weaponry. B-57A players will rejoice upon unlocking the B-57B, as it is an improvement in almost every way, with actual offensive armament, better turn time, better payloads (including rockets and napalms), and overall versatility. Compared to the very similar [[Canberra B (I) Mk 6]], the B-57B starts out with eight Browning machine guns mounted quite far on the wings, which results into a much worse anti-air capability, though this can be upgraded with four 20 mm M39 autocannons with an incredible rate of fire, giving it a much harder-hitting punch than its British counterpart.

Whilst a lone B-57B out in the open is an easy target for intercepting aircraft and is no match for the likes of the [[MiG-15 (Family)|MiG-15]] or [[F-86 (Family)|Sabre]] in combat (especially with payloads), communication and coordination with teammates will allow pilots of this aircraft to effectively strike targets of strategic importance with precision and to devastating effect. Alternatively, a daring B-57B pilot may try their luck and use it as a makeshift "interceptor", not dissimilar to the French [[Vautour (Family)|Vautour]], and shred any plane below or in front of them with four blistering autocannons.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

Like the [[B-57A]], the B-57B has an overall smooth flight performance. The plane is generally responsive at all but higher speeds (above 900 km/h) and handles quite well. The plane has a decent turn rate (especially at around 600 - 700 km/h), though doing so will cost a lot of energy. Due to the weight, the B-57B has generally poor roll rate, especially in positive G rolls that would be almost guaranteed to stall a plane if performed at medium speeds.

Since the B-57B has a bomber airspawn, a crafty B-57B pilot may chose to forgo their bombing duties and play the B-57B as an "air defence fighter" instead. By not equipping any payload, the B-57B can climb significantly higher and turns quicker than before. This allows it to win a dogfight even against dedicated fighters should the player maintain their energy and altitude advantage.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* No armour plating
* 38 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured glass windscreen
* Critical components located in front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (3 in central fuselage, 1 in each wing)

Survivability of the B-57B is rather poor, with its large wings in particular being an obvious weakspots, as destroying the outer leading edges of the wings will sent the plane into an uncontrollable spin and inevitably crash the plane.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

There are two research routes a B-57B pilot can take; either researching the payload modification to deal higher damage against bases and ground vehicles, or research the "M39 cannon" to improve the plane's offensive capabilities. If one is to use the B-57B as a fighter, the "New 20 mm cannons are ''not'' recommended, as the improved trajectory will actually result in the 20 mm autocannons being harder to actually hit the targets due to awkward convergence. The other modifications then can be chosen at your liking.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M3 Browning (12.7 mm)|M39 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between two presets:
** 8 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns (300 rpg = 2,400 total)
** 4 x 20 mm M39 cannons (290 rpg = 1,160 total)

When stock, the B-57B is armed with eight .50 cal Browning machine guns mounted in the outer wings, resulting in awkward convergence angles. The guns has a very good rate of fire and ammo count, but they are generally mediocre against air targets due to the low damage output per rounds, thus requiring several hits to score critical damage, something that can be hard to achieve in fast-paced jet combat. Because of this, it is best reserved for strafing ground targets.

In case you wanted a better chance at downing enemy aircraft, the Canberra has an option to equip four 20 mm M39 autocannons. Compared to the Hispano Mk.V on its British cousin the [[Canberra B (I) Mk 6]], the M39 is mounted further apart on the wings rather than the centerline, resulting in poor convergence, but is more than made up with twice the rate of fire of 1,500 rpm, allowing it to easily cripple anything it hits.

Because of the gun's poor convergence, it is recommended ''not'' to install the "New 20 mm guns" modification, as this will cause the shell to spread and create a small cloud of lead that has a better chance of hitting any aircraft within its vicinity, especially in a head-ons or while chasing.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Unlike the [[B-57A]] model before it, the B-57B included numerous improvements and modifications to the airframe and armament that allow it to play a much more aggressive and offensive role in the battle. Able to mount up to 16 x 127 mm [[HVAR]] rockets on its external pylons in conjunction with heavy bomb loads, the B-57B is best suited to taking out armoured targets or naval targets such as destroyers and cruisers.

As well as its ability to deliver massive offensive potential to targets at high speeds, it is also equipped with eight wing-mounted 12.7 mm [[Browning M3 (12.7 mm)|Browning M3]] machine guns that hold a healthy 2,800 rounds of ammunition, allowing it to attack light targets with ease, but also provides air-to-air combat potential for pilots. However, these HMGs are fitted far on the outside of each wing making gun convergence a big issue. This can be improved with a switch to four 20 mm M39 autocannons that can easily shreds any planes apart, especially in head-ons.

Another novel feature of the B model is its rotating bomb bay that can hold large stores of a variety of bombs to complement its wing-mounted payloads. With a maximum potential loadout of 8 x [[AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)|1,000 lb bombs]] coupled with 8 x 127 mm HVAR rockets, the B-57B is one of the most versatile aircraft in-game at rank V.

By comparison to its contemporary jet attack-bombers of other nations, the [[IL-28]], [[Ar 234 C-3|Arado 234 C-3]], [[Canberra B (I) Mk 6|Canberra B (I) Mk 6]] and [[R2Y2 Kai V1|R2Y2]] series, the B-57B can carry the largest payload thanks to its external stores, making this the ideal choice for players who prefer more aggressive and direct attack roles in the skies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good low altitude performance
* Can use the bomber sight  
* Great horizontal manoeuvrability, especially without payloads
* While not carry any payload, the plane has a decent climb rate and straight line energy retention
* High acceleration provides enough speed to outrun most pre-Korean War jets
* Can mount four 20 mm autocannons that can easily rip any enemy aircraft apart
* The 20mm have a very high rate of fire
* Impressive and versatile payload
* Great cockpit visibility in SB

'''Cons:'''

* Large target, its wings in particular are very vulnerable
* Slower than half enemy jets it faces
* Poor performance at high altitude
* Poor roll rate and energy retention; loses tons of speed in turns
* Has a lower rate of climb than the B-57A
* Can find some enemy fighters with Air-to-Air missile

The Martin B-57B was a development of the licence-built version of the British [[Canberra B Mk 2|Canberra B Mk 2]], the [[B-57A]]. After its impressive performances at the Farnborough airshows in the early 1950s, the United States of America were keen to acquire the record setting jet bomber to fulfil the role of fast attacker similar to their current [[A-26C-45|A-26]] model. America had no suitable replacements for the Invader's position and experiences in Korea had proven the value of an Interdiction attacker.

As such, licence production of the Canberra was given by English Electric to Martin for the B-57A. Whilst the A model was essentially the same as the British variant, the B model had numerous improvements and changes over the A model that distinguishes it from the original Canberra design. Features such as a redesigned canopy that required 2 crew rather than 3, newer engines, improved wing strength coupled with pylons for large external stores, more effective airbrakes and the Martin's reduced drag rotary bomb bay from previous test aircraft were all included into the B model. As well as this, the B-57B also had offensive armament in the form of 8 Browning M3 machine guns with 4 in each wing, however, this was later updated to 4 x 20 mm M39 cannon.

All of this combined lead to the emergence of a highly effective interdiction aircraft that now differed greatly from its British counterpart to which it was based upon. Even with the rapid pace of jet aircraft development, the B-57B continued on in service thanks to its flexibility and versatility of combat roles. Numerous payloads options and configurations existed that allowed for a multitude of possible tasks including interdiction, reconnaissance or high altitude bombing. Whilst the primary models would retire in the late 1970s towards the early 1980s, highly modified variants still continue to serve in research and development roles for NASA even today.
