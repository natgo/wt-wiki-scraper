== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American jet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.47 "Big Guns"]].

Placed in the bomber line within the US tech tree, the Martin B-57B jet bomber is a licensed-built version of the famous English Electric British aircraft that leads away from the standard gameplay found on most US heavy bombers before it. Placed well within Rank V after its predecessor, the [[B-57A]], the B-57B focuses more on low level ground attack by comparison to its predecessors and can carry large amounts of offensive external weaponry.

B-57A players will rejoice upon unlocking the B-57B, as it is an improvement in almost every way, with actual armament, better turn time, better payloads (including rockets).

Whilst a lone B-57B out in the open is an easy target for intercepting aircraft and is no match for the likes of the [[MiG-15 (Family)|MiG-15]] or [[F-86 (Family)|Sabre]] in combat, communication and coordination with teammates will allow pilots of this aircraft to effectively strike targets of strategic importance with precision and to devastating effect. Equally organizing squads paired with escorting fighters who can work in conjunction with B-57s or even a whole wing of attack aircraft can have a massive impact on top tier games.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Unlike the [[B-57A]] model before it, the B-57B included numerous improvements and modifications to the airframe and armament that allow it to play a much more aggressive and offensive role in the battle. Able to mount up to 16 x 127 mm [[HVAR]] rockets on its external pylons in conjunction with heavy bomb loads, the B-57B is best suited to taking out armoured targets or naval targets such as destroyers and cruisers.

As well as its ability to deliver massive offensive potential to targets at high speeds, it is also equipped with 8 wing-mounted 12.7 mm [[Browning M3 (12.7 mm)|Browning M3]] machine guns that hold a healthy 2,800 rounds of ammunition, allowing it to attack light targets with ease, but also provides air-to-air combat potential for pilots. However, these HMGs are fitted far on the outside of each wing making gun convergence a big issue. Another novel feature of the B model is its rotating bomb bay that can hold large stores of a variety of bombs to complement its wing-mounted payloads. With a maximum potential loadout of 8 x [[AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)|1,000 lb bombs]] coupled with 8 x 127 mm HVAR rockets, the B-57B is one of the most versatile aircraft in-game at rank V.

By comparison to its contemporary jet attack-bombers of other nations, the [[IL-28]], [[Ar 234 C-3|Arado 234 C-3]], [[Canberra B (I) Mk 6|Canberra B (I) Mk 6]] and [[R2Y2 Kai V1|R2Y2]] series, the B-57B can carry the largest payload thanks to its external stores, making this the ideal choice for players who prefer more aggressive and direct attack roles in the skies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good low altitude performance
* Great horizontal manoeuvrability
* High acceleration provides enough speed to outrun most pre-Korean War jets
* Good offensive armament of 8 x M3 Browning MGs
* Impressive and versatile payload

'''Cons:'''

* Large target, its wings in particular are very vulnerable
* Slower than most enemy jets it faces
* Guns are mounted far apart; convergence is an issue
* Poor performance at altitude
* Poor roll rate and energy retention; loses tons of speed in turns
* Commonly faces early anti-air missiles in which the plane is completely defenceless against

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Martin B-57B was a development of the licence-built version of the British [[Canberra B Mk 2|Canberra B Mk 2]], the [[B-57A]]. After its impressive performances at the Farnborough airshows in the early 1950s, the United States of America were keen to acquire the record setting jet bomber to fulfil the role of fast attacker similar to their current [[A-26C-45|A-26]] model. America had no suitable replacements for the Invader's position and experiences in Korea had proven the value of an Interdiction attacker.

As such, licence production of the Canberra was given by English Electric to Martin for the B-57A. Whilst the A model was essentially the same as the British variant, the B model had numerous improvements and changes over the A model that distinguishes it from the original Canberra design. Features such as a redesigned canopy that required 2 crew rather than 3, newer engines, improved wing strength coupled with pylons for large external stores, more effective airbrakes and the Martin's reduced drag rotary bomb bay from previous test aircraft were all included into the B model. As well as this, the B-57B also had offensive armament in the form of 8 Browning M3 machine guns with 4 in each wing, however, this was later updated to 4 x 20 mm M39 cannon.

All of this combined lead to the emergence of a highly effective interdiction aircraft that now differed greatly from its British counterpart to which it was based upon. Even with the rapid pace of jet aircraft development, the B-57B continued on in service thanks to its flexibility and versatility of combat roles. Numerous payloads options and configurations existed that allowed for a multitude of possible tasks including interdiction, reconnaissance or high altitude bombing. Whilst the primary models would retire in the late 1970s towards the early 1980s, highly modified variants still continue to serve in research and development roles for NASA even today.
