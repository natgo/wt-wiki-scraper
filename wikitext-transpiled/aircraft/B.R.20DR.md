== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]] alongside the initial Italian aviation tree.

The BR.20 has a superb bomb load and is quite strong, being able to soak up a bit more damage than other comparable bombers. The defensive armament has excellent coverage; however, the dorsal gunner is quite exposed and commonly gets hit while in combat. It not only looks but also flies like a brick. This is a very slow plane and in Arcade and Realistic battles, and because these game modes are so short, by the time you reach your bombing target the match may almost be over! The BR.20 is still however quite a treat to fly and is stable and well suited to Simulator.

Another very interesting strategy the BR.20 DR is capable of is ironically, attacking other bombers. When the top & front gunner are pointed forward, the combined firepower of three 7.7 machine guns makes for a nasty surprise, especially if loaded with the AP-I belt!

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- No armour
- 6 self-sealing fuel tanks (2 in the frontal fuselage, mounted to the right, 2 in each wing)
- Can survive some hits from calibres below 23 mm
- Tail is prone to breaking easily
- Very good gunner positions for defensive coverage

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Air battles'''

The BR.20 DR is a very good bomber at its BR, at the start of battle climb to 3,000-4,500 m, and go to destroy the enemy bases, as everytime enemy fighters or other planes are gonna attack you, use your gunners to kill enemy planes, use Universal belt because it contains 1 tracer and 3 AP-I shells per belt. The AP-I shells are perfect for killing enemy planes because they can knock out the enemy pilot or set on fire the enemy planes. When you are near the enemy base, use your bomber sight for drop your bombs and after it return to the airfield to reload your bombs.

'''Ground battles'''

You can use the BR.20 DR in ground mode, use these following payloads: 4 x 250kg (GP 250) or 2 x 500 kg (GP 500) or 2 x 800kg (GP 800). After spawning with the BR.20 DR, stay at 900-1,500 m altitude and use your bomb sight to drop your bombs more accurately. Your bombs are very good so if the bombs happen to get close to enemy medium and heavy tanks, they can be very easily destroyed.

'''AB Mode'''

Like any bomber in Arcade Battles, they are the first too be destroyed, climb to 4,000 m-5,000 m and stay at that altitude and drop your bombs on enemy bases but remember that you can be destroyed very easily by enemy planes so be careful and check around you if they are incoming enemy planes.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Good payload for its rank
- Fast in a dive
- Pitches very well
- Combination of roof & front turret and high spawn can easily disable enemy bombers

'''Cons:'''

- Rolls very badly, poor yaw
- Slow speed

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The standard Italian bomber of World War 2, the B.R.20 was a technically advanced bomber for its time. More than 500 were produced over seven years, and it served on all of Italy's fronts, including Africa, Russia, the Mediterranean, and the Balkans. B.R.20s based in Belgium participated in the Battle of Britain, taking heavy losses.

Designed by Fiat's Celestino Rosatelli, the B.R.20 had a metal structure and duralumin/fabric covering. Its specifications had called for a top speed of 388 km/h, a bomb load of 1,200 kg, and a range of 960 km, all of which it easily surpassed. Two modified B.R.20s competed in the 1937 Istres-Damascus-Paris air race, but did not win. In 1939, another modified B.R.20 set an endurance record for a 4,800 km flight from Rome to Addis Ababa, averaging more than 400 km/h along the route.

From 1937 to 1939 B.R.20s served in the Spanish Civil War. The model did less well in the Battle of Britain, where the Italian air corps lost a quarter of its 80 B.R.20Ms in their first 300 hours in the air. The model continued to be produced until 1942.
