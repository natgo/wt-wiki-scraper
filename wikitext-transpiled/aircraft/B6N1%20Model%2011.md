== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28IJN.29_Official_name_designation|officially designated]] the "Tenzan" (Heavenly Mountain)) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]].

The Tenzan is the replacement of the [[B5N2|B5N]] offering a longer range and better speed. It comes defended with an additional rear machine gun in a ventral position compared to the B5N. Plagued with mechanical issues caused by the Nakajima Mamoru 11 engine, it would be replaced rather quickly by the [[B6N2 Model 12]].

{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Great rudder responsiveness, good roll rate, and surprisingly good energy retention! The {{PAGENAME}} is capable of turnfighting with its humble frontal machine gun, and if they get on your 6, your turrets will offer some protection.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* No armour
* Non-self sealing fuel tanks (3 in each wing)

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 7.7 mm Type 97 navy machine gun, wing-mounted (400 rpg)[[File:B6N1GrayCamo.png|thumb|B6N1 in Gray camouflage, available on WT Live ]]

Choose your rounds wisely. The Stealth belt is a great pick because it has two incendiary bullets, and lots of armour-piercing rounds. Universal is a great pick if you need a tracer or two to guide your shots. Don't use the Tracers belt, it won't do much. Default isn't really good, the ball bullets hinder performance.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Navy Type 97 Number 6 (60 kg)|Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 (250 kg)|Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 (800 kg)|Type 91 Model 2 (835 kg)|Type 91 Model 3 (850 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 6 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (360 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 bombs (500 kg total)
* 1 x 800 kg Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 bomb (800 kg total)
* 1 x 835 kg Type 91 Model 2 torpedo
* 1 x 850 kg Type 91 Model 3 torpedo

The 800 kg bomb will destroy 1 base, it's a good pick for maps with few ground targets! The 250 kg bombs are great for destroying pillboxes and tanks, but you can only have two of them. Make sure to use a slight dive when bombing and use the bombsight for increased accuracy! The 6 x 60 kg bombs are a great option for this plane. Since they weigh so little, you can be super accurate with these bombs, just aim the crosshair where you want the bomb to drop, and pull up. No need for a bomb sight!!! Use these bombs for light targets such as AAA, Vehicles, Armoured Cars, Artillery, Howitzers, Machine Guns, and Bridges. The torpedoes are not really useful for this plane in air battles, as ships only spawn in pacific maps, and this plane is at too low of a BR to be put in a Pacific Theater battle.

[[File:B6N1GrayCamo2.png|thumb|B6N1 showing off its large wings. These wings give the plane a great speed and turning ability]]

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 92 (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun, dorsal turret (679 rpg)
* 1 x 7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun, ventral turret (679 rpg)

The Type 92 turrets are absolutely horrible at dealing with higher BR planes, but it works wonders on biplanes. You will often face certain biplanes at this BR, and since they are slow, you can often get good shots on them. Use the Default belt and shoot into the engine to start an inextinguishable engine fire. This works quite often with the Default belt. The AP-T round is a good pick if you aren't a good gunner, because the extra tracers will scare the enemy off. Most biplanes don't want to get too close when they see a wave of tracers appear from your turrets.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This plane is great for bombing medium tanks, light pillboxes, howitzers, and vehicles. Since it is so fast, it can make multiple trips to the airfield if a resupply of bombs is needed.

For naval maps and naval gamemode it's best advised to bring the torpedo and hit ships in a quick, close, hit and run style torpedo run, the engine allows for high speeds and Japanese torpedoes are among the highest speed resistant torpedoes in-game at the cost of range of only 2 km. It is also a possibility of squading up with friends / other torpedo carrying planes to dispose of the enemy carriers / battleships in a multiple hit torpedo strike.

Your frontal machine gun is your biggest asset. Unlike the B5N2 or other B6Ns, the B6N1 carries a frontal machine gun that can destroy light AAA trucks or Armoured cars. Or even enemy planes in uptiers, as the B6N has an amazing turn rate for a monoplane, but will have issues trying to out-turn biplanes.

{{main|B6N (Family)#History|l1=History of the B6N}}

An excellent replacement for the Nakajima B5N in the role of on-board torpedo aircraft, the B6N Tenzan entered service very late, after more than two years of testing. Named JILL in the Allied code, this large single-engine plane appeared as a prototype in spring 1941. The first tests revealed serious steering stability problems. Subsequently, there were difficulties in developing the engine and the need to reinforce the landing gear. After 133 units of the first version of the B6N1 were built, the second production model began to be delivered towards the end of 1943. A total of 1,268 units were built.

The B6N1 was the first stage of the B6N series, and was fitted with a Nakajima NK7A Mamoru engine in favor by Nakajima instead of the more readily and proved Mitsubishi Kasei engine the Navy suggested.

After 2 prototypes of the B6N1, 133 B6N1s were manufactured and immediately issued to the last remaining aircraft carrier groups such as on the Japanese carrier Zuikaku.

Due the slow and costy production of the NK7A engine, the B6N1 was halted in production in favor of the [[B6N2 Model 12|B6N2]] with Mitsubishi MK4T Kasei 25 engine.
