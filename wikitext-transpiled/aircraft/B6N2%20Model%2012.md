== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28IJN.29_Official_name_designation|officially designated]] the "Tenzan" (Heavenly Mountain)) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]].

The Tenzan 12 is a simple improvement over the [[B6N1 Model 11|Tenzan 11]] by switching out Nakajima's failed engine with the Navy-demanded proven Mitsubishi Kasei 25 engine. This would become the main production variant of the [[B6N (Family)]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- No armour
- Non-self sealing fuel tanks (3 in each wing)

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Navy Type 97 Number 6 (60 kg)|Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 (250 kg)|Number 80 Mod. 1 (800 kg)|Type 91 Model 2 (835 kg)|Type 91 Model 3 (850 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 6 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (360 kg total)
- 2 x 250 kg Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 bombs (500 kg total)
- 1 x 800 kg Number 80 Mod. 1 bomb (800 kg total)
- 1 x 835 kg Type 91 Model 2 torpedo
- 1 x 850 kg Type 91 Model 3 torpedo

The 800 kg bomb will destroy 1 base, it's a good pick for maps with few ground targets. The 250 kg bombs are great for destroying pillboxes and tanks, but you can only have two of them. Make sure to use a slight dive when bombing and use the bombsight for increased accuracy. The 6 x 60 kg bombs are a great option for this plane. Since they weigh so little, you can be super accurate with these bombs, just aim the crosshair where you want the bomb to drop, and pull up. No need for a bomb sight. Use these bombs for light targets such as AAA, vehicles, armoured cars, artillery, howitzers, machine guns, and bridges. The torpedoes are not really useful for this plane in air battles, as ships only spawn in pacific maps, and this plane is at too low of a BR to be put in a Pacific Theater battle.

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Type 92 (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun, dorsal turret (679 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun, ventral turret (679 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This plane is great for bombing medium tanks, light pillboxes, howitzers, and vehicles. Since it is so fast, it can make multiple trips to the airfield if a resupply of bombs is needed.

For naval maps and naval gamemode it's best advised to bring the torpedo and hit ships in a quick, close, hit and run style torpedo run, the engine allows for high speeds and Japanese torpedoes are among the highest speed resistant torpedoes in-game at the cost of range of only 2 km. It is also a possibility of squading up with friends / other torpedo carrying planes to dispose of the enemy carriers / battleships in a multiple hit torpedo strike.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

{{main|B6N (Family)#History|l1=History of the B6N}}

An excellent replacement for the Nakajima B5N in the role of on-board torpedo aircraft, the B6N Tenzan entered service very late, after more than two years of testing. Named JILL in the Allied code, this large single-engine plane appeared as a prototype in spring 1941. The first tests revealed serious steering stability problems. Subsequently, there were difficulties in developing the engine and the need to reinforce the landing gear. After 133 units of the first version of the B6N1 were built, the second production model began to be delivered towards the end of 1943. A total of 1,268 units were built.

The B6N2 is the main production model of the B6N series thanks to a more readily available Mitsubishi ''Kansei'' engine, instead of a in-house Nakajima ''Mamori'' engine trialed on the [[B6N1 Model 11|B6N1]].

The B6N2 has seen alot of use in the southern pacific land bases and few remaining carrier groups. Due to lack of experienced pilots and growing allied air power, the B6N couldn't accomplish the same / better feats the B5N has done in its prior years of the war and damage to the enemy fleet were low and overall performance was average.
