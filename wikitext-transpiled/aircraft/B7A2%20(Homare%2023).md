== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a prototype to test the new Homare 23 engine on the [[B7A2]] which boasted 200 hp more than the Homare 12 installed on the production line of the B7A2. Other than the engine, the fuselage, wings, and armament haven't changed resulting in an enhanced [[B7A2]] which wasn't able to be mass-produced.

The Ryusei (Homare 23) was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XII, "Armour Breaking Ambusher"]]. Like its previous production model, the [[B7A2]], it's deceivingly manoeuvrable and has an even stronger engine for the same plane, still lacking any real armour. It can bite back with its defensive 13 mm machine gun or engage frontally with two wing-mounted Type 99 Model 2 cannons. While technically classified as a carrier-borne torpedo bomber, it is very capable of fulfilling the roles of dive-, level-, and torpedo bombing targets. While the max tonnage of bombs doesn't increase over the previous [[B6N (Family)|B6N Tenzan]], it can carry four additional wing-mounted 60 kg bombs next to its bomb bay that can load two 250 kg or six 60 kg. The main playstyle of the B7A2 is more like an unarmoured attacker, using its arsenal of bombs and cannons on targets either in the sky, on the ground, or on the sea with the deadly precision of its gyrostabilized dive-bomber sight.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The B7A2 has a single 13 mm steel plate behind the engine that protects the pilot from head-on attacks. It works well, however the aircraft itself is still very fragile. Although it contains self-sealing fuel tanks, the B7A2 is still vulnerable to catching fire. The tanks in the wing only make the problem worse. The B7A2 should not be involved in combat where it requires the use of the tail gunner. The best strategy is to use evasive manoeuvres because of the plane's good manoeuvrability but poor survivability.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ryusei is best utilized as a multi-role aircraft, similar to the role the [[Ju 87 D-5]] plays. Once its payload is dropped, the B7A2 becomes a low altitude dogfighter similar to an A6M. In realistic battles, the B7A2 is often paired with aircraft such as the [[A6M3]], [[A6M3 mod. 22]], and [[A6M3 mod. 22Ko]]. If unable to shake an enemy off your tail, these "Zeroes" can be relied on as they have impressive low altitude capabilities.

Payload choice is dependent on target choice. If the target is a light pillbox, for instance, one does not need an 800 kg bomb. Instead, equip either of the other bomb loadout options. The same goes for most ground units, apart from arcade mini bases. The Ryusei is similar to aircraft such as the [[Ki-49-IIa]] in that it can "hover" above an enemy base or airfield, rapidly dropping its payload and diving up to altitude again. Since the B7A2 is a dive bomber, it does not have to be level to drop its payload accurately. The Ryusei's ability to "hover" above enemy mini bases and airfields can be a great help to any arcade battles team. Upgrading the crew reload speed makes this aircraft a potential game-winner, especially when in a squad.

Having a B7A2 on any team, no matter the game mode, never hurts.
