The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

In the mid-1930s, tensions were rising in Europe and the Soviet Union. Taking a look at the Soviet air forces of the time, it was determined that there was a need for a multi-purpose combat aircraft, which would not specialize in a role, but could be utilized as a bomber, attacker and even as a combat fighter if needed, however, its main job would be as a reconnaissance aircraft which would then attack targets it came across. Joseph Stalin personally issued the requirement for this aircraft and the project was code-named ''Ivanov''. P.O. Sukhoi became the chief designer of this proposed aircraft while working at the Tupolev experimental design bureau and designed what initially was known as the ANT-51 first flying in 1937. Though a disappointment due to being outfitted with an 820 hp Shvetsov M-62 engine, the aircraft was outfitted with a Tumansky M-87 engine and now began production as the {{PAGENAME}} (Blizhniy Bombardirovschik; Russian: Ближний Бомбардировщик — "short-range bomber").

The {{PAGENAME}} is a very forgiving aircraft, especially to those who are new to attack aircraft. While not a fast aircraft, it does allow pilots to buzz tree-tops and follow the terrain on the way to the targets. Though not an aircraft which is adequate to bomb bases, it does have a keen ability to ''hover'' slowly weaving around a battlefield where light trucks, anti-aircraft artillery and light tanks will be about. The bomb options and the machine gun load-outs allow for this attacker to drop bombs on ground targets along with strafing them with machine guns. Once passed the targets, the {{PAGENAME}} can easily manoeuvre around and begin the attack run again. Enemy attackers and fighters which come along will attempt to eliminate the {{PAGENAME}}, but will quickly realize there is a rear-facing dorsal turret which a gunner mans a 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun which are relatively fast firing and can be quite effective at times, hitting, damaging, and disabling aircraft which choose to sit on the {{PAGENAME}}'s tail. Though not a strong suit of the attacker, it can if need be, engage as a fighter. This attacker will not win any speed records when dogfighting, though, with its large wings and rudder, it does have the ability to turn remarkably fast making it difficult for an enemy fighter to get a firing solution.

Many War Thunder matches have been won with the {{PAGENAME}} or its younger siblings ([[Su-2 (Family)|Su-2s]]) loading up with the smaller 50 kg bombs and methodically bombing key ground vehicles while the fighters continue to chase each other around. Don't let a lone {{PAGENAME}} fooling you into thinking it won't do much damage, it is better to eliminate these aircraft first before brawling in dog fights with other fighters.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The BB-1 has relatively good top speed and manoeuvrability for its battle rating. It can outrun most things it fights, and handles like a fighter without any bombs, albeit climbing isn't its strong suit. You shouldn't have to worry about rip speed or compression; being an attacker it should never reach a speed where that will become an issue.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- No armour plating
- No armour glazing
- Critical components located at the front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)
- More fuel tanks located in wings near the fuselage

The {{PAGENAME}} was meant to be a light-weight attacker/bomber which could be produced rather quickly. To perform its mission adequately with the engines which were slated to be used, this aircraft needed to remain as light as possible, but still be able to carry an effective load of bombs. To eliminate weight where possible included not installing any protective armour or bulletproof windshields. Crazy as it sounds, another weight-saving method was to utilize wood panelling which is poor protection even against smaller 7 mm machine gun rounds. Though three fuel tanks are found in the aircraft (one in the fuselage in front of the cockpit and one in each wing), an ingenious solution of the time aided in the prevention of fuel tank fires and that was due to the aircraft having the ability to vent exhaust into the fuel tanks, preventing the burning of the fuel if the tank becomes ruptured. In-game, the BB-1 can tank a fair few hits from rifle-calibre MGs, but anything armed with 12.7 mm or larger will tear it apart.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:BB-1 an trn 26 002.jpg|450px|thumb|right|The [[BB-1]]'s defensive gunner firing away with his [[ShKAS (7.62 mm)|ShKAS]] machine gun.]]
The BB-1 is one of the best low-BR ground attackers available, and is potent in every game mode. In Air Battles, it's advisable to take the 12 x 50 kg loadout, as it will allow you to do a bit of base-bombing. In Mixed battles, the most potent loadout is the 2 x 250 kg option, which will destroy or critically damage most tanks around this BR, even if you don't get a precise hit. It is recommended to set a 1.5s fuse for low-altitude attacks. After you are out of bombs, you can engage other fighters/attackers or strafe out AAA, light tanks and open topped vehicles (these are plentiful in low tier ground battles). It is not advised to dogfight but it does well in a head-on (because of the rate of fire, not the armour).

OKB Sukhoi BB-1 (Su-2) "Ivanov" Short-Range Bomber with M-87 engine

A single-engine, mixed-construction monoplane light bomber with retractable landing gear and tail wheel.

This project was developed as an entry in the 1936 competition for the best high-speed long-range ground-attack reconnaissance plane, to be known as the "Ivanov". The design and construction were completed in a record time of 6 months. The first flight of the SZ-1 (SZ: "Stalin's Mission"), with an M-62 engine, was made on August 25, 1937.

The prototype selected for mass production was the SZ-3, equipped with an M-87 engine. In March of 1939, even before government tests were completed, the "Ivanov" airplane (with the M-87A engine) was accepted by the Red Army Air Force. It entered mass production under the designation BB-1 (short-range bomber one).

Unlike the prototypes, the production model had a mixed construction. The fuselage was a wooden monocoque with plywood paneling, and the wings and stabilizer were metal. This choice was made because, due to the many all-metal aircraft in the USSR at the time, metal was in short supply.

The first production aircraft were fitted with air-cooled radial 14-cylinder OKB Tumansky M-87 engines, rated at 950 hp.

The aircraft's armament included a battery of 4 fixed ShKAS 7.62 mm machine guns with 850 rounds each, mounted in pairs on each wing. To protect the aircraft's rear, the navigator had a rotating MB-5 turret with another 7.62 mm machine gun with 900 rounds of ammunition.

The prototypes had a ventral MB-2 turret with a ShKAS machine gun, but this was removed as it seemed unlikely that any enemy fighter attacks would come from below when the plane was flying at a low altitude. However, it was soon shown that this was a poor decision, as such attacks were frequent in actual combat.

The plane's usual bomb load, when flying at its maximum range, was 400 kg. Overweight capacity was up to 600 kg. The maximum bomb load was 1200 kg. Bombs of up to 100 kg could be placed both in the internal bomb bay and suspended under the outer wings. KD-1 or KD-2 bomb racks were used to carry and drop these bombs. Rockets were not carried.
