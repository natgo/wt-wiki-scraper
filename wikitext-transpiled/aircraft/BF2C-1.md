== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

A carrier-based biplane fighter available to new players as a reserve. It has the peculiarity of being the only reserve biplane (and reserve plane overall) in the game with a retractable landing gear, giving it an advantage when it comes to aerodynamics.

Furthermore, the Goshawk is also capable of providing close air support, making it a nice pick for mixed battles.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The BF2C-1 has no armoured plates. All critical systems are located ahead of the pilot. While the fuel tank is self-sealing, a good fire will bring your plane down very quickly before it has a chance to work its magic. Any engine damage reduces your speed to dangerous levels, so avoid tailing bombers and head-on attacks against fighters.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Browning (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.62 mm Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (600 rpg = 1,200 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
The BF2C-1 has 4 x 100 lb bombs, which makes it good in combined battles as CAS, but it's not recommended to take these bombs in air battles as the BF2C-1 is a very slow plane, making it even weaker in turnfights.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Air Battles (AB and RB):'''

As with other biplanes, the BF2C-1 should be used as a turnfighter. But while this is a viable tactic against less manoeuvrable targets, you might struggle to turnfight other biplanes, which could turn better than you (for example, the Soviet biplanes). In that case, if you're engaging an opponent that's more agile than you, try to apply Boom and Zoom tactics instead.

The Goshawk can also use its four 100 lb bombs to attack ground targets in both Arcade and Realistic battles.

'''Mixed Battles (Tank and Naval Battles):'''

The BF2C-1 is an excellent pick for mixed battles. Being a fighter-bomber, it can both engage enemy aircraft and provide close air support. Most of the targets at this plane's Battle Rating are lightly armoured, so they can be easily destroyed by your bombs (boats can also be easily destroyed, but ships might require multiple bombs to be sunk).

Just remember that equipping the bombs will make your plane heavier, so if you find a major threat in the air, don't be afraid to release your bombs to make your plane lighter and efficiently engage the enemy.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Capable of taking off and landing on aircraft carriers
* Has a retractable landing gear, unlike other reserve aircraft
* Easy to fly
* Features suspended armament, which comes in handy in mixed battles

'''Cons:'''

* Weak offensive armament
* Suspended armament requires precise hits in order to damage medium and heavily armoured targets
* Slow
