== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Danger Zone"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VIII, "Field Testing"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The BV 155 B-1 has below average energy retention, diving speed and roll rate at altitude below 4.5 km, and it becomes more problematic if you don't have any energy left, making it harder to escape from a enemy with the upper hand or with a higher energy potential than you.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 57 mm Bulletproof glass (60°), central pane of the windshield
* 57 mm Bulletproof glass (18°), side panes of the windshield

The fuel tank is located in the enlarged wing spar.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MK 108 (30 mm)|MG 151 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 30 mm MK 108 cannon, nose-mounted (75 rpg)
* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, wing-mounted (200 rpg = 400 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Realistic Battles:'''

The BV 155 B-1 has some similarity with the playstyle of the [[Ho 229 V3]] and you may get familiar to it, you need to keep in mind that BV 155 needs energy to keep its good performance, but at the same time trying to maintain IAS low due its constant compression at high speeds, it means you have to maintain the altitude and energy all the time to avoid any enemy fighter getting the upper hand on you, which means you will have a hard time escaping from it (even bombers such as SB2C may catch you easily), as you bleed considerably in long dogfights and have below average diving speed, bad straight line acceleration and top speed at most common engagement altitudes (3 km and 5 km). But this plane can be very efficient when you get used to its BnZ and turn rate or bomber hunting capabilities (due its very reliable weaponry) while you don't let anyone dive on you and getting more energy.

Ideally, you should not commit to head-on engagements as your only protection is the 57 mm bulletproof glass of the windshield, which is completely inadequate against fighters equipped with cannons.

'''Enemy worth mentioning:'''

[[Ki-43-III otsu]] - It may outclimb the BV 155 at the beginning of a match and must be avoided if at higher altitude. This plane can rope-a-dope and outturn you, so proceed with caution.

Spitfires - Some spitfires may not seem a threat as they have a very lower performance at high altitude compared to yours, but as it can make you bleed your energy and after that accelerate to catch your tail, Spitfires need to have treated properly as dangerous enemies. BnZ is recommended and dogfights need to be avoided.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely impressive performance at any altitude if it has energy (can even outturn some turnfighters depending on the circumstance)
* Has combat flaps to even faster turns
* Very powerful cannons with effective belts against air targets that can rip apart large bombers
* Decent climb rate that comes along with airspawn in RB

'''Cons:'''

* Large wingspan makes you an easy target
* Lacking of armour makes bomber hunting slightly harder
* The engine tends to overheat too often if radiator is damaged
* 2 out of 3 cannons are mounted in wings
* Compresses past 700 km/h and doesn't have airbrakes
* Poor flight performance at lower atltitudes
