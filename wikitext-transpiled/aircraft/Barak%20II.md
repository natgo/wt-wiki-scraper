In the late 1970s, Israel began its ambitious project to produce its first locally-manufactured jet fighter, meant to replace the aging [[Kfir C.7|IAI Kfir]]. Learning from their previous work on the [[Mirage 5 (Family)|Mirage]] and Kfir programs, and borrowing ideas from America's then-new [[F-16A]] fighter jet (which had entered IAF service in 1980 as the "[[Netz]]"), Israeli aeronautic engineers were able to develop a highly-manoeuvrable, delta-wing, single-seat fighter of their own - the IAI Lavi.

After nearly a decade of development the Lavi's first prototype was flown in 1986, and reportedly proved extremely capable. The United States, which had up to that point supported and partially funded the Lavi project, was dismayed to learn that the new aircraft might be good enough to provide a much cheaper competitor for the F-16 on the export market. The Reagan administration soon began pressuring the Israeli government to cancel the project. Though Israel's defense minister Moshe Arens was strongly behind the Lavi, the project's ever-increasing pricetag made it easy for the rest of the Israeli government to agree to US demands. The Lavi project was finally canceled in late 1987.

As compensation for torpedoing Israel's fighter manufacture ambitions, the United States agreed to sell Israel additional F-16Cs and Ds. A significant number of them, all from the Block 30 model, had already been sold to Israel by that point, entering IAF service under the codename ''"Barak"'' (Lightning) in late 1987. In 1988, the US and Israel signed that new "compensation" deal - named "Peace Marble III" - delivering a total of 60 F-16s, all from Block 40, between 1991 and 1993. Half were F-16Cs and half were F-16Ds (single-seat and double-seat, respectively). In the IAF, these new Block 40 aircraft were named ''"Barak II"'' (Lightning II), correspondingly amending the name of the older Block 30 aircraft to ''"Barak I"'' (note: the IAF does not keep separate names for single- and double-seat variants of the F-16).

The F-16C/D has several advantages over the F-16A/B, but the most important is the ability to mount a LANTIRN pod, turning the plane into an all-weather operator. As Israeli engineers had done with all other combat planes purchased for the IAF in the last 50 years, they also updated most of the avionics and introduced many locally-manufactured, cutting-edge improvements. This included completely redone Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) and in-helmet Heads-Up Display (HUD), among multiple other changes.

Barak II aircraft have taken part in almost every Israeli military campaign since their introduction, including the Second Lebanon War of 2006. Nevertheless, the changing needs of the Israeli Air Force have created a demand for a more dedicated fighter in the long-distance and precision-strike roles, resulting in the birth of the F-16I "Sufa". This heavily-modified F-16D Block 52 has since completely replaced the ''Barak'' in those roles, leaving it only with mid-altitude interception duties, which it still performs to this day. However, with the F-35 ''"Adir"'' now increasingly filling ''that'' role, there are ever-growing calls within the Israeli military community to finally retire the Barak II.
