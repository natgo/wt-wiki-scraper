== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Baz Meshupar''' (lit. "Improved Baz") was an Israeli upgrade to the [[Baz]] (IAF designation for the [[F-15A]]/B and [[F-15C MSIP II|F-15C]]/D) introduced from 1998. It featured new domestic electronics systems and avionics borrowed from the [[Barak II|F-16 Barak]], providing a helmet-mounted display and the capability to active-radar homing missiles, approaching the standards of the F-15E Strike Eagle. While attempts have been made since its introduction to replace it with imports such as the F-15E, F-16D, and F-35, the Baz Meshupar maintains its status as Israel's primary air superiority fighter to this day.

Introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]], the '''Baz Meshupar''' is akin to an Israeli version of the [[F-15C MSIP II]], with the same armament and systems. It has access to the AIM-120A AMRAAM, a great ARH missile with very long range, a terminal self-guidance system, as well as advanced inertial navigation. This is the weapon that defines the F-15C, however, this aircraft also relies on its excellent flight performance for aerial dogfights. For short-medium range combat, it has access to AIM-9M air-to-air missiles, with IRCCM and very good manoeuvrability. However, it lacks access to modern AGMs or laser guided bombs.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a very agile fighter, its top speed is not as high as other fighters like the [[MiG-29SMT]], but it compensates this with good energy retention, excellent acceleration and an adequate low speed manoeuvrability, after dogfights, the F-15C is capable to regain its speed quickly thanks to its good power to weight ratio.

''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.''

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The most important modifications are unlocking the AIM-9M and the AIM-120A, after that, prioritize modifications like G-Suit and all the engine modifications. If you need the F-15C for ground missions, ignore the performance modifications and unlock the GBU-8 guided bombs, however note that the [[Barak II|F-16D Barak II]] is a better aircraft in ground battles than the F-15C.

With its introduction into the Israeli Air Force (IAF) in the mid-1970s, the [[Baz|F-15 ''Baz'']] very quickly became a key component in Israel's regional superiority - providing an umbrella that could not be challenged by any of Israel's belligerent neighbors. Nevertheless, by the 1990s the aircraft was already being threatened by the capabilities of newer Soviet/Russian models of the [[Su-27]] and [[MiG-29]]. Though the Soviet Union was no longer around to supply such aircraft en-masse to Israel's remaining enemies (as it had done in previous decades), Israel's bitter lessons of technological parity during the 1973 Yom Kippur War led to the conclusion that the entire ''Baz'' fleet would have to be replaced in order to maintain a decisive technological edge. With close to a hundred ''Baz'' F-15s already in IAF service, this would be a complicated undertaking.

To make matters even more complicated, the 1990s were also a time of conflict between two separate issues in the air superiority fighter market. On the one hand, while the Americans had already begun funding Israel's defense to the tune of billions of dollars, this came with an exclusivity clause that would force Israel to purchase all of its fighters from the United States. Simultaneously, the United States was at this time heavily invested in development of the F-22 Raptor - which it intended to keep for itself in order to maintain its own technological edge. This left only one air superiority model on the table for Israel to buy: the F-15E Strike Eagle, a highly improved version of the F-15 that could double as a long-range precision bomber.

Fortunately for the IAF, the F-15E was perfectly suited for its purposes. Besides having had plenty of experience with previous F-15 models, the IAF also happened to be in need of a long-range precision bomber to contend with the emerging threat of ballistic missiles from Iraq and Iran. The only problem with the F-15E was that it was still in the process of being introduced into the US Air Force, and was even ''more'' expensive than previous F-15 models. This meant that the IAF would not be able to replace its entire existing F-15 ''Baz'' fleet within any reasonable timeframe. Relying solely on gradual F-15E purchases would leave Israel vulnerable for over a decade - a risk that it could not afford.

The decision was finally made to begin the purchase of F-15Es (which, after intense modification, would become the F-15I ''Ra'am'') while continuing to wait for some newer, cheaper aircraft to be developed by the Americans. However, that alternative never materialized, and by 1995 the IAF had no choice but to create its own alternative: the ''Baz 2000'' program. Building upon two decades of active combat experience with the F-15, and the emergence of a cutting-edge Israeli high-tech industrial sector, the ''Baz 2000'' program would essentially upgrade existing F-15C/Ds into something closer to an F-15E. Additionally, equipment previously featured only on the [[Barak II|F-16 ''Barak'']] would be "married" into this new plane to give it capabilities not yet seen outside the F-16 platform.

This upgrade program resulted in the '''F-15 ''Baz Meshupar''''' (lit. "Improved Baz"), more commonly known by the acronym ''BazMash''. The first such aircraft was rolled out in late 1998, the same year that the first F-15I entered service.

The exact changes made to the ''BazMash'' are still classified, though several are plainly clear from photographs of the aircraft: it has larger conformal fuel tanks allowing for greater range than the original F-15C/D, and its avionics and cockpit have been completely redone. The ''BazMash'' features all-new Multi-Function Displays, contains avionics borrowed from the F-16 ''Barak'' (including DASH helmet integration), and is now capable of using JDAM GPS-guided bombs. It is also capable of carrying Israel's own beyond-visual-range interceptor missiles, the Python 5 and Derby. A radar upgrade has also been mentioned by unofficial sources, but has never been confirmed. It is unclear whether McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing St. Louis) had a hand in making such an upgrade possible, but it seems that every single Israeli military electronics company contributed at least one component to the new plane. Given the number of ''BazMash'' planes that were in service when the ''Baz 2000'' program concluded, some sources have speculated that at least one of these aircraft is in fact an F-15A/B - first upgraded to the F-15C/D standard in the 1980s, and then to the new ''BazMash'' standard.

Despite all of these upgrades, the IAF stated in 2004 that it would still prefer replacing the ''BazMash'' with F-15Is - but additional F-15I purchases ceased around that same time, leaving the IAF with more ''BazMash'' planes than F-15Is to this day. In the mid-2010s, the IAF announced plans to upgrade the ''BazMash'' yet again, with the hope of keeping it in service until the year 2040 - for a total service period of 64 years. Even with the introduction of the F-35I ''Adir'' into IAF service in 2017, the ''BazMash'' in its current form remains Israel's primary air superiority fighter.
