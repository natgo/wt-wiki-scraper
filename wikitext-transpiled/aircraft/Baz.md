In the late 1970s, under the Peace Fox I program, Israel received its first shipment of the latest [[F-15A|F-15A Eagle]] air superiority fighters, and shortly after, the second shipment was temporarily embargoed as a result of the 1982 Lebanon War. However, that did not matter to the Israelis, as even a single F-15 was a landslide advantage in the air wars of the Middle East, making short work of the 30-year-old Syrian MiG-21s that tried to face it. The Israeli F-15A, nicknamed the Baz ("Falcon"), would score the first kill for the F-15 in aerial combat, against a Syrian MiG-21, in 1978, and would start the totem pole of air dominance that defines the F-15's service record. Of the 103+ confirmed aerial kills the F-15 has scored during its service life, Israeli F-15s are responsible for over 80 of them, and the Baz is the concrete starting ground for this long-lasting legacy.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], is Israel's counterpart to the F-15s found in the [[F-15A|American]] and [[F-15J|Japanese]] tech trees. As a result, the Baz plays almost identically to its Eagle brothers in the other trees, with a few minor differences. The main difference, is that unlike the American and Japanese Eagles, the Baz has access to the [[Python 3]] missile, in addition to the usual selection of [[AIM-9L Sidewinder|AIM-9L]] and [[AIM-9M Sidewinder|M]]. The Baz is best played to the same advantages as the other Eagles; do not get too slow, as high-AoA fighters like the [[JAS39A|JAS39]] and the [[Su-27]] will utilize their low speed dogfighting advantages (HMD-slaved missiles and high AoA control) against you. Instead, rely on your own advantages, such as the absurd thrust-to-weight ratio from the powerful engines and the very stable airframe, to set up high-speed engagements in scenarios that favour the Eagle's high speed performance.

'''''Air Realistic Battles'''''

''The F-15A is very capable as a frontline fighter, and has a large number of countermeasures at its disposal in case of any threats. The AIM-9M is likely going to be your primary armament, as the AIM-7M is limited in use. The combination of a very capable platform and IRCCM make the Eagle a deadly fighter. However, you should avoid engaging a group of enemies, as this is where the jet struggles. Even though it retains speed very well, it can easily slow down when backed into a corner. As always, stay with your team and don't head into furballs blindly. Avoid drawn-out dogfights as this can easily lead to a third-party situation, and the off-boresight capability of enemies like the Su-27, JAS-39, J-11, and later MiG-29 variants can best the Eagle even if in the disadvantageous position. The F-14 Tomcat can also be a formidable opponent in BVR combat due to its long-range Phoenix air-to-air missiles that utilizes active-radar homing. The F-15A is no slouch, however, as it can hold its own in a BVR fight. Be sure to pay attention to your RWR and defend accordingly.''

'''''Air Simulator Battles'''''

''In simulator battles, the F-15 is very formidable due to its smokeless AIM-9M air-to-air missiles, but is limited by the seeker range and speed of the AIM-7M. The cockpit allows for excellent visibility and provides great situational awareness to the pilot, but the jet does lack HMD, so you must point your nose at targets. The biggest advantage the F-15A has in a simulator battle is its high speed manoeuvrability and smokeless missiles, allowing for stealthy kills.''

== History ==

One of the contributing factors to Israel's swift and overwhelming victory in the Six-Day War of 1967 was its ability to achieve total air superiority at the very outset, partly due to its pre-emptive strike on its neighbours' air bases, but also thanks to the intensive training of its pilots and the superiority of French and American jet fighter technology at the time. However, the subsequent War of Attrition demonstrated that Israel's enemies â€” and the Soviet Union which supplied them â€” were determined to counter those advantages by any means necessary. During the War of Attrition, Egyptian and Syrian SAM capabilities became a serious headache for the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and the overwhelming mass of MiG and Sukhoi aircraft deployed by Egypt, Syria and the Soviet Union further countered Israel's advantages. To make matters worse, the new MiG-25 high-altitude, high-speed jet was now being used by Israel's enemies to perform recon missions over its territory, which the IAF repeatedly failed to intercept. These problems came to a head during the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when the IAF lost over a dozen aircraft to SAM interceptions alone, and failed repeatedly to secure air superiority over either of its belligerent neighbours.

Despite having only recently purchased a whole slew of [[Kurnass|F-4 Phantom II]]s in the late 60s, and having recently begun producing its own Mirage variants (in the form of the [[Nesher]]), Israel was now forced to modernize its air force yet again to meet these new challenges. The obvious candidates for this modernization effort were the [[F-14A Early|Grumman F-14]] and [[F-15A|McDonnell Douglas F-15]], two of America's newest high-speed, twin-engine air superiority fighters. A committee established to review the two aircraft quickly determined that the F-15 would be the most suitable for Israel's particular needs. Israel was eager to receive the planes as soon as possible, but by 1976 they had barely just entered production to supply the U.S. Airforce. As a result, the Israelis agreed to take four of the existing pre-production planes as part of the first arms deal. Thus, in late 1976, Israel became the first country outside the United States to acquire the F-15. Notably, a delay in the arrival of these planes in Israel on a Friday, December 10, 1976 forced several of the Israeli ministers who had attended the ceremony to break the Sabbath (a mandatory religious day of rest). This resulted in outrage followed by the collapse of the Israeli government, causing a shift of power that has changed Israeli politics ever since.

The reporting name ''Baz'' ("Falcon") was assigned to all F-15 A/B/C/Ds purchased by Israel from 1976 all the way through to the 1990s, regardless of their specific models or configurations, making it more difficult to distinguish between various models. Nevertheless, the IAF has periodically modified older ''Baz'' F-15s to match the specifications of newer ones, making the distinction less relevant. The exact number of F-15s purchased from each model are also unclear. What is known is that Israel has purchased almost as many two-seater models (B and D) as single-seaters (A and C), with the two-seaters being used mostly for training purposes and recon missions.

Aside from the pre-production planes described earlier, most of the initial F-15As and Bs purchased by Israel were from Production Blocks 5 and 6. As with all fighters purchased by Israel since the 1960s, the ''Baz'' was outfitted with several Israeli-made electronic systems, and modified to accept Israeli-made aerial munitions such as the [[Python 3|Python]] and Popeye. Overall, out of all modified Israeli aircraft, the ''Baz'' appears to be closest to the original American model. This changed in the late 1990s, when all ''Baz'' F-15s in the IAF were upgraded further to the ''BazMash'' standard (short for ''Baz Meshupar'', lit. "improved Baz"), and became undeniably different from their American counterparts.

The F-15A was adopted very enthusiastically by Israeli pilots, and quickly became the dominant fighter in the IAF, providing an aerial umbrella that could not be matched by any of its neighbors. This coincided with the peace process between Israel and Egypt, which led to a 1979 treaty between the two countries that radically altered the balance of power in the Middle East. Nevertheless, the Syrian Air Force was not fully deterred, and continued engaging Israel in sporadic battles throughout the end of the 1970s and early 1980s, as the two nations struggled over Syria's increased control of Lebanon. As part of these skirmishes, in 1978 the F-15 scored its world-premier air kill when Israeli pilot Moshe Melnik downed a Syrian MiG-21. Another first for the F-15 and the military aviation world was also scored by a ''Baz'', when one shot down a Syrian MiG-25 for the first time in history.

''Baz'' F-15s continued seeing intense action in Israeli service over the next several years. With the introduction of the F-16 ''Netz'' as Israel's new fighter-bomber in 1980, these two American fighters allowed Israel to perform 'Operation Opera' in 1981: an attack on the Osiraq nuclear reactor near Baghdad, Iraq. Ten ''Baz'' F-15s provided cover for the operation, though no Iraqi aircraft were ultimately scrambled against them. The ''Baz'' F-15's most intense aerial engagement came one year afterwards, when ''Baz'' fighters served as the high-altitude interceptors in Operation Mole Cricket 19, a massive SEAD operation designed to destroy the entire Syrian air defense network along its border with Lebanon. With F-16s and F-4s provoking Syrian aircraft to scramble and engage, the F-15s would swoop down and eliminate them en-masse. During the battle, Israeli F-15s shot down a total of 38 enemy MiG-21s, MiG-23s and MiG-23Ms â€” nearly half the aircraft shot down during the three-day battle â€” while taking no losses of their own. Throughout the course of the First Lebanon War, ''Baz'' F-15s shot down a total of around 80 Syrian aircraft.

From 1976 onward, Israel continued purchasing F-15s of various models for almost twenty years. The last shipment (consisting of older F-15As) was greenlit by Washington thanks to Israel's begrudging agreement not to relatiate against Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. These F-15As came from U.S. Airforce reserve stocks, and were used by the IAF mostly as spare parts for other planes. In 1995, Israel began upgrading its ''Baz'' F-15s to new specifications, with particular attention to all-weather capabilities, improved radar systems, GPS, and network connectivity. At the same time, Israel stopped purchasing any additional ''Baz'' F-15s, and switched entirely to the purchase of new F-15E Strike Eagles from a variant made specifically for their purposes: the F-15I ''Ra'am''. Nevertheless, due to the prohibitive costs of F-15 purchases, and the central role this plane fills in Israel's aerial supremacy, The ''Baz'' continues to serve in the IAF to this day. It is unknown exactly how old the oldest ''Baz'' in service is currently, but it would have to be around 35-40 years old as of 2023, with significant improvements added over the years.
