== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/4976-shop-the-new-e-r-a-bundles-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A"]] and was discontinued from the store after the [[wt:en/news/5488-shop-victory-day-allied-bundles-and-discounts-en|2018 Victory Day]] sales, but returned during [[wt:en/news/5852-special-news-war-thunder-s-birthday-discounts-and-gifts-en|War Thunder's 6th Anniversary]] as a premium purchasable with Golden Eagles {{GE}}.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 8 x 250 kg FAB-250M-46 bombs (2,000 kg total)
* 2 x 450 mm 45-36MAN torpedoes
* 8 x 500 kg FAB-500M-46 bombs (4,000 kg total)

* 2 x 450 mm 45-36MAN torpedoes + 4 x 500 kg FAB-500M-46 bombs (2,000 kg total)

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 23 mm NR-23 cannon, nose turret (100 rpg)
* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, dorsal turret (250 rpg = 500 total)
* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, tail turret (225 rpg = 450 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The best payload for base bombing is the 8 x 500 kg option, allowing you to take out two bases (requiring 4 bombs each). The 2 x 1,500 kg option is rarely recommended (except maybe when airfield bombing) as both bombs drop at once, limiting you to one base or target, and because the total bomb load is also reduced from 4,000 kg to 3,000 kg .

A different approach is to select the airfield spawn (you spawn just above the runway) and the hug the ground, either attacking ground targets or bases (if there are any left). This has the advantage of meaning your team mates will be more likely to cover you (they don't have to climb up to your altitude), and makes you harder to spot for enemy aircraft. It also means enemy aircraft cannot get below you and exploit your blind spot. However you will likely be to slow to kill bases if there are any other bombers on your team (they will get their first). It is also not recommended to bomb the airfield at low altitude as you will be food for the AAA.

Keep a constant lookout and use your potent defensive armament to dispatch of attacking enemy aircraft as quickly as possible.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good, destructive defensive armament
* Good bomb load (can kill two bases in RB)
* Turns fairly well
* Has two pilots (less chance of them being killed)
* Can land on water
* Can take a reasonable amount of damage

'''Cons:'''

* Drops bombs in pairs halving number of targets you can hit (i.e. 8 bombs gives you 4 drops)
* Big target
* Engines are exposed and liable to be set on fire
* Turrets can not cover underneath
* Not the most stable of bombing platforms
* Lack of landing gear can make re-arming interesting on some maps (still possible but harder)
* Large control surfaces make big targets
* Fairly slow
* Very poor roll rate
* Not much ammo for the turrets

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The first prototype of the Be-6 flew in 1945, only a couple years after the initial plans for the new Soviet flying boat were laid down in 1943. Evaluation of the first prototype showed that the aircraft could be improved in some areas to achieve better performance. Thus, Beriev engineers equipped the following model, that would become the production version, with more powerful Shvetsov ASh-73 engines and changed the defensive armaments layout from six 12.7 mm UBT machine guns to 23 mm NR-23 cannons, followed by the reduction in turret count from 5 to 3. This improved variant had its maiden flight in 1951, with serial production following shortly after.

After its introduction to service in 1951, the Be-6 was tasked with performing various roles fitted for a maritime aircraft, such as reconnaissance, sub-hunting, patrolling, transportation and mine-laying. The aircraft enjoyed a long service life thanks to the fact that significant changes within the Soviet navy, at least when float planes were concerned, were few and far between during the Cold War. However, the Be-6 didn't only serve with the Soviet Union. The Chinese also received a number of Be-6s for their naval air force. The Be-6 remained in active military service with the Soviet Union until the late 1960's, and up to the 1990's with the Chinese Naval Air Force, thanks to modernization efforts. The Chinese changed, among other things, the powerplant of the Be-6 to the WJ-6 turboprop and redesignated the Be-6 to the Qing-6. A total of around 120 Be-6s were produced between 1949 - 1957.
