== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Direct Hit"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season V, "River Hunter"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 1 mm steel plates behind engines
- 25 mm steel plate in the nose
- 25 mm steel plate located in rear fuselage (in front of gunner's legs)
- 38 mm bulletproof glass in frontal cockpit window
  \*\* Self-sealing fuel tanks (3 in each wing)

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Vickers S (40 mm)|Rolls-Royce Type BH (40 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 1 x 40 mm Vickers S cannon, chin-mounted, left (16 rpg)
- 1 x 40 mm Rolls-Royce Type BH cannon, chin-mounted, right (12 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Devastating armament which heavily damages or destroys most planes with one successful hit
- Gets an air spawn
- Good top speed in a dive
- Thanks to its ability to mount AP-T shells, it can be used for tank-busting
- Using weapon selection, guns can be fired separately (better ammo conservation)

'''Cons:'''

- Slow compared to planes it frequently faces
- Struggles to intercept bombers due to poor climb rate
- Lacks any defensive armament
- Very small ammo pool

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

By 1941, 20 Beaufighters were reserved solely for testing. The 4th prototype, ''R2055'', was modified by replacing its standard armament with 2 40 mm guns. The gun mounted on the port fuselage was a Rolls-Royce BH, and the starboard fuselage gun was a Vickers S. The trials involving ''R2055'' eventually lead to the the development of an anti-tank Hawker Hurricane Mk IID, mounting 2 of the Vickers guns tested on the Beaufighter.<ref>Moyes 1966, pp. 5, 11, 13</ref>
