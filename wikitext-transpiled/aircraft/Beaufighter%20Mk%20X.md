== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, belly-mounted (283 rpg = 1,132 total)

{{main|RP-3|18 inch Mark XII (450 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 1 x 18 inch Mark XII torpedo
- 8 x RP-3 rockets

=== Defensive armament ===

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Vickers K (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 7.7 mm Vickers K machine gun, dorsal turret (1,000 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Just like the [[Beaufighter Mk VIc|Mk VIc]] version of the Beaufighter, you can use this aircraft in a variety of roles. Heavy fighter, torpedo bomber, and attacker are all still viable roles for this aircraft. The big difference is in how effective you are at these roles. In the ground attack role, you see a large improvement in capabilities. This is mainly due to the additional ability to carry rockets for ground attack, and the increase in 20 mm cannon ammo. Torpedo bomber tactics should be avoided, however. With the torpedo on offer still being very poor in terms of drop requirements, surviving against incoming flak will be a real challenge. Heavy fighter tactics can be used once again, but with a few changes. Compared to the Mk VIc, you pack a much bigger punch with your weaponry. Unfortunately, this adds weight to the airframe. Thanks to the extra weight, climb rate, manoeuvrability, and speed will all suffer. In short, you will find it harder to find and catch targets, but you can shoot them down more easily. Overall, stick to relatively low altitude. Go after ground targets whenever you see the opportunity and attack any bombers operating at low altitude the second they show up. In order to ensure effectiveness in this role, ground target or universal ammo belts should be used with the 20 mm cannons. The same applies to your 7.7 mm machine guns ammo belts; armoured or universal should be used. With a good flight escort, you can take give your opponents a lot of trouble attacking their ground units, ultimately helping to secure victory for your team.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Excellent armament consisting of four Hispano Mk II cannons and six 7.7 mm machine guns
- Very likely to come out on top during a head-on attack
- Can actually intercept bombers, provided they are flying low enough
- Center-lined cannon armament makes them much more accurate and easier to aim
- Good horizontal agility
- Very good ammo amount, especially helpful during RB and SB
- Can carry 8 powerful RP-3 rockets, with 60 mm of penetration
- Can be used as a torpedo-bomber

'''Cons:'''

- Mediocre climb rate
- Machine guns' accuracy suffers from wing mounting (convergence)
- Bad roll rate at high speeds
- Gunner is almost useless due to only having a single machine gun for defensive armament
- Cannot carry any bombs, which makes it harder to destroy pillboxes and heavier tanks

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
A design rapidly born from the wings and tail of the earlier Beaufort, the Beaufighter was a two seat, twin engine heavy fighter designed for long range, ground strike and night fighter duties. Equipped with an early AI radar, the Beaufighter was one of the world's first successful night fighters.

Most of the last mass-produced aircraft in Britain were Beaufighter TF Mk Xs. This model was a logical continuation and development of the Mk VIC, had two Hercules Mk VI engines optimised for low level flight, and could carry the standard torpedoes produced in Britain and the United States. The TF letters in the designation stood for "Torpedo Fighter". The aircraft could also carry a bomb load of 1,100 kg, and with the help of an AI Mk.VIII radar installed in a 'thimble' nose, they were highly capable machines employed in detecting and destroying surface shipping. In the Far East the Beaufighter was reputed to be nicknamed 'Whispering Death' by Japanese soldiers, although some modern historians believe this to be Allied propaganda.

In March 1945, over a period of 48 hours, Beaufighter TF Mk Xs of No 236 and No 254 Squadrons found and destroyed five German submarines.

The last major variant of the Beaufighter, over 2200 were built in Britain.
