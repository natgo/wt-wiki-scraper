== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"|Update 1.49 (aka 1.70.1945) "Weapons of Victory"]]. The Bf 109 B-1 is the first of the fabled 109s that make up the bulk of the German fighter forces in War Thunder. Used in combat in the Spanish Civil War, the B-1 allowed the Germans to acquire valuable combat experience and develop the Bf 109s further.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

Despite having no armour protection or self-sealing fuel tanks, this aircraft can surprisingly survive inflicted damage. The first part of the aircraft that you will most likely lose is the engine. The engine is great for soaking up incoming rounds especially from head-on attacks or gunners on bombers. When fighting biplanes and other early tier aircraft, their bullets are not very effective unless they are close enough or aimed to target the vital components. Luckily, a majority of early tier pilots are just starting out and may not be good at aiming. Coupled with good evasive manoeuvres this aircraft can survive long enough to escape low-powered planes: saving your life.

{{main|MG 17 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Against fighters that are able to tank quite a few 7.92 mm, the best option to quickly dispatch an enemy is to aim specifically for the pilot.

Against bombers, the Bf 109 B-1 performs poorly. When engaging, aim for the engine or pilot. Due to its bigger hit box, the engine is the preferable of the two. This could cause an engine/fuel tank fire, making the task all the easier. Remember that propellers often take some time to stop spinning, so don't be misled into firing all you have into a single engine, a few good bursts will do the trick just nicely. Alternate to the other engines once you feel like the previous one had enough. Picking of the gunners might also allow you to stay behind the bomber, littering a certain area/ engine. However, this calls for some good shots and a loss of valuable time if you don't get them in your initial pass.

'''Realistic Battles'''

The Bf 109 B-1 is a strong performer in RB. It doesn't have the absolutely stellar climb of later 109s, but gets up to altitude easily enough. Its biggest asset is its incredible high speed turn, which can comfortably cut inside of other planes' turning circles, especially in a high speed engagement. If you drag on the fight for too long though, you will lose your advantage. However, due to mainly fighting biplanes and other early monoplanes, you can use your speed to reset the engagement in your favour. The biggest drawback of this plane is the armament - it will take a lot of time on target to down or critically damage an enemy. Like other 109s, the roll rate is subpar and requires use of the rudder to be put to its full potential.

'''Simulator Battles'''

In Simulator, the Bf 109 B-1 is quite a friendly fighter that fights well. It offers great flight performance with its smooth handling, adequate speed against biplanes, and impressive climb rate and turn rate. Its nose-mounted MGs have lots of ammo and do not require any convergence setting, making it very easy to aim. The nose gently slopes down from the windscreen, offering great over-the-nose vision. Despite having a razorback, the B model actually has great visibility towards the tail, increasing the pilot's situational awareness. Finally, the engine is not as powerful as the later models, making takeoff easier. However the B model does suffer from poor firepower given by the mere 2 x 7.92 mm MGs. Shooting windows in SB are way smaller than in RB, which reduces its effectiveness even more.

Bring at least 30 minutes of fuel for prolonged patrolling and fighting. The convergence does not really matter, it might be anywhere between 250-600 m. You can also set keys for vertical head movement, as lifting up your head a little helps improving the over-the-nose visibility.

Dogfighting in SB involves everyday RB tactics. Utilise common manuevers such as Immelmann, Split-S, scissor, barrel roll, etc. Note: the Bf 109 handles very sluggishly in the roll axis at low speed, so take this into account if dogfighting at low speed/altitude. You can even pull the elevator fully for maximum agility, but only if you pull gently and gradually will the 109 manoeuvre as you wish. If maximum elevator input is harsh and sudden, the plane will start swaying around and enter a flat spin. The aircraft can quite easily recover from a flat spin by fully deflecting elevators downward and rudder to the opposite side of which the plane is spinning, and wait until it starts a dive and gather some speed to pull up.

Landing may need practice for some. It is easy at first: decelerate and descent towards the runway, deploy combat, takeoff, landing flaps and gears in order, fly at ~230 km/h before touchdown. If the plane bounces up with landing flaps, use takeoff/combat flaps instead to reduce lift. Note that you must align the plane with the airstrip correctly prior to touchdown and do not yaw/break one side too much when breaking, as the main landing gears are so close together that they cannot support such sideways force, causing the plane to wobble dangerously or even tilt towards one side, striking a wingtip into the ground.

====Specific enemies worth noting====

<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->

The Bf 109 B-1 runs the risk of meeting [[Hurricane_(Family)|Hurricanes]], a plane introduced to the [[:Category:Britain_aircraft|RAF]] in 1935 that has a far heavier armament and shorter snap turns. Against better performing enemies, the Bf 109 B-1 is not hopeless, but it will be tough. It is not exactly sturdy and will be quickly stitched to death by heavily armed enemies. Here, manoeuvrability is key, allowing you to roll out of an incoming attack quickly, setting up overshoots to keep the enemy at bay. A surprising number of players will lose their patience in such moments, making mistakes and thus nullifying their performance advantage. Nearly all planes of superior performance turn worse than a B-1, so if you manage to bleed their speed and pull them to the deck, you will be able to win a turning engagement. However, keep a watchful eye for better turning enemies such as biplanes.

====Counter-tactics====

<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->

The Bf 109 B-1 is going to be a rude awakening for those that flock to the 109s due to their historic reputation. While a capable pre-war fighter, it is severely lacking in firepower. Its two [[MG 17 (7.92 mm)|MG 17]]s 7.92 mm are just about adequate when engaging biplanes or [[I-16 type 5|I-16]]s, but lack punch against tougher opponents such as [[Hurricane Mk I/L|Hawker Hurricanes]]. Just about any enemy you might meet has either comparable or better armament.

What the plane lacks in firepower, it makes up in manoeuvrability, with the later trademark Bf 109 energy fighting capabilities displayed. A capable pilot can make this aircraft dance like any Messerschmitt, but it requires discipline, precision and effective use of the two MG 17's. When engaging planes that are of the Spanish Civil War Era, the B-1 does best by using its speed and superior climb rate to place itself into an advantageous attack position, and then launching one concentrated attack after the other on its target. Remember to always recycle your speed into altitude and back as the fight progresses. Before zoom climbing back up from an attack, remember to extend a little bit to avoid getting picked off from a prop-hang. As you zoom up, check your surroundings to keep good situational awareness.

The Bf 109 B-1 came out of the prototype V series of the Bf 109s and saw combat in the Spanish Civil War. While the Bf 109s faced various performance and reliability issues from their engine to an obvious lack of "punch", the experience proved to yield valuable data allowing for design improvement, ensuring the success of later Bf 109 models.

While the B-1 was the only production model of the 109 carrying the "Bertha" designation, later models that saw improvements to the variable pitch carried the unofficial designation of B-2.

A notable feature of the Bf 109 B-1 is its massive opening in the cowling. While production models carried a third MG 17 firing out of said cowling, this was nearly always removed after combat trials during the Spanish Civil War. Although the fixed gun was cooled by the air coming in through the hole, it proved unreliable and a detriment to the plane. The in-game Bf 109 B-1 does not have this MG 17.
