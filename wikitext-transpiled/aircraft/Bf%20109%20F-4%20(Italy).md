== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season X, "Royal Guard"]].

The plane is painted after the camouflage scheme of Hungarian Pilot Dezső Szentgyörgyi, who was the highest-scoring Hungarian fighter ace of the Royal Hungarian Honvéd Air Force in World War II.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
''In the hands of a good pilot and employing energy fighting tactics this aircraft can outfly and outmanoeuvre most of the prop planes it faces even at higher battle ratings during up-tier situations due to its low energy loss in turns, high acceleration, high sustained climb rate and low stall speed. It is slower than the later model 109s but it has a better turn rate. The Bf 109 can fly very well at the deck and at high altitude making it a complete energy fighter.''

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Bf 109 F-4, although a small plane, is a sturdy plane that can survive a lot of damage and retain much of its manoeuvrability when damaged. Its self-sealing fuel tanks increase the chance to put out a fire.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 17 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm MG 151 cannon, nose-mounted (200 rpg)
* 2 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|SC50JA (50 kg)|Flam C 250 incendiary|SC250JA (250 kg)|MG 151 (15 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 4 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (200 kg total)
* 1 x 250 kg SC250JA bomb (250 kg total)
* 1 x Flam C 250 incendiary bomb
* 2 x 15 mm MG 151 cannons (125 rpg = 250 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Nimble, compared to Soviet and American counterparts
* The 20 mm Minengeschoß shells are lethal because of their high explosive mass 
* Very good climb rate, possibly as good as a Spitfire or a maxed-out P-39 Airacobra
* Good sustained turn
* Faster than most opponents, such as the Spitfire Mk V, Yak-3, and La-5, especially at altitude
* Good performance at medium altitudes
* Better than the F-4 tropical variant due to engine power
* The 15 mm cannons have quite high penetration with the armoured targets belt. They are very effective against soft ground targets
* All weaponry mounted in the nose, allowing easy aiming without having to worry about convergence
* Flaps tighten turn radius significantly, can win duels against most planes that aren't turnfighters
* Access to incendiary bombs

'''Cons:'''

* Engine overheats quickly
* Additional armament reduces flight performance, especially critical in a dogfight
* Poor cockpit visibility in Simulator mode due to numerous canopy frames and razorback, greatly limiting the all-round view
* Prone to catching fire when chasing bombers
* Gun pods can't load stealth belts, thus giving the user away in a surprise attack
* Turns sluggishly at speeds under 190 km/h
* Priority target when in Arcade mode due to its reputation of destroying planes with ease, especially when equipped with MG 151/15 gun pods in addition to the offensive armament of MG 17 machine guns and an MG 151/20 cannon, experienced players will often try to eliminate the Bf 109 F-4 as soon as possible.
* Gun pods have low ammo count, compared to the 20 mm MG 151 gun pods accessible to the G-2 variant
* In Simulator mode the huge engine torque causes severe turning when taking off which can lead to a crash
* Flaps deploy and retract slowly, requires practice to use well
