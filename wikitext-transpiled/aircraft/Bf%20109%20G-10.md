== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

Not very different from the Bf 109 Fs and other Bf 109 G variants, the G-10 can only be readily identified by its paint scheme. Unfortunately, the other camouflage (I./JG 27) can be mistaken for a Bf 109 G-6 but can be differed from a Bf-109 K-4. Unlike the G-2 and the K-4, the tailwheel is not retractable, however, any resulting drag is negligible.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
[[File:Cockpit_Bf109g10.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Bf 109 G-10's instrument panel.]]
The Bf 109 G-10 is a 109 that does not change very much in terms of gameplay. It fits in between the Bf 109 G-14 and K-4. It's a well versed universal fighter being able to perform well both in dogfights and hit-and-run tactics.

Bf 109 G-10 behaves like most other 109 models, a battle-tested universal fighter, being able to perform most tasks that it will face. The G-10 can take 2 additional 20 mm [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151]] gunpods, or 30 mm MK 108 gunpods, to increase its firepower over fighters, as well as the tougher attackers and bombers. However, equipping these will come at a cost of speed, manoeuvrability and climb ability, they don't affect the plane heavily but can be costly if the 109 G-10 gets into a disadvantageous situation. However, the extra firepower will deal with most enemies swiftly and if properly used, the Bf 109 G-10 can be a dangerous foe.

One of the best tactics is to use the aircraft's decent climb rate to get above most of the enemy team. This could be American fighters, however, Spitfires will be the most likely enemy to outclimb the Bf 109 G-10. The best tactic to attack enemies below is to dive on them (Boom and Zoom), if they turn, pull up immediately to maintain your altitude advantage, and reduce the risk of the enemy getting guns on target. Another good tactic to use would be to fly over an enemy and try bait them to climb up. When they do this, fly away to gain some distance and do a large circle around them. It is crucial that one keeps distance to the target as it could end up with the G-10 being attacked while it is turning and will be easily shot down if it's too close. After a couple of seconds, the enemy aircraft will likely stall from trying to climb, it gives the G-10 an opportunity to shoot the plane down. It is important to avoid using this manoeuvre with Spitfires as they will likely be able to climb up to the G-10's altitude and shoot it down before they stall. If a Spitfire is above the Bf 109 G-10 and tries to dive on the G-10, perform a split S to avoid it, if it follows pull back the throttle and wait for its zoom climb to shoot him down in the back, but it will most likely rip the wings or enter a G-force induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC).

Bf 109 G-10 is not only able to fight for air superiority, it's also able to carry a single [[SC250JA (250 kg)]] to be able to deal with most ground units, being able to drop the bomb swiftly and accurately on its target. Bf 109 G-10s can easily achieve air superiority for the team if properly used in ground battle games, covering the team from enemy fighters and bombers which can change the outcome of the battle. It can also do CAS (Close Air Support) to protect allied vehicles from either a superior enemy or a dug down enemy.

The Variable-speed supercharger allows for Bf 109s to maintain maximum engine power at enemy fighter supercharger gear switch altitudes. At these heights, an enemy plane will be either gain no benefit from WEP or be forced to prematurely switch to the next gear, which draws more power from the engine to drive the compressor. Supercharger gear switch varies from plane to plane (as well as with airspeed and temperature), but typically is between 3,500-4,500 m for Spitfires, P-51s, and F4U-4Bs.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent acceleration and high top speed, even at extreme altitudes
* Excellent climb rate, even stock
* Improved high-altitude performance over earlier Bf 109s, improved supercharger can maintain maximum boost with WEP to ~7,000 m
* Variable-speed supercharger eliminates "weak altitudes" between gear changes seen in allied fighters. Engine power is consistent
* Can WEP for 5 minutes non-stop until it reaches ~100°C (212°F)
* 20 minutes of MW-50 available for WEP
* WEP fuel load is close to the engine fuel load
* Engine cools down very quickly at 0% throttle
* Great dive acceleration, better than most opponents it faces
* Can pull high-G manoeuvres
* Armament is interchangeable between a heavy 30 mm Mk 108 and a lighter 20 mm MG 151 with more ammunition
* All weaponry mounted in the nose, allowing easy aiming without having to worry about convergence

'''Cons:'''

* Poor sustained turn radius
* Tends to be out-climbed/outrun by post-war aircraft, many late/post-war Allied props wholly outperform it at low altitudes
* Low rip speed — combined with the excellent dive acceleration, this plane can quickly reach unsafe speeds in dive
* Ammunition can run out really quickly for the Mk 108s
* Flight performance drastically decreases with under-wing gondola pods
* Requires skill to play efficiently
* Can face F8F Bearcats and Griffon Spitfires, which can be superior in certain situations
* For Sim, the numerous canopy frames and razorback greatly limit the all-round view, and huge engine torque causes severe turning when taking off

The Bf 109 G-10 was a variant of the already successful Bf 109 series. The G-10 was the combination of a Bf 109 G airframe with a DB605 D-2 Engine, the aircraft was built in the factories of Erla, WNF, and Messerschmitt Regensburg. Even though being called a G-10, the aircraft was in production after the G-14, the sole purpose was to produce a fighter better than the G-14 until the K-4 could take its place.

'''Variants'''

*G-10 (Light fighter with DB605DM or DB/DC engine)
*G-10/R2 (Reconnaissance fighter)
*G-10/R6 (Bad-weather fighter with PKS 12 autopilot)
*G-10/U4 (As G-10 but with 30 mm/1.18 in MK 108 Motorkanone engine cannon)

The Messerschmitt Bf 109 was a single-seat monoplane fighter used by the Luftwaffe before and during WWII. It was used as a fighter, interceptor, high-altitude interceptor, fighter-bomber and reconnaissance aircraft.

By early Spring 1944, the Bf 109 G-10 variant had replaced the Bf 109 G-6 in mass-production, being powered by the DB 605D engine with an improved supercharger. Without external pylons, and powered by the DB 605DC, the G-10 was the fastest Bf-109G variant, with a weight of 3,100 kg and top speeds of 550 km/h at sea level and 680 km/h at 7,400 m. It could reach 6,000 m in 5.8 minutes.

Unfortunately, the Bf 109 G-10 would usually reach the front line with factory-installed Ruestsatz armament kits. For example, the Bf 109 G-10/R1 had an ETC fuselage bomb rack for one 250-kg or 4 x 50-kg bombs, a bomb selector switch and a 5 mm armour plating under the oil tank. The Bf 109 G-10/R2 with DB 605DB was a reconnaissance variant with the 13 mm guns removed and with one Rb 50/30 or 75/30 camera. With a takeoff weight of 3,300 kg (including a 300-litre drop tank) the recon variant could reach 645 km/h at 9,000 m; it had a range of 840 km at a speed of 620 km/h and at an altitude of 8,300 m. The Bf 109 G-10/R14 with DB 605D had a pair of 30 mm MK 108 cannon in underwing gondolas. The Bf 109 G-10/R6 was similar to the R14, but with the gondolas housing 20 mm MG 151s.
