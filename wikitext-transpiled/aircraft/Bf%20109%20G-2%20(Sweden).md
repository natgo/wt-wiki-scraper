== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Great climb rate compared to foes like [[P-47D-23-RA (China)|P-47D]], [[P-51D-10|P-51D]]
- Fast acceleration thanks to small airframe
- Decently manoeuvrable, can dogfight clumsier planes like the [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]]
- 20mm HE shells are destructive against similar planes (e.g. [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]], [[P-51]], [[A6M5]])
- Nose-mounted guns are beginner-friendly to aim especially in simulator
- Able to carry bombs, effectively acting as a multi-role aircraft
- Can carry 2 x 20 mm gunpods for bomber-hunting

'''Cons:'''

- Inadequate turning ability at all speeds compared to agile opponents (e.g. [[A6M (Family)|A6M]], [[Yak-3 (Family)|Yak-3]], [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]])
- Poor high speed performance, disadvantaged against high-speed fighters like [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]], [[P-38 (Family)|P-38]]
- 20 mm cannon has rather limited ammo, trigger discipline is required
- Overall fragile structure and light armour, cannot take any hits
- Engine overheats easily when constantly engaging WEP
- Cockpit visibility is heavily obstructed by nose, razorback and framing
