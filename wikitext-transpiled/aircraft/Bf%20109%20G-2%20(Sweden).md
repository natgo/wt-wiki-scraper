== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. The ▄Bf 109 G-2 along with the G-6 was used by the Finnish Air Force between 1943 and 1954. It shares near identical flight performance to the [[Bf_109_G-2/trop|German G-2/trop variant]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The ▄Bf 109 G-2 shares nearly identical flight performance with its German counterpart.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 60 mm Bulletproof glass in front of the pilot.
* 4-8 mm Steel plates on pilot seat.
* 10 mm Steel plates around the pilot's head.
* 21 mm Steel plate on the rear of the fuel tank, with 4 mm plates surrounding it on other sides.

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 17 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm MG 151 cannon, nose-mounted (200 rpg)
* 2 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|SC50JA (50 kg)|SC250JA (250 kg)|Flam C 250 incendiary|MG 151 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 4 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (200 kg total)
* 1 x 250 kg SC250JA bomb (250 kg total)
* 1 x Flam C 250 incendiary bomb
* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons (135 rpg = 270 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Bf 109 G-2 was designed as a fighter aircraft and thus excels in the role of it. It reaches its maximal performance with of course no secondary weapons equipped. However, if one 20 mm MG 151/20 is not sufficient, especially against bombers, utilising two extra MG 151/20 in form of gunpods will noticeably increase firepower at the expense of a slight loss in flight performance.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great climb rate compared to foes like [[P-47D-23-RA (China)|P-47D]], [[P-51D-10|P-51D]]
* Fast acceleration thanks to small airframe
* Decently manoeuvrable, can dogfight clumsier planes like the [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]]
* 20mm HE shells are destructive against similar planes (e.g. [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]], [[P-51]], [[A6M5]])
* Nose-mounted guns are beginner-friendly to aim especially in simulator
* Able to carry bombs, effectively acting as a multi-role aircraft
* Can carry 2 x 20 mm gunpods for bomber-hunting

'''Cons:'''

* Inadequate turning ability at all speeds compared to agile opponents (e.g. [[A6M (Family)|A6M]], [[Yak-3 (Family)|Yak-3]], [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]])
* Poor high speed performance, disadvantaged against high-speed fighters like [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]], [[P-38 (Family)|P-38]]
* 20 mm cannon has rather limited ammo, trigger discipline is required
* Overall fragile structure and light armour, cannot take any hits
* Engine overheats easily when constantly engaging WEP
* Cockpit visibility is heavily obstructed by nose, razorback and framing

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In 1942, Finland started negotiations with Germany about the purchase of fighter aircraft for the Finnish Air Force. In December of the same year, an agreement was found and 30 Bf-109 G-2's were bought by Finland and by January 1943 the Bf-109 G-2's were assigned to a freshly redesigned No.34 Squadron (LeLv 34) being led by Major Olavi Ehrnroot. 17 Finnish Pilots were sent to retrieve the fighters, 16 G-2's were flown back to Finland in the March of 1943. The rest of the purchased fighters were retrieved in the May of the same year. In 1944, 30 more fighters were purchased, including [[Bf_109_G-6_Erla_(Sweden)|G-6]] and G-8 variants.
