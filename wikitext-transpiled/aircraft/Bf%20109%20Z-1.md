== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/3071--en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] and was removed from the Gaijin store after [[wt:en/news/5865-special-big-war-thunder-birthday-sale-en|War Thunder's 6th Anniversary sale]]. It was then made available briefly in the store during the [[wt:en/news/5976-special-shop-war-thunder-winter-sale-en|2018 Winter sale]] and for the [[wt:en/news/7710-special-maiden-flight-of-the-bf-109-en|2022 "Maiden flight of the Bf 109"]] event.

The Bf 109 "Zwilling" (German for "twin") is quite literally two BF 109 Fs assembled together. Featuring a quartet of the MK 108 Maschinenkanonen, also nicknamed "Sledgehammer" due to the firing sound, mounted in the middle of the plane, it is capable of shredding anything in its sights.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Zwilling shares similar characteristics to the American [[F-82E|F-82 ''Twin Mustang'']], which also so happens to be two of the same plane super-sized and put together. However, two of the main differences is the lack of two cockpits and two pilots and a significantly more powerful armament.

While being significantly heavier, it is still a Messerschmitt and boasts an above-average manoeuvrability for a heavy fighter and high speed due to its twin DB 605's. However, it is significantly less manoeuvrable against single-engined props that it will face, so it is not recommended to turn fight unless they are considerably less manoeuvrable than you.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm steel - pilot's seat
* 10 mm steel behind and above pilot's head
* 60 mm bulletproof glass in front of pilot
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 behind pilot, 1 in right fuselage, 2 in "middle wing", 1 in each wing)

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|MK 108 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 30 mm MK 108 cannons; 2x Inline with Nose Props, 2x Exterior Wings (65 rpg = 260 total)

The MK 108 is a very bad anti-fighter weapon particularly in fighter to fighter combat. Bullet drop and slow velocity result in a severe difficulty leading shots at ranges above 300 m (350 yds). In dogfights where both aircraft are constantly turning and changing direction, this trait gets even worse. The high speeds of the late props push the necessary lead for hitting the target high and very far in front of the enemy. Training with this weapon system in a custom battle against random enemies is heavily advised.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|SC250JA (250 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 1 x 250 kg SC250JA bomb (250 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Zwilling sits at a rather uncomfortable spot as a heavy fighter, it's fast in a straight line and it climbs well, however the plane doesn't have much else going for it. You will only win a dogfight to an F-82, you will not stand a chance against single engined fighters and you have to reserve the plane to a very passive playstyle in order to capitalize on the pros of the plane. 

However, where the Zwilling really shines is as a bomber interceptor. The large bodies of bombers make it so that the MK 108's drop isn't as problematic, and the off-centre pilot makes it harder for their gunners to land a shot on your pilot. At the start of a match, climb to bomber altitude (4k-6k metres) and start hunting for prey. If all of the bombers have been destroyed, or there weren't any to begin with, you are safe to use it as a Boom-&-Zoomer or an air superiority fighter.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely destructive armament mounting the dreaded ''Minengeschoss''
* Quite speedy
* Powerful DB 605s allow it to reach high speeds
* Decent high altitude performance
* Exceptional interceptor
* Solid dive speed

'''Cons:'''

* MK 108s have an extremely slow travel time and drastic bullet drop
* Increased weight make it harder to manoeuvre with
* Easy prey for more nimble and heavily armed single-engined fighters
* Sluggish handling at lower speeds and altitudes
* Rudder locks up making aiming virtually impossible at high speeds 
* Sluggish roll rate means that trying to hit anyone who is actively manoeuvring is a challenge 
* Has a tendency to catch fire when hit due to the fuel tank that is positioned where the other pilot should be 
* Gun arrangement makes hitting small targets hard, two guns are mounted in both noses and on the outer wings. This means that the 109Z has one of the biggest spreads on any plane in the game (Could be seen as a pro for attacking bombers)

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
With the start of allied bombing campaigns against German strategic targets in 1942, the Luftwaffe was forced to go onto the defensive for the first time in the war. This sudden turn of events sparked an urgent demand for new heavy fighter and interceptor designs that would counter the ever increasing onslaught of allied bombers and their respective escorts. Although the Messerschmitt company was already working on such a new aircraft that would replace the dated Bf 110 - the Me 210 - several problems during development delayed the project's completion. As a result, new versions of the Bf 110 had to be developed to counter the new threat. However, the RLM (German Air Ministry) wasn't content with the creation of even more modifications of the aircraft as they planned to decrease the amount of different variants for all aircraft in service at the time in hopes of addressing logistical problems that strained production. Inspired by the previous He-111 "Zwilling" project, Messerschmitt engineers began work on a similar alternative heavy fighter based on the Bf 109, that could easily be mass produced and offer better performance (in reference speed) than the Bf 110 already in service, whilst at the same time being cheaper to manufacture than newly designed machines.

By taking two standard Bf 109Fs from the assembly line and "welding" them together, Messerschmitt engineers created what would become known as the Bf 109Z-0 - the first prototype of the "zwilling" Bf 109. In 1943 however, a bombing raid of one of the Messerschmitt plants near Augsburg led to the destruction of the prototype, cancelling the planned tests. Despite this setback, the engineers kept working on the concept and less than a year later, in spring 1944, a new Z-1 prototype, based off the Bf 109G-6, was created. The second prototype differed from the first one, apart from being based on a later variant of the 109, in the abandoning of rifle-calibre guns in favor of interchangeable large-calibre autocannons, a common trend for late-war German machines. In the end, the project was ultimately cancelled as resource shortages began afflicting the German industry in the final stages of the war and the concept of a twin Bf 109 fighter was abandoned for good.
