== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in the [[wt:en/news/6293/current|Operation H.E.A.T event]] during [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]]. It is a rare vehicle and can be obtained through the [https://trade.gaijin.net/? Gaijin Marketplace].

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 8.5-10.5 mm Steel plates in front of the cockpit
- 5.5 mm Steel plate under the pilot
- 8-10.5 mm Steel plate behind the pilot
- 6 mm Steel plate under defensive gunner
- 8.5 mm Steel plate in front of defensive gunner

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 1 x 30 mm MK 101 cannon, chin-mounted (60 rpg)
- 4 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, nose-mounted (1,000 rpg = 4,000 total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, dorsal turret (750 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Bf 110 C-6 is best suited at ground attack and bomber interception roles. The 30 mm chin-mounted cannon can load both HVAP and HE rounds giving it flexibility in both Air RB and Ground RB. The Bf 110 C-6 can intercept bombers, destroy tanks and pillboxes with its 30 mm cannon but struggles in dogfights with fighters unless it had the altitude/energy advantage. The lack of 20 mm cannons leaves the C-6 nothing to fall back on except four machine guns. The C-6 is a great ground attacker in ground battles as the 30 mm cannon can penetrate most tanks at its rank.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- 30 mm chin-mounted cannon with HVAP or HE shells and 60 rounds
- 30 mm HVAP is a very capable tank killer
- Very manoeuvrable compared to other German attackers at the rank
- Flight performance are barely affected when compared to the 110 C-7
- Four 7.92 machine guns with 1,000 RPG
- Sturdy airframe and high survivability
- Armoured around the pilot and gunner

'''Cons:'''

- Lacks 20 mm cannons found on other Bf 110s
- Cannot carry bombs or rockets
- Slow acceleration and poor energy retention
- Large target
- Single 7.92 mm MG 15 dorsal turret with a limited cone of fire
- Large elevator is a large but somewhat durable target when cannons aren't involved
- Lacks armoured glass windscreen, increasing chances of pilot being injured from head-ons

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Bf 110 C-6 is a twin-engine heavy attack aircraft developed according to a special programme whose objective was to outfit the Bf 110 fighters with a heavy cannon armament. This modification came into existence in the spring of 1939. The aircraft was designed to be equipped with a 30 mm MK 101 cannon, while its standard-issue 20 mm cannons were dismantled for the purposes of reducing the weight and increasing fuselage space. A series of issues concerning the manufacturing of the MK 101 cannons led to the postponement of the project, but in the summer of 1940, the German government placed an order to assemble a test batch consisting of 12 C-6 aircraft. All the fighters in this batch were deployed in the Battle of France as anti-tank aircraft, as well as in the Battle of Britain to combat enemy ships and destroy enemy radars.
