== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===

* 2 x 7.92 mm MG 81 machine guns, dorsal turret (750 rpg = 1,500 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This plane plays mostly like [[Bf 110 G-2|its predecessor]], but it has the added bonus of a search radar and a pair of upwards firing MG FF/M cannons. This plane is also slightly slower and climbs worse due to the drag of the search radar and the extra radar operator. A strategy for experienced pilots is to turn the plane upside down and use the upwards firing guns to strafe ground targets, just remember to pull up in time! This plane is like a fusion between the [[Bf 110 G-2]] and the [[Do 217 N-2]]. You can use strategies used on both planes on this aircraft but less effectively. Watch out for enemies that can out-turn you, have a better climb than you, or if there are a horde of them.

=== Radars ===
{{main|FuG-220}}

The Bf 110 G-4 is equipped with a [[FuG-220]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft; a control box which is part of the radar damage model is located behind the pilot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great variety of payload options of bombs, gunpods, and rockets
* Very powerful standard armament
* Has Schräge Musik cannons for varied gameplay
* Can carry powerful Wfr.Gr.21 rockets
* Can carry the large SC1000L2 bomb, useful in tank RB
* Has radar capability, an advantage in night battles, cloudy airspace and simulator
* Greyish camo is effective in most city, cloudy or winter maps

'''Cons:'''

* Not very manoeuvrable
* Rockets are hard to aim (they fire in an upwards arc meaning you will have to fire them at ground targets while shallow diving)
* Third crew member radar operator means slightly more weight than other Bf 110s
* Has the same DB 605 engine as its predecessor, meaning it is slower and climbs slower due to the extra drag and weight
* Low roll rate
* Defensive MG has 0 degrees depression, cannot shoot at the chaser sometimes
* Radar has a low range which makes it less effective in air RB: by the time the radar picks anything up its marker will also appear soon, giving you little advantage to sneak on the raget unsuspected
