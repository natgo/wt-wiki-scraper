== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to [[Update 1.27]]. It was available for a limited time for the 2014 anniversary of the [[wt:en/news/421--en|A-20 Havoc's first flight]], later it appeared in the [[Warbonds]] shop as part of the trophy chest in [[wt:en/news/5738-news-how-can-you-get-premium-vehicles-warbonds-en|September 2018]] and currently is only available though the [[Marketplace]].

The Boston Mk.1 is a very fast aircraft for its rank, this means that in a decent matchup it can often outrun most if not all the aircraft it faces in level flight. The Boston has got four 7.7 mm guns in the nose and two 7.7 mm in the top and bottom lower and upper of the rear fuselage.

Although the defensive armament may seem rather underwhelming, if it faces lower BR planes they can be more than adequate and can still be made to work against higher level planes. You should load a belt made up of either armour piercing or armour piercing incendiary rounds and aim for the engine of enemy plane(s) that are on your tail; this will likely do one of these things: 1) Destroy the enemy plane's engine 2) Set the enemy plane on fire 3) Knock out the plane's pilot (from shots that go astray).

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 12.7 mm steel in front of the cockpit

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Boston is an incredibly fast bomber, being able to outrun everything it will face. The bomb load lacks a bit of punch as it carries the inferior British [[G.P. Mk.IV (500 lb)|500 pound bomb]] which has much less TNT. Decent defensive firepower means it can defend itself if it has to, but the best defense for the Boston is its cruising speed of 450 km/h to outrun any pursuers.

The Boston excels as a ground strike aircraft, dropping its payload on pillboxes and armoured targets and using its quadruple forward facing 7.7 mms to destroy artillery, AA or vehicles. It can also be used as a strike aircraft very effectively, diving on enemy fighters with its high top speed and damaging them before using the energy to gain altitude again. The 7.7s are unlikely to destroy enemy aircraft outright but can damage vital components like the engine, oil or coolant - forcing the enemy to return to base.

The Boston can take a fair amount of punishment, but it won't last in an extended firefight against enemy fighters on its tail. Being fairly manoeuvrable, evasive measures should be taken as you can't rely solely on the defensive armament to keep you safe - it should be used as a deterrent while you turn. It won't outturn a 109 or similar enemy aircraft, but it will maintain more speed in them, allowing you to get more distance between their guns and your tail. It should also outperform early German fighters at high altitude (above 3.5 km), where the Boston can be used as a bomber hunter.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very fast cruising and top speed
- Decent offensive armament
- Lots of ammunition
- Fairly durable
- Can fly with one engine

'''Cons:'''

- Defensive armament isn't great
- Only one payload option
- Big engines are big targets, they will almost always get damaged in a fight

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The Douglas Boston Mk.I/Mk.II was a twin-engine light bomber/ground-attack aircraft which was initially developed for the United States Army Air Corps, but first entered service as an export model.

The first customer for the aircraft was the French government, which designated the bomber the DB-7 and ordered 100 aircraft. A contract for a second batch of 170 aircraft was finalized with the Douglas Aircraft Company; these machines differed from the first batch by being equipped with Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S3C4-G radial air-cooled engines with two-speed superchargers that delivered better performance characteristics at higher altitudes, thus increasing their maximum speed. The maximum power of the new engines was raised to 1,200 hp.

The aircraft that had not been sent from the USA before France was defeated were diverted to Britain for use by RAF Bomber Command. The RAF renamed the aircraft as the "Boston" to indicate its American origin.

The new Bostons required several modifications for British use: the instruments, which had been set to the metric system, were replaced. Throttle quadrants made according to the French standard were redone, and British radio sets and oxygen equipment were installed on the aircraft.

The defensive armament was also replaced: the forward fuselage now had four 0.303 inch Colt-Browning Mk.II machine guns with 500 rounds each, fed by disintegrating belts. The radio operator/gunner's cockpit had two 0.303 inch Vickers K machine guns with pan magazines and 470 rounds each; the first was located in the rear upper gun position, and the second in the lower hatch.

The DB-7 with Pratt & Whitney R-1830-SC3-G engines was designated the Boston Mk.I in the RAF whilst the Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S3C4-G powered variant was named the Boston Mk.II.

According to British pilots, the Boston had excellent handling characteristics and good visibility from the cockpit and the aircraft's tricycle landing gear made take off and landing significantly easier.

As the Boston's performance and manoeuvrability came at the price of a short range, the RAF did not use the Boston for its original role; instead, many were converted into heavy night fighters or used in anti-shipping or as night time intruders over occupied Europe. In addition, some aircraft were used for training and auxiliary purposes.

A total of 131 machines from the second batch of DB-7s ordered by France were transferred to the RAF. After the successes in RAF service, the Boston was adopted by the United States Army Air Corps, the service it was originally designed and intended for.
