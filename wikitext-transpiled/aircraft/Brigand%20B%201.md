== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.63 "Desert Hunters"]].

This plane is an effective bomber hunter and ground attack aircraft. If there are no bombers for you to hunt, switch to attacking fighters using the altitude advantage given by the bomber spawn. Should you survive to late match and find that the tickets will decide the match then you may load up air-to-ground weapons, but not before that.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In AB and RB, you should immediately bomber hunt, as those will be your easiest kills, combined with your bomber altitude, you should stay high until you run out of targets to engage then you should go for fighters, before ground targets when it is safe to do so. When diving, use your airbrakes to be sure not to exceed your maximum speed of 680kph in a dive. Exceeding 550kph, sustaining a flick roll and other sharp acrobatics may break your wings.

'''How to offensively engage an enemy aircraft:'''<br>
While it is tempting because of the Brigand's strong armament, avoid fully committing to head ons where possible, as the Brigand has a sluggish control response which will impede your ability to dodge and you will almost certainly receive some damage if you do not break off quickly after firing. When engaging bomber targets, avoid sitting on their tail as the Brigand is a large target for their tail gunners - make a high speed pass, disengage, and assess the enemy bomber for another attack if necessary. Be wary dogfighting fighters, as while the Brigand is quite capable at turning, its ability to retain and generate energy is below most fighters, and firing solutions can be difficult to capitalise on due to its unwieldy controls. In a long fight or at a numerical disadvantage this can easily become your downfall.

'''How to perform defensive fighting:'''<br>
Should an enemy get on your six, your best bet is to bolt towards allied fighters/airfield and give the enemy a hard time aiming at you. While moving in the same general direction, dart your nose around and play with the roll and rudder. Flick rolls are a near-necessity in the Brigand to quickly rotate the aircraft and will be a crucial asset to dodge guns. Avoid going up when defensive, as you will quickly find yourself low on energy and vulnerable. The Brigand is a large target, so you must maintain situational awareness to be able to dodge incoming shots, else you will almost certainly be hit.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great armament of four nose-mounted Hispano V cannons
* Bomber spawn (AB and RB)
* Decently manoeuvrable for an aircraft of its size, especially with combat flaps, capable of out-turning fighters like the Bf 109 and P-51 at some speeds
* Plenty of ammo
* Good attack payloads of 2,000 lbs or 16 RP-3 Rockets, even mixed
* Very good cockpit visibility
* Heavy armour on the nose of aircraft for head-ons
* Air brakes that provide lift upon usage

'''Cons:'''

* Generally slow
* Average climb rate
* Massive target
* No defensive gunners on the aircraft
* Air brakes lack performance under 600 km/h
* Early bomb modifications are mounted far on the wings, making them hard to aim
* Bad roll rate
* Poor performance at high altitude

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Designed to replace the famous Bristol Beaufighter series, the Bristol Type 164 "Brigand" was based on the already in production Bristol Buckingham, a transport/liaison aircraft intended to have been a medium bomber like the [[Wellington Mk III|Wellington]]. Because of this, the Brigand was substantially larger than its predecessor and its performance suffered in suit. Originally conceived as a fast torpedo attacker, the Brigand turned out to be a heavy strike bomber, and only the first eleven airframes were ever torpedo capable.

The Brigand B.1 as seen in-game would first see service with No. 84 and No. 8 Sqn RAF in Aden, modern-day Yemen. While not seeing action, the hot, dry climate of the Arabian peninsula was ideal for the Brigand and production continued. The Brigand would next be handed over to Beaufighter squadron No. 45 based out of Tengah, Singapore in engaging Communist guerillas in and around Malaya (Modern day Malaysia). It was here where the Brigand would receive its trial of fire, bombing and rocketing swathes of the South-East Asian jungles on the hunt for this red menace. However, the humid climate and constant stress from dive bombing would be the death sentence for this aircraft. The leather and rubber seals used on the hydraulic jacks of the landing gear and dive brakes rotted away, causing gear failures and some dive brakes failing, leading to crashes and wing tearing. This, combined with the Brigand's wings being unable to cope with the constant dive-bombing, led to it being withdrawn from service in Malaya by 1952, and from Aden by 1954.
