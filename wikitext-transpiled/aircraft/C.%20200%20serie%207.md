== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]], but a variant existed in the [[C.200 serie 7 (Germany)|German tech tree]] prior to the update.

[[File:FighterImage_MC200s7vsP36C.jpg|thumbnail|right|C. 200 vs [[P-36C|P-36C ''Hawk'']] over industrial zone in Ruhr.]]
The Macchi 200 is a standard fighter of the Italian air tree. It is moderately armed for its tier, consisting of two 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns firing through the propeller arcs. an The M.C 200 is a fairly typical pre-war Italian design, Moderate speed combined with good rates of turning, and high speed tolerance, while maintaining good controls at all speeds. Furthermore, the MC 200 is a capable climber, easily matching a lot of planes that it will regularly meet in its battle rating range. It is fairly though, capable of taking hits and return to the airfield for repairs. However it does have its issues as well, most notably the poor engine power which results in poor acceleration and, much like all Italian designs, it suffers from poor armament as well, although given the lower battle rating then the [[C.202|Folgore]], this is less of an issue. Furthermore, as of 1.55, its payload is not modeled, so it does not carry bombs, meaning it is a poor ground attacker. Being only able to harm soft Ground targets.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- No armour
- Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 underneath the machine guns, 1 underneath pilot and 1 behind pilot)

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (370 rpg = 740 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

In general it is recommended to climb as much as you can before engaging, a good 3,000-4,000 m is important, for it can be used to get some extra speed once needed. For Combat, it can engage in a wide array of moves, the decent energy retention and high speeds it can attain, about 800 km/h, before it begins to red-line, means it can be used for Boom & Zoom, or to get away. Furthermore its a good turn-fighter, it out-turns a lot of planes it faces, exception being biplanes and Japanese aircraft. However take care, the engine is not the most powerful, and accelerating is problematic. So it is important to watch the speed carefully in combat. This becomes especially important as the engine is also quite prone to [[Thermodynamics|overheat]] when WEP is engaged, though it cools fairly quickly on 100%.

For the armament, the same applies to all other Italian aircraft; generally you want to use "Omni-Purpose Belts", they have that kinetic energy that you deserve to kill enemy planes and the " I- Incendiary" shell that works better than the IAI in terms of setting enemy on fire due to the fact that IAI aren't well modelled in-game. Shell velocity is low, hence they suffer above 300 m, so only fire at or below that range for best effects. Furthermore, much like the other Italian fighters the armament is woefully inadequate to deal with bombers, hence it is best to avoid them entirely, or focus on taking out the engines. Only exception are the very early biplane bombers, such as [[Swordfish Mk I|Swordfish]], [[Po-2]] and the likes.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very nimble
- Can turn on-par/better than other monoplanes
- Great visibility from cockpit

'''Cons:'''

- Sub-par weapons
- Low top-speed

A single-engine fighter with retractable landing gear.

The M.C.200, soon nicknamed the Saetta ("Lightning"), was created in 1937 as an interceptor, designed to ""protect our national territory in case of need"". The plane was used until about 1943 as an escort plane and a ground attack fighter. It was particularly active in the North African theater, where the Saetta was highly prized in the desert conditions for its rugged construction and manoeuvrability.

In combat, the Saetta's most dangerous opponent was the Hurricane. The M.C.200 was inferior to the Hurricane in terms of maximum speed, but it had superior manoeuvrability, turning radius and rate of climb. The Saetta had a radial 14-cylinder A.74 RC38 engine (870 hp). Its armament consisted of two 12.7 mm SAFAT machine guns. Later, the fighter was fitted to carry eight 15 kg bombs.

Modifications of the M.C.200 had no major changes in equipment. The M.C.200 series 3 could carry additional fuel tanks. From start to finish of its production, the aircraft's payload capacity was increased from 429 to 522 kg."
