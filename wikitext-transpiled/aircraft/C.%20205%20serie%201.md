== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]] along with the initial Italian aviation tree.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The C.205 is an excellent climbing aircraft, with a fairly good top speed and roll rate. It does not rip easily or compress, and remains fairly responsive at all speeds.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

;Protection

- 8 mm Steel - Armoured plate behind the pilot
- 50 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen
- Self-sealing fuel tanks x 4

;Vulnerabilities

- Critical components located at the front of aircraft (pilot, engine, control systems)

{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)
- 2 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The C.205 Serie 1 is perhaps the most underrated rank III Italian fighter, most likely due to the underpowered armament which consists of 2 x 12.7 mm and 2 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns. This can be a serious problem since this fighter is Boom & Zoom fighter, meaning even a successful pass will badly cripple the target instead destroying it. Therefore, stick with teammates in order to support them. The C.205 Serie 1 works well when escorting bombers.

This fighter can climb fast for its rank and battle rating, thanks to DB 605-A which was installed in Bf 109 G-2, even in stock. The {{PAGENAME}} could climb up to 5,000 m in to seek enemy planes, but higher than 6,000-7,000 m is recommended for safest altitude. Use this advantage when retaining energy, to outrun enemies or gain altitude if the first pass failed and make up the second pass. Although the engine provides considerable manoeuvrability, one should not do excess dogfighting toward the target, as it will burn up energy faster. Never attempt to make contact with manoeuvrable fighters, like Spitfires and Yaks, especially at low altitude. Call teammates, then gain some altitude until the enemy cannot pursue. Use this chance to make a counter-attack and destroy the enemy. One thing to note, this plane's propeller pitch can be tweaked to the maximum value without blowing the engine, unlike all Bf 109s with the same engine when using manual engine control.

When in stock, the armament leaves much to be desired: low velocity and ball ammunition limit the effectiveness of the weapon. Never attempt to head-on by any means; chances are the opponent's bullets will reach the C.205 before its own. One thing should be noted: while the C.205 has a powerful engine at its battle rating, never intercept bombers without teammates, especially when down-tiered. However, these machine guns prove quite effective against dive-bombers or low-flying bombers. Try to aim for the wings or the engine(s) for a desirable hit. Adjust the machine gun convergence to 250-300 m for the most effectiveness. It is recommended to load Air Targets or Universal belts for the 12.7 mm machine guns, along with Stealth belts for the 7.7 mm machine guns.

Overall, {{PAGENAME}} is a support Boom & Zoom fighter with good climb rate, reasonably fast for its battle rating. While being overshadowed by underperformed armament among all the fighters, in the hands of a skilled player this fighter became a bane among all the enemy fighters and even to bombers.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Arguably fast and nimble against any opponents at its battle rating, thanks to the engine from Bf 109 G-2
- Tweaking the propeller pitch in MEC will not blow the engine, unlike the Bf series with the same engine
- Excellent energy retention and roll rate
- Reasonable climb rate
- Excellent high altitude performance
- Good straight-line acceleration

'''Cons:'''

- Inadequate armament at its tier, shots tend to only cripple your enemies instead destroy it
- Hard to control during low speed and altitude
- Any damage severely degrades aircraft functionality

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The last Italian fighters of the war (the Serie 5, or "third-generation") all used the new German Daimler Benz 605 engine, putting them on a par with the best mid-war aircraft. The M.C. 205 was the only one of the Serie 5's to see much service with the Italian air force. The prototype, based on the M.C. 202, first flew in April 1942. The added power allowed it to become the first Italian aircraft with cannon armament in the wings. It was considered extremely manoeuvrable at middle and low altitudes. About 200 were built and delivered starting in October 1942, seeing combat service in the Mediterranean and Sicily the next year. Another 112 were built after the armistice and delivered to Fascist Italian forces, who used the plane until summer, 1944. Others continued on in Allied use and after the war remained in service as combat fighters until 1947.
