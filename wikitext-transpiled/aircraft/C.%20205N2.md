== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]].

The C.205N, also known as the "Orione" ("Orion"), was a development of the [[C.205_serie_3|C.205V "Veltro"]] to bring more firepower and higher altitude into the aircraft's performance.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm Steel plating behind pilot
* 50 mm bullet-proof glass

== Armaments ==

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm MG 151 cannon, nose-mounted (250 rpg)
* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, wing-mounted (250 rpg = 500 total)
* 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)

The two of the cannons are each mounted in wing. A single 20 mm cannon is mounted in the nose of the aircraft, firing through the propeller hub. The two machine guns are nose mounted, positioned between the pilot and the engine of the aircraft. If fired continuously, the wing mounted cannons will run out of ammunition before the nose-mounted cannon.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The C.205N2 belongs to the select few planes who are good for [[Boom & Zoom|Boom and Zoom]] as well as turnfighting, it is an extremely balanced multi-role aircraft. It should be played neither at low altitude nor at high altitude, but in-between at medium altitude. It has no problem dealing with all other fighters at its BR, due to its ability to retain energy well. It can hold its own against [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109s]], [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190s]] and [[P-51 (Family)|P-51s]]. It can fight well against [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]] (with some skill on the pilot's part).

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High roll rate
* Good firepower
* Good acceleration, top speed and climb rate
* Short turn radius
* Good energy retention in BnZ
* High structural strength
* Lots of ammunition
* Aircraft cooling is very efficient even in hot maps

'''Cons:'''

* Roll rate deteriorates and control surfaces stiffen beyond 600 km/h (373 mph)
* Loses its manoeuvrability at low speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The C.205N2 was a further development of the [[C.205 (Family)|C.205V Veltro]], Macchi engineers tried to perfect the C.205V design and they developed the "Orione" variant with 2 different prototypes: the new variants got increased firepower and high-altitude performance. To achieve this, the engineers made the fuselage longer and increased the wingspan of the aircraft and in the second prototype they have adapted the fuselage for a 20 mm cannon within the engine shaft.
[[File:C.205N2.png|thumb|C.205N2 (MM.500) on the airfield]]
The first prototype C.205N1 (MM.499) flew on 1 November 1942 by Guido Carestiato to be later sent to Guidonia Experimental Centre for official evaluation in a fighter competition. After it, the Macchi engineers built the second variant: the [[C.205N2]] (MM.500) was flown 19 May 1943 by Lonate Pozzolo, later also flying to Guidonia for military  acceptance testing.

The first prototype C.205N1 was not accepted because the armament was not compliance with official specifications by the Tender Committee, the Macchi C.205N1 armament was armed with one 20 mm [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151/20]] cannon mounted in the fuselage and firing through the hollow hub of the propeller, and four [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT]] machine guns. Meanwhile, the [[C.205N2]] has a pair of wing-mounted 20 mm [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151/20]] cannons instead of the original  [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT]] machine guns and a 20 mm [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151/20]] cannon within the engine block.

However, as the war in the Mediterranean was drawing to a close and resources dwindling, the project failed to influence the outcome of the war as it never left prototype stage.
