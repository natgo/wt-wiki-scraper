== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.39]].

{{main|M3 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 6 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (300 rpg = 1,800 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

{{main|M117 cone 45 (750 lb)|AN-M65A1 Fin M129 (1,000 lb)|HVAR}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 16 x HVAR rockets
* 2 x 750 lb M117 cone 45 bombs (1,500 lb total)
* 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 Fin M129 bombs (2,000 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Speed is everything. Reach around 1,000 km/h and then 10 to 20 degree climb then level out before dropping below 750 km/h IAS.

Watch out for planes like F-86F-2 Sabres and Hunters. These two you'll see the most and they will see you as a big threat since you pretty much out-perform them in every aspect. Destroy them before they pose any threat to you.

The CL-13's energy fighting capabilities outperform most if not all enemies of the same BR. Engagements should always occur on your terms, if you are in a bad situation make use of the Mk. 5's acceleration and roll rate to pull away if possible, then re-engage in an advantageous position.

The Mk.5's main pitfall is its lacklustre armament of six M3 machine guns. Often, sustained fire is the only way to down an enemy short of a pilot snipe. Snapshots will often result in a few hits and an enemy still very much in the fight. However, the high velocity and large ammo count makes accuracy a secondary concern. Pilots should not hesitate to douse their enemies in a hail of machine gun fire, as even a few hits can cripple the enemy and open them up for a second, fatal pass. Engaging in head-on passes with enemies sometimes leads to success owing to the velocity of the M3s, but pilots should be careful to start firing at significant distance and peel off before the 1.0 km mark to avoid enemy fire. Whilst dogfighting, the best shot of finishing engagements lies in exploiting the CL-13's energy superiority and forcing the enemy to bleed speed to the point where they are sitting ducks for your guns. This should not come at the cost of losing one's own speed, however, as the Mk. 5's high speed manoeuvrability falls off very quickly and can leave you as the sitting duck instead.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The CL-13A Mk 5 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent roll rate at all speeds
* Flying tail elevator provides insane manoeuvrability at higher speeds
* High velocity heavy machine gun armament
* High rate of fire .50 cal M3 machine guns
* Turn rate is very good (not better than F-86A-5/F-40 Sabre)
* Very good climb rate against all jets
* Better acceleration than most jets at its BR, accelerating more than any other Sabre in game
* All round aircraft (good at AB, RB, and SB)

'''Cons:'''

* Low speed manoeuvrability worse than earlier jets
* Installed boosters breaks your wings if pulled over 12 G
* Weak landing gear
* Its excessive flight performance very often causes overconfidence, which can prove deadly

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== The CL-13 Series ===
The CL-13 series of aircraft were built by Canadair under licence from North American Aviation. These fighters would be operated by Canada until 1958, and a variety of other nations until much later, with the last variants being retired by the Pakistani Air Force in 1980. There were two major production runs of the aircraft. The first, the Mk. 2 and Mk. 4s with just under 1,000 built, were very similar to their US counterparts, with minor differences. The second run, the Mk. 5s and Mk. 6s of similar numbers, were patterned on the later versions North American Sabre, with larger wings for improved manoeuvrability. The major difference lay in the replacement of the General Electric J47 engine with the locally-designed more-powerful Avro Canada Orenda. The Mk. 6, with a more powerful two-stage version of the Orenda and improved control surfaces, is generally considered the best of all Sabre variants.

=== The CL-13 Mk. 5 ===
On 30 July 1953, the first Sabre Mk.5 flew with the Orenda 10 engine, which gave it a clear rate of climb and ceiling advantage over earlier variants. This improvement was accompanied by a new oxygen system and superior manoeuvrability and low-speed characteristics achieved by increasing the wing chord by six in. (15.2 cm) at the root and three in. (7.2 cm) at the wing tip. The aircraft also made use of a small vertical wing  fence, a modification originated by North American on the F-86F, which dramatically improved manoeuvrability. Earlier variants of the CL-13 were equipped with leading edge wing slats that were removed in the Mk.5, leading to increased landing speed and considerably degraded low speed handling. The increase in engine power also came at the cost of range, a full 20 percent less than that of the F-86F. Canadair built 370 Mk. 5s with the majority designated to replace older Sabre variants in RCAF air squadrons.

=== Service in the Luftwaffe ===
In 1956 the newly-revived West German Luftwaffe ordered 225 Canadair [[CL-13B Mk.6|CL-13 Mk. 6]]s to outfit 3 day-fighter wings. In advance of the delivery, 75 retired Royal Canadian Air Force Mk. 5s were supplied to the training unit Waffenschule 10 to facilitate the conversion of pilots to the Sabre. By April of 1960 about 25 of these aircraft remained airworthy, down from a peak of 65 in early 1959. All of the remaining Mk. 5s were scrapped or sold by March of 1962.<ref>http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p86_22.html</ref>
