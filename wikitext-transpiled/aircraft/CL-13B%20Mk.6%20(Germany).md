== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In 1949, Canada wanted a new fighter to supplement its growing air force. The F-86 Sabre was a good option, but the Canadian government didn't want to have another American aircraft in service. As a compromise, Canada received a license to build their own Sabres and thus birthed the Canadair Sabre. At first, they were essentially the same as the US [[F-86A-5|F-86A]]. As development and production continued, Canadair Sabres were growing different and even had their own engine installed, the Avro Orenda jet engine. Many variants of the Canadair Sabre were built, but the last variant was the Mk 6. It was quite similar to the Mk 5, except in engines: the Mk 6 was powered by the Orenda 14 engine. It provided a 14% increase in thrust and greatly improved the Mk 6's performance. The climb rate, top speed, and service ceiling were all improved. It would be one of the best-performing Sabres and was delivered to many countries, including Germany. The last Canadair Sabre was built for Germany and marked the end of production. Germany received over 200 Mk 6 Sabres and would later be modified to launch AIM-9B Sidewinders. 

Introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is one of the best Sabres in-game. It features some of the best manoeuvrability thanks to the addition of leading-edge slats and relatively low weight. The Grenada 14 allowed the CL-13 to climb much faster and accelerate more quickly compared to the F-86F Sabres. Although it was a massively improved Sabre, the CL-13B still retains the six M3 Browning machine guns mounted on the nose. The CL-13B can also utilize the [[AIM-9B Sidewinder]], which is helpful for forcing opponents to turn and pick off slow targets. However, it lacks flares, which becomes a major issue in uptiers against [[AIM-9L Sidewinder|AIM-9Ls]] and [[R-60M|R-60Ms]]. Players need to be extra cautious in uptiers and stay away from aircraft like the [[Su-25 (Family)|Su-25]] and [[A-10A|A-10]], which are armed with all-aspect missiles.
== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The CL-13B Mk 6 is one of the best performing jet fighters from the Sabre family, its power plant is the Avro Canada Orenda 14 engine which is a huge improvement over the previous versions. The level speed at sea level was increased to 1122 km/h which is better than in every MiG-15 or MiG-17.
Its acceleration was also increased to the level similar to these jet fighters, the power to weight ratio when the plane is fully loaded is 0.56, better than in any F-86 model, with the exception of the K version and comparable with the other jets like the British Hawker Hunter F.1.
The plane also offers phenomenal climb rate performance: 62 m/s at sea level and it takes only 3 minutes and 45 seconds to climb to 9,000 m, which it is better than MiGs, the Hunter F.1 and most jet fighters that do not have an afterburner.

The wings in this version are equipped with slats which significantly increase its turning performance and it is also the only difference compared to the early F versions and the previous CL-13. The plane also does not suffer from high speed compression. Despite a heavy weight and high wing loading, its turn rate is very similar to the MiG-17's, but thanks to its improved engine the CL-13 should be able to outperform it in vertical manoeuvres.
Its roll rate is excellent at any speed (there are only a few planes that can match it) to the point it can create a risk of breaking wings when pulling too hard and rolling at the same at very high speed, especially with full real controls which do not limit the elevator deflection angle like the instructor does.
The flaps have a quite high speed limit and can be used to improve its dogfighting capabilities even further and it is equipped with an airbrake like every other F-86, which is efficient enough to make the plane slow down in combat situations or when it is landing.

With full real controls the plane is very easy to control as well as quick to respond and does not require any elevator trimming. Stalling and spinning are very rare events: after pulling it as much as possible, the plane will not start spinning immediately: it will reach the maximum angle of attack and still keep the same direction and that can be used to pull high angle attacks. It takes up to a few seconds of pulling it to make the plane start rolling to one side and then spinning and can be easily countered by just letting the controls unsollicited for a moment.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 6.35 mm steel - in front of cockpit
* 12.7 mm steel - pilot's seat
* 20 mm steel - pilot's head rest
* 38 mm bulletproof glass - armoured windscreen

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

It is recommended that the first-researched module be the Compressor, followed by additional armament modifications (leading up to the AIM-9B missile), and then the Engine upgrade. Ammunition belt options are not a priority as all ammo belts perform similarly, and the New Boosters module is also unnecessary given that the CL-13B already has good high-speed manoeuvrability and because they make it much easier to wing-rip.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M3 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 6 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (300 rpg = 1,800 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M65A1 Fin M129 (1,000 lb)|AIM-9B|HVAR}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 16 x HVAR rockets
* 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 Fin M129 bombs (2,000 lb total)
* 2 x AIM-9B missiles

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This aircraft is similar to the [[F-86A-5]] in that it is equipped with leading-edge slats that improve turn rate and energy retention in a turn. However, the Mk.6 is equipped with a significantly more powerful engine. In fact, this improved engine means that unlike all other [[F-86 (Family)|F-86 Sabres]] in the game, the Mk.6 is able to out-perform the [[MiG-17 (Family)|MiG-17]] in a climb, and as such is able to utilise vertical manoeuvres that would be a death sentence for any other Sabre. With a powerful engine, this plane can effectively use spiral-climbing in order to energy-trap MiGs. In fact, the Mk.6 has better speed, acceleration, and turn rate than all other Sabres (except the [[F-86F-40 (Japan)|F-86F-40]], which has a better turn rate).

There is a plethora of enemies that pose a threat to the {{PAGENAME}}. One such enemy is the [[F-86K (Italy)|F-86K]] or the [[Hunter F.6]], both of which have more engine power and, for the Hunter, access to the extremely manoeuvrable SRAAM missiles. However, the presence of VTOL jets such as the [[Harrier (Family)|Harrier]] and [[Yak-38 (Family)|Yak-38]] makes the airspace more dangerous for the {{PAGENAME}} due to their better missiles and general aerial performances.

Worst case scenario is when the {{PAGENAME}} gets fully uptiered and faces against supersonics such as [[F-4 Phantom II (Family)|F-4 Phantoms]] and [[MiG-21 (Family)|MiG-21s]] and their very capable IR and radar air-to-air missiles. The latter type is especially dangerous to the {{PAGENAME}} due to the lack of any Radar Warning Receiver systems. As such, high-altitude fighting would not be encouraged, especially when supersonics outclimb the {{PAGENAME}} anyways. Still, supersonic aircraft tend to manoeuvre worse than the {{PAGENAME}}, so it is still possible to defeat them with an energy-trap or catch an unaware opponent with your missiles; but that more often than not depends on luck.

Another point to note is that the CL-13B has poor engine performance at high altitudes. Not to mention that by the time you get there, battle will be already over. So, it is advisable to engage enemies as close to sea-level as possible.

The CL-13B's greatest weakness lies in its six 12.7 mm machine-guns. At this rank, cannons are the standard, and although ammunition count is high, these lower-calibre guns don't have a great damage output. Snapshots are rarely fatal, and often sustained firing time is necessary to secure a kill. Luckily, with the amount of ammunition that this plane carries, spray and pray firing tactics are very much a possibility. As for belt selection, tracer rounds are better-suited for setting fire to enemy aircraft, while more AP-heavy belts are more likely to damage structural components and injure the pilot. Stealth belts are, as always, an option as well. No one belt is undisputedly superior to the rest, so playstyle and personal preference will determine which belt should be chosen.

Like many jets at this battle rating, the CL-13B is equipped with early air-to-air missiles. [[AIM-9B]] missiles are effective against slow-moving enemies, but are often useless at high speeds; most top-rank aircraft will usually pop flares or perform basic turn and thus evade the measly 10 Gs manoeuvring missile.

The {{PAGENAME}} deals with a wide range of top-rank enemies due to its battle rating position currently, and more often than not faces enemy that outperforms the {{PAGENAME}} in some shape or form. However, the {{PAGENAME}} can still be a capable aircraft when its strengths are played against the opponent's weaknesses.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The CL-13B Mk.6 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.
