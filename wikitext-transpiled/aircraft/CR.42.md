== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was known as the pinnacle of biplane design. Developed to replace the CR.32 with a design that shared the same spirit while being more capable and modern, the aircraft was already outdated by the start of WWII but saw great success in the Spanish Civil War, even against Soviet monoplanes like the I-16. At the start of WWII, the CR.42 was used with some success in escort missions, night raids, and interception. The aircraft fared well against early Hurricanes and Spitfires thanks to its agility, but it was soon phased out with the introduction of faster, more armoured, and overall more advanced fighters.

The CR.42 was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]] along with the initial Italian aviation tree, though an [[CR.42 (Germany)|identical version]] existed in the German aircraft tech tree prior to the update. The CR.42 possesses exceptional manoeuvrability, speed, and durability, especially for a biplane. Its armament, two Breda-SAFAT .50 cal machine guns, is also quite good. However, due to its BR, the majority of aircraft the CR.42 will engage will be faster and more heavily armed. The best bet for survival, and getting scores, is to climb to medium altitude and lure fighters into turn fighting. An overwhelming majority of pilots are unwilling to run from a lowly biplane, allowing you to score critical damage before they realise that they have expended all their energy and must extend away from you. By then, the damage is usually severe enough that they will not be able to accelerate away quickly enough to escape further damage. As a CR.42 pilot, you depend on the enemy committing to the turn fight; if they try to run away or make the fight an energy fight, there is almost nothing you can do, so use your opportunities when you have them.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
As one of the last generation of biplane fighters, the CR.42 incorporates many advantages , but also disadvantages of said built. Notably a low stall speed, predicating it for Turn Fights. Climb speed is good to great, but cannot compare to many later fighters ([[:Category:Second_rank_aircraft|Rank II]]). Another advantage gained is the relatively high break speeds of ~570 km/h IAS and the late lock up speed of 450 km/h IAS for the elevator. The top speed is good for [[:Category:First_rank_aircraft|Rank I]], but only reached after a short dive and quickly dwindles with damage received.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Biplanes by design have a lot of surface and consequently have plenty of aircraft to be shot at. This makes them feel more vulnerable than they really are, although again: They are fairly big, hard to miss targets, so the feeling is justified. Even more so as the fabric skin is easily damaged by small arms fire. The change to a aluminium monocoque fuselage design was linked with an increase in armament size for a reason. However, here lies a great advantage: Many explosive triggers and fuses have their detonation sensitivities set to metal skins, not fabric ones, so they may just whizzle through your craft, leaving only two 20 mm sized holes.

The CR.42 in itself features no armour. Only the air cooled rotary engines is rather durable due to lacking any water-cooling and by design.

{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)

The two machine guns are both mounted on the upper fuselage just in front of the pilot and fire through the propeller arc. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty.

The center lined armament is always a great advantage. However compared to other nation's fighter crafts with their fast firing 7.7 mm machine guns, the BREDA's slower rate of fire offsets the gained advantage in calibre size and explosive ammunition (IAI).

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
=== Arcade Battles ===
The CR.42 is nothing more than a point-and-shoot arcade-style plane. There is little skill involved at these early rank matches. Therefore, turning is the most appropriate tactic. However, due to the high climb rate, BnZ can be effective strategy in this gamemode. Most monoplanes cannot climb nearly as fast as the CR.42, so you will be able to hold the altitude advantage on them.

=== Realistic and Simulator Battles ===
In Realistic Battles (RB) and Simulator Battles (SB), as in real life, the Falco faces off against advanced mono-wing designs. While this may seem daunting at first, the CR.42 is the pinnacle of biplane evolution, only rivalled by the up-gunned [[I-153P|Chaika]] series. This aircraft begins to show the playstyle that Italian pilots will use for the rest of their in-game career; a situationally dependent switch between Energy-fighting (Boom & Zoom) and turn-fighting.

When flying in simulator battles, visibility is normal for a biplane. Rearward vistas are non-existent while forward vision is hampered by the second strut/wing. The open cockpit does provide decent visibility in general, though.

=== General Usage ===
Something that applies to this plane in all battle modes is its engine. Unlike most other biplanes and the CR.32 before it, this aircraft has a radial engine. This offers several advantages. First, it is able to offer moderate performance at all altitudes. Second, hits to the cooling system are not as damaging as they are to aircraft that have in-line engines. In-line engines will suffer from hits to their water (fluid) cooling systems - even the slightest of hits at all tiers and BRs will either outright disable the engine or make it overheat very fast, and leading to the engine's death. The engine is well-cooled and has no WEP limit, so beginner pilots will not have to worry about cooling issues or rationing Manual Engine Control.

Monoplane opponents are faster and have a superior armament. You will not be able to face these planes in head-ons, nor will you be able to disengage using a high-speed dash. Once you have engaged or been engaged by a monoplane, you must bring the engagement to an end yourself. The aircraft you have is highly agile, and can easily out-manoeuvre any monoplane it will meet- these primarily being the [[Hurricane (Family)|Hurricane family]], [[LaGG-3-11]]s, the [[P-36 (Family)|P-36 family]], and the [[M.S.405C1]]. This plane can effectively rope-a-dope these aircraft by remaining outside their reach, while continually staying in a sustained, slow, spiral climb that allows it to preserve its speed while forcing the enemy to constantly lose it. Eventually, the enemy will stall, and you will be able to easily pick it off. Stall-fighting is one of this plane's best tactics.

Even Boom & Zoom is feasible, as altitude can be gained quickly; however, the lack of cannon armament forces the pilot to use significant trigger control as well as aiming when diving and attacking opponents at a lower level.
If booming and zooming, watch your speed in a dive. The CR.42 has a speed limit of around 440-480 km/h (274-300 mph) before the wings begin shaking (i.e. you begin to hear rattling noises, and flashing red text appears on your screen) and eventually completely rip off.

The [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)]] is actually very effective for their battle rating. Tracers are by far the best belt at this BR for fighter-on-fighter combat, due to the presence of only API-T rounds, which easily set fire to enemy biplanes and provide good penetration + damage capability. Due to the machine guns being placed in the centre cowl, they provide heavy damage when the fire is focused on your opponent's wings or engine. However, when taking on bigger game such as monoplanes or bombers, it is better to take the Air Targets belt, since it has a belt composition of API-T-API-IAI that allows it to do large amounts of damage when, again, focused on critical modules such as the engines or wings. Thanks to the relatively high rate of climb and ammo pool, this aircraft is good at intercepting twin-engine bombers that begin appearing. However, it is not recommended to attempt this as a beginner pilot. The 12.7 mm MGs will require some experience to aim at the engines of enemy bombers, and in addition, the lack of armour leaves a good possibility for pilot-snipes and critical hits by enemy bombers.

In summary, the CR.42 Falco is a good introduction to the situational hybrid fighting style of later aircraft. It is a severely underappreciated aircraft that deserves more love and usage by pilots and is a forgiving aircraft for beginners to fly.

The CR.42 was Fiat's attempt at modernising their CR.32 design, which was deployed during the Spanish Civil War with great success. The new fighter would be of all-metal construction, with Fiat's new, homegrown A.74 supercharged radial engine. The result was a fast, accurate, and manoeuvrable platform, that, while outdated at the onset of World War II, would be almost the pinnacle of biplane design.

Early in the war, CR.42's were used with some success as escorts, night fighters, and even interceptors. Against the early Hurricanes and Spitfires, Italian and German pilots both were delighted to find that the manoeuvrability of the Falco put it, at the least, on par in a dogfight. However as the war dragged on, and enemy aircraft became faster, the CR.42 was relegated to night harassment, light ground attack, and sparingly used as night fighters.

The CR.42 is also credited with the world's last aerial combat biplane kill. A group of CR.42's based in Croatia under the command of ''Nachtschlachtgruppe 7'' were directed to Grabovica Airfield for a strafing mission. However, the flight was redirected at the last moment to a harassment mission northwest of Sisak, where they were intercepted by P-38's of the 14th Fighter Group. Three Fiats were lost for two P-38's, one of which was claimed by an unknown German pilot.

Over 1,780 were built. The plane was designed by Fiat's Celestino Rosatelli, who was also behind the CR.32 and the B.R. 20. He replaced the 32's inline engine with a less vulnerable air-cooled radial engine. Foreign orders came from Hungary (50), Belgium (34), and Sweden (72). It entered combat service with the Italian 53rd Gruppe in May 1939. At the start of the war, it was the backbone of Italy's fighter force.

Belgium's CR. 42s were the first to see action in May 1940, claiming 3 aerial victories, but losing most of their fighters on the ground. Italy used them in the 1940 French campaign, the Battle of Britain, and over Greece, the Mediterranean, and Africa, where they sparred with another biplane, the Gloster Gladiator, until the arrival of British Hurricanes and Spitfires. 113 were still in service when Italy surrendered in September 1943.
