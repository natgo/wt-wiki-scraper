== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Canberra B Mk 6 was the second production run of the English Electric Canberra, improving over the original [[Canberra B Mk 2|Mk 2]] with more powerful engines, fuel tanks in the wings, and a slightly lengthened fuselage. An interdictor variant known as the '''Canberra B (I) Mk 6''' was also created as an interim prior to introduction of the more dedicated Mk 8, featuring a detachable ventrally mounted gun pod enclosing four 20 mm Hispano cannons, two wing hardpoints to make up for the partially occupied bomb bay, and provision for a toss bombing system allowing the use of nuclear weapons. Entering service in 1955, the Canberra B (I) Mk 6 was soon withdrawn from Bomber Command operations in 1961, but maintained operational readiness in the nuclear delivery role until 1972.

Introduced in [[Update 1.45 "Steel Generals"]], the Canberra B (I) Mk 6 is an interdiction model of the famous Canberra bomber, thus it is more suited for aggressive ground attack/interdiction roles by comparison to the B Mk.2 or B-57A models. Much like the B-57B, it retains its bomb carrying capabilities, but also features an impressive battery of armament consisting of four 20 mm Hispano Mk V cannons, each with a 500-round capacity, making it a truly formidable attack aircraft and also allowing for air-to-air combat with other aircraft. The Canberra is surprisingly agile for its size, allowing it to catch opposing aircraft off-guard; coupled with its bomber spawn, it can be highly effective in intercepting other jet bombers or dropping in on unsuspecting fighters from behind enemy lines.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* No armour plating
* No armour glazing
* Critical components located in the fuselage of the aircraft (fuel, pilot, controls)
* Engines in wings

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Canberra B (I) Mk 6 can be played a few different ways. You can bomb the bombing targets as a bomber, but then you can use the plane to its full potential as a heavy fighter. The Canberra rolls decently when slow, but when you start to turn, the elevator will pull and the plane has a decent turning circle for its size. The 4 x Hispano Mk.V cannons are decently easy to aim as they are mounted on the underbelly of the aircraft. You have 2,000 rounds of ammunition which can easily deal with multiple targets with plenty of ammo to spare. The best way to play this aircraft is Boom and Zooming, where you dive on a target and have a gun run on them and after the run is over pulling off and going back up using your speed for altitude. The aircraft gets a bomber spawn which will spawn you at a high altitude and decent speed at the start of the match.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High-speed attack aircraft
* High cannon ammo capacity
* Large bomb-carrying capabilities
* Good agility

'''Cons:'''

* No defensive armament
* Large surface area
* High speed makes it hard to bomb smaller targets such as tanks
* Loss of one 1,000 lb bomb compared to previous model [[Canberra B Mk 2]]

After the runaway success of the first English Electric Canberra variants, further development was an inevitability. A single Canberra B Mk.5 was constructed as a test bed of marrying the airframe with the new, more powerful Rolls-Royce Avon RA7 jet engines with a lengthened fuselage leading to a greater fuel capacity. Trials proved to be successful and the resulting Canberra B Mk.6 entered service with the RAF in 1954.

The B Mk.6 was some 10 mph faster and also saw a range increase from approximately 2,600 miles to just under 3,400 miles, significantly improving flexibility of operations for RAF Bomber Command.

The B Mk.6 also spawned the development of the interim B(I) Mk.6, which added a ventral pack containing four 20 mm Hispano cannon and an additional two hard points on the wings for external stores. It also included the Low Altitude Bombing System for the release of nuclear weapons in a climb from low altitude.

The Canberra saw service with both the RAF, RNZAF and RAAF during the Malayan Emergency. RAF Canberra B Mk.6's also served alongside the earlier B Mk.2 and Photographic Reconnaissance variants during the Suez Crisis in 1956.

Whilst the Canberra was phased out of service as an RAF front line bomber in the early 1960s it continued to be used for a staggering 50 years in other roles, particularly photographic reconnaissance, and even flew operationally in the 1991 Gulf War. It finally retired from service with the RAF in June 2006. The Canberra saw great success across a number of variants and was exporting to many countries such as Australia, the United States, France, India, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, West Germany, Venezuela, Sweden, South Africa, Rhodesia, Zimbabwe, Peru, Ecuador and Ethiopia.
