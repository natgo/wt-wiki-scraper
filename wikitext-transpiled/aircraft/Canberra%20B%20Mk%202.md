== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In 1944, the Air Ministry issued a specification for a new high-speed, high-altitude bomber to replace the illustrious [[Mosquito (Family)|de Havilland Mosquito]]. While English Electric had been involved in aircraft construction since the interwar period, including producing airframes for the Handley Page [[Hampden (Family)|Hampden]] and [[Halifax B Mk IIIa|Halifax]], they had little design experience of their own. However, this was solved by the joining of W.E.W. Petter, Westland's chief designer, who had left Westland to pursue his own twin-engine fighter-bomber design after being rejected. By 1949, the first prototypes had taken flight, and in 1950, following the outbreak of the Korean War, 410 aircraft were ordered for the RAF, as well as a number for export, notably the US (license-produced as the [[B-57A]]) and Australia. The first production run, designated '''Canberra B Mk 2''', entered RAF service in 1951, replacing the Mosquito and [[Lincoln B Mk II|Lincoln]] in frontline bombing and photoreconnaissance roles.

Introduced in [[Update 1.43]], the Canberra B Mk 2 can be a very effective early jet bomber. It has a great climb rate and decent top speed which, coupled with its bomber spawn, allow it to either climb up away from the threat of interceptors or dive towards enemy bases. The Canberra is not equipped with any offensive or defensive armaments, so in both cases, survivability will rely on maintaining the speed to outrun any interceptors and using its surprising agility to avoid pot-shots. The payload is adequate, with six 1,000 lb bombs being enough to destroy a base.

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* No armour plating
* No armour glazing
* Critical components located at the fuselage of the aircraft (fuel, pilot, controls)
* Engines in wings

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 9 x 500 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.II bombs (4,500 lb total)
* 6 x 1,000 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.13 bombs (6,000 lb total)
* 1 x 4,000 lb H.C. Mk.IV bomb + 2 x 1,000 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.13 bombs (6,000 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Climbing high to around 10 kilometres will save you from most predators and AA fire in both AB and RB as the Canberra has one of the best climb rates and high-alt performances in the game. Watch out for the [[Me 163 B|Me 163]] and [[Ki-200]], who can climb to you easily thanks to their Rocket Engines. A common strategy by Canberras (and B-57s, as they are the same airframe) is to head to one base, drop all payload on such base and then running for their lives. Using the 6 x 1,000 lb payload is recommended for usage on bases while 1 x 4,000 lb + 2 x 1,000 lb payload works best when used on airfields.

Alternatively, flying a 10-20 degree descent straight towards a bombing target can allow you to gain enough speed to reach the bases and bomb them before most aircraft have a chance to notice you and fire at you. Often this tactic will forfeit any chance of returning to base, as the Canberra is a large target and often the bulk of the enemy team will be a matter of kilometres away by the time you reach the base. However, it is a quick and easy way to ensure that you can destroy a base. 9x 500lb bombs is usually enough for a base, however the 6x 1,000lb payload or 1x 4,000lb + 2x 1,000lb payload will ensure that the base is destroyed, as base HP can vary depending on the BR.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good stock engine power
* Good stock acceleration speed
* Powerful airbrakes
* Good top speed for such a large aircraft
* Decent payload
* High service ceiling(max. altitude)
* Great climb rate
* Almost untouchable in Air SB (7.0 to 8.0), almost no plane can catch up with you

'''Cons:'''

* May rip wings by going straight for a while without intelligent use of air-brakes
* Likely to be a big target for fighter aircraft with an air-spawn and be engaged first.
* Slower than most fighters, which means you will be caught up by all jets that chase you
* No defensive armaments.

The Canberra B Mk.2 was created in 1949 to replace the Mosquito fast bomber. It was designed to have outstanding high altitude performance and speed, being unparalleled for 10 years. Despite the RAF originally  expecting the Canberra to be obsolete within a few years of entering service, so much so that work to develop a replacement (eventually leading to the TSR-2) was started before it had even entered service, it would go on to be one of the RAF's longest serving aircraft. The Canberra remained in front line service with the RAF until its retirement in 2006, some 55 years after it first entered service (although it spent a lot of that time in the photo-reconnaissance role, as opposed to its original purpose as a bomber). The Canberra was replaced in the strategic bomber role by the Valiant (and other V-bombers), and in the strike role by the Buccaneer (following the cancellation of the TSR-2 programme). It established a world's highest altitude record of 21,430 m in 1957 and was the first jet-powered aircraft to make a non-stop transatlantic flight.

Whilst the United States and the Soviet Union were, in many ways, running ahead of Britain during the early development of jet fighters, Britain would at least keep up if not forge ahead with its very first jet bomber – the legendary English Electric Canberra.

The origins of the Canberra lay in 1944 when the Air Ministry called for a replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito in the light bomber role – a fast, agile tactical bomber was required by RAF Bomber Command to move into the jet age. English Electric set to work under Chief Engineer WEW Petter, who envisaged a bomber built around straight wings of a large area, and two of the new Rolls-Royce Avon jet engines. The prototype first flew in May 1949, with Typhoon-ace Roland Beamont at the controls. The Chief Test Pilot remarked that the aircraft was practically free of vices and possessed an agility that was reminiscent of a fighter rather than a bomber.

After various modifications were made, including the addition of a glass nose for a bomb aimer, the first production variant – the B Mk.2 - entered service in 1951 with No.101 Squadron. The Canberra was able to reach speeds of some 560 mph and reach heights of 48,000 feet whilst maintaining the capacity to carry 6000 lbs of ordnance. A series of modified Canberra B Mk.2s set a succession of world altitude records, culminating in August 1957 with a staggering 70,310 feet. It was a Canberra that saw victory at the Last Great Air Race from London to Christchurch in 1953. With a range of approximately 2600 miles, the Canberra was considered a tactical rather than a strategic bomber.

The Canberra was popular with its aircrew due to its performance, popular with ground crews due to its relatively simple maintenance schedule and also popular with Command due to its relatively low cost. Over 400 Canberra B Mk.2's were built until uprated engines led to the development of its successor, the B Mk.6, which entered service in the summer of 1954. As squadrons received the newer model, the now older B Mk.2 saw service with the RAF in Germany, Cyprus and the Far East, although the variant did serve successfully in the Suez Crisis of 1956. A small number of export variants of the B Mk.2 also saw service with the United States as a template for building under license as the Martin B-57, Australia and Venezuela.
