== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]].

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 38 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit front.
- 3 mm Steel plates in front of cockpit, top of fuselage.
- 8 mm Steel plate behind the pilot, with 12.7 mm Steel plate on headrest.
- Critical components located at the front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 6 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (400 + 400 + 375 rpg each wing = 2,350 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 1 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bomb (500 lb total)
- 1 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bomb (1,000 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Due to its great energy retention and high dive speed, the Corsair F Mk II is very good at Boom & Zoom manoeuvres. It is recommended to be used this way especially against any Japanese planes. Against any German aircraft, Boom & Zoom operations are still recommended, however, some planes you can out turn (FW-190 A-4) and may pose a threat by using this advantage and reversing the attacker/defender roles. As with every American fighter, always climb at the start of a match. Typically, to be successful with this plane it is best to climb higher than the enemy fighters and attack them with an energy advantage. Using this tactic will greatly increase your chances of picking your battles and forcing the enemy down to lower altitudes low where either you or your teammates you can finish them off.

This unique Corsair variant rolls slightly faster than the original F4U due to having clipped wings. However, increased manoeuvrability sometimes comes at a price resulting in performance sufferage as is found with this fighter. While this fighter does well in the mid to lower altitudes, performance and manoeuvrability in the higher altitudes where the air is thinner starts to wane quickly and any advantages the clipped wings provided at lower altitudes are quickly lost and start to hinder the aircraft's performance. In comparison, these differences are slight but sometimes in the middle of the battle, the slight differences quickly determine the victor and a pilot bailing out of their crippled aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

{{main|F4U (Family)|l1=History of the F4U Corsair}}

The F4U-1A Corsair was based on the F4U-1. In fact, F4U-1A was not an official designation, but was assigned to mid-to-late production F4U-1s in order to distinguish them from early production F4U-1s postwar. The F4U-1A incorporated a simplified windscreen, and a taller, wider, two frame canopy. The pilots seat was also raised 7 in. All of these modifications increased visibility, especially over the long nose of the plane. A 6 in stall strip was also added to the right wing, outboard of the guns, allowing the wings to stall at the same speed. And, the landing gear oleo struts were improved. These changes combined lead to the clearing of the Corsair for carrier-based operations. In British service, the F4U-1A was known as the Corsair Mk II. They were modified slightly from the American design, and had their wings "clipped", meaning they had 8 in cut off of the wing tips, in order to allow them to fit on British aircraft carriers.
