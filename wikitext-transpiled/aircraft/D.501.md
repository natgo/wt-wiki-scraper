== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a subvariant of the D.500 series of aircraft developed by the French Air Ministry in the early 1930s. The D.501 used a different powerplant and armament compared to the D.500, instead of the regular Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs engine, it used the 12Xcrs, that allowed mounting a more powerful armament, in the form of a 20 mm cannon as well as a couple of machine guns. For the time of its introduction, autocannons were very rare in regular fighters, since most used a pair of light machine guns, as such the armament could be considered one of the best for its time. A total of 160 D.501s were produced by the time of WWII, with a very limited service in the front line.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]]. The D.501 is an all-metal mono-wing aircraft with an open cockpit and fixed landing gear. Built in the mid 1930s, it was one of the main French fighter aircraft until it was replaced by Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 aircraft in 1939. When playing SB (or AB and RB in cockpit view) this aircraft offers excellent visibility, only limited by the position of the wings. This aircraft has 600 rounds of ammunition between two machine guns and 60 rounds of 20 mm ammunition. This aircraft can really do some damage when gun convergence is set between 250 and 350 m.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, nose-mounted (60 rpg)
* 2 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, wing-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

The single Hispano 404 cannon is mounted centrally in the fuselage while each of the MAC 1934 machine guns are mounted on the underside of the wing. Each of the machine guns are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that they will fire with each other until empty. On the other hand, the cannon only has 60 rounds of ammunition and if fired at the same time and at the same rate as the machine guns, it will run out of ammo first.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The D.501 is a French fighter which can be utilized for air-to-air combat or ground attack on light ground units (armoured vehicles and mobile AAA units). Good speed and manoeuvrability allows this aircraft to use its rudder and ailerons to roll, turn and manoeuvre out of tight spots. When going after ground units, this aircraft can make an attack and then loop up and back over down onto remaining targets with ease. The 20 mm cannon adds an extra punch which many early aircraft do not have and can be used to great effect on other aircraft, including larger bombers. However, thanks to its bad survivability, take care when engaging bombers, and remember: don't get shot at.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Strong firepower of the 20 mm cannon is quite devastating for fragile airframes at low BR
* Nose-centered guns are easy to aim in simulator
* Agile and effective when turning and looping especially when utilizing the rudder
* Great over-the-nose visibility allowing easy aiming in a simulator dogfight
* Easy to control at low speeds meaning forgiving landing characteristics for realistic / simulator
* Open cockpit allows player to hear outside sounds easily, which is beneficial in noticing nearby enemies
* Extremely simple to land (fixed landing gear, and no flaps)
* The 20 mm cannons pierce the roof of low-tier tanks

'''Cons:'''

* Open cockpit (vulnerable to pilot sniping); no rear protection at all for the pilot
* Low ammo count of only 60 rounds is very unfriendly to beginners / bad aimers
* Critical components clustered towards front of aircraft (pilot, controls, and fuel)
* Fixed landing gear creates more drag
* No flaps, limiting its turning potential

The D.500 series of aircraft were developed in response to the C1 specification issued by the French Air Ministry in 1930. The specification mostly intended to replace France's inventory of old WW1 and 1920 era aircraft with more modern designs. Famous aircraft designer Émile Dewoitine, submitted his D.500 design and almost immediately caught the attention of the Air Ministry's officials. Shortly after the D.500 had its maiden flight in 1932, an order for 60 aircraft was placed in 1933, 10 of which were for the D.501. In essence, the D.501 was just a subvariant of the D.500. The two major differences lie in the powerplant and armament. Namely, the D.500 used a Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs engine, whilst the D.501 was equipped with a 12Xcrs engine, that allowed for the installation of a 20mm cannon through the propellor hub. This change also caused the removal of the two nose-mounted machine guns from the original layout, found on the D.500. Whilst a single 20mm cannon, paired with a couple machine guns may seem like a laughable setup today, the sheer presence of an autocannon on an aircraft back then was deemed almost as a luxury.

By the outbreak of WW2, aircraft of the D.500 series were more than outdated by machines of other nations, including some of the late 1930s French aircraft, such as the MS.406. The machines rarely saw front line use, instead being relegated to reserve units of the French Air Force and to trainer roles. However, a small number of aircraft did see limited action during the Spanish Civil War, likely being the only recorded combat use of the aircraft. Just under 400 aircraft of the D.500 series were manufactured, around 160 of which were D.501s.
