== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in the game during the Open Beta session as a reward vehicle for the [[wt:en/news/172--en|June 2013 "Vive la Liberté!"]] video contest and again for the [[wt:en/news/876/current|2014 "First Flight of Dewoitine D.520"]] event. The D.521 was a modified variant of the French Dewoitine D.520 which featured a Rolls Royce Merlin III engine and slight armament changes. Only one model was ever produced.

The D.521 is essentially a slightly improved version of the D.520. It has a somewhat improved engine (Rolls-Royce Merlin III) which constitutes the one major change. It does however have a slightly worse turn and climb rate which may be due to the added weight of said engine. At either rate, tactically, it is advised that you have good knowledge of the various aircraft's you will face as it does not excel at any one thing. By applying situational awareness and a degree of caution to your approach, you may find yourself to be quite successful with this machine, but regardless of if you approach this in Arcade or Realistic battles, you need to have a good idea about the aircraft you are likely to face in the battle rating of this aircraft.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- No armour plating
- No armour glazing
- Critical components located at the front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)
- More fuel tanks located in wings near the fuselage

{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, nose-mounted (60 rpg)
- 4 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, wing-mounted (675 rpg = 2,700 total)

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- 5 guns: one 20 mm 404 Hispano cannon near the nose of the aircraft and four 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns in the wings
- Plenty of ammo for the machine guns
- Powerful nose-mounted 20 mm cannon
- Good all round low tier fighter aircraft

'''Cons:'''

- Neither very manoeuvrable or very fast
- Very little ammo for the 20 mm cannon, limited to 60 shells
- Relatively poor rate of climb

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
A single-seat monoplane fighter with an all-metal construction, closed cockpit and retractable landing gear with a tail wheel. Designed by the SNCAM (Société Nationale des constructions aéronautiques du Midi) company. The developmental prototype of the Dewoitine D.520-01 fighter took its maiden flight on 2 October 1938. Series production began at the SNCAM (later SNCASE) plant in Toulouse.

While perfecting the series-produced Dewoitine D.520 fighters, designers also worked to create new models of the same plane. In November 1939, work began on creating the Dewoitine D.521 model, equipped with the British liquid-cooled V12 Rolls-Royce Merlin Mk.III engine with a rated output of 1,030 hp. It was suggested that a fighter fitted with this engine could reach a maximum horizontal speed of 570 km/h.

Since an engine-mounted cannon could not be installed on the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, two Hispano-Suiza H.S.404 cannons were mounted on the wings instead. This meant that all the Dewoitine D.521's weaponry was mounted on the wings, and consisted of two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 drum magazine cannons with 60 shells each and four 7.5 mm Chatellerault MAC 1934 machine guns with 675 rounds each.

Note that precise information (primarily photographs) on the practical configuration of the Dewoitine D.521's Hispano-Suiza wing-mounted cannons is not available. For this reason, we can only make educated guesses about the fighter's armament structure.

One of the early series-produced Dewoitine D.520 fighters was selected to be adapted as the Dewoitine D.521-01 prototype. Its maiden flight took place on 9 February 1940. It had an improved climbing rate, but the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was significantly heavier than the Hispano-Suiza 12Y installed on the series-produced planes, and this caused problems with the plane's center of gravity. Testing continued until March 1940. On the whole, the new plane failed to exceed the performance of the series-produced Dewoitine D.520s, and the Dewoitine D.521 project was closed.
