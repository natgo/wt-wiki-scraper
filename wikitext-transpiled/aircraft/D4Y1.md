== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28IJN.29_Official_name_designation|officially designated]] the "Suisei" (Comet)), is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]].

The Suisei was developed to replace the [[D3A1]], it was powered by the Aichi Atsuta 21 engine, a license-produced DB 601 found on the [[Bf 109 (Family)]] and many other German planes.

=== Flight performance ===

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

[[File:D4Y1wikihard1.png|thumb|The D4Y1 going into a dive to destroy a small boat]]
The D4Y1 is a highly agile and speedy aircraft, it can turn fight anything it wishes, even [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]]. It gets a bomber airspawn, which allows the D4Y1 to outclimb all the fighters, but '''be sure to select the right airspawn''', because it gets a carrier spawn by default on pacific maps. The only issue with the performance of this aircraft arises at high altitudes, where it is left without a supercharger.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The D4Y1 has no armour. Additionally, the fuel tanks are not self-sealing. There are 2 in each wing. The gunner is not covered, making him vulnerable to attacks from the rear.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The payload option should be a top priority, so getting to tier three modifications is of utmost importance. Rush the new belts and MGs, or the radiator or compressor if you choose to have better performance. Then get the bomb modification. After that, research all engine modifications and then the survivability modifications. Save the turret upgrades for last.

== Armaments ==

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

=== Suspended armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 (250 kg)|Number Type 2 50 Model 1 GP(SAP) (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:D4Y1wikihard6.png|thumb|The D4Y1 in Fiji]]
The D4Y1 is an excellent example of a multirole aircraft, as it is an excellent ground attack aircraft, fighter, and bomber. Since you get a bomber airspawn, you can drop your bomb on a base and then start to engage the many fighters below you. You should have no problems engaging them, as long is you keep your speed up and your energy high. One key thing to note is that you don't need to use your defensive turret to shoo away enemy interceptors. You can easily out turn any interceptor at that BR. Besides the fighter role, ground attack is the D4Y1's natural method of play. The 500 kg bomb will be excellent for destroying Pillboxes, and you can use your rifle-calibre machine guns to destroy any soft target you please.Spec

=== Specific enemies worth noting ===

- [[CW-21]] - The CW-21 poses a significant threat to the D4Y1, as it can out-turn, out-climb, and outclass the D4Y1 in every conceivable way. Its armament will shred through the D4Y1, and your plane would be a sitting duck. Now, your gunner can be of some use. Since the CW-21 is a very fragile aircraft, your gunner can set it afire, thus giving you the upper hand. But never under any circumstance attempt to go near this plane, as your gunner is only a last resort.
- [[He 100 D-1]] - Much like the CW-21, this aircraft will outclass you in every way. Your turret will once again come in handy, as it will surely damage its cooling system.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- '''D'''4Y for Carrier-based dive bomber:
  ** Choice between a 250 kg and a 500 kg bomb
  ** Bomber airspawn, outclimbs anything and can intercept
  \*\* Airbrakes
- Common Navy plane construction:
  ** Nose-mounted armament
  ** Small radiator drag
  \*\* Excellent manoeuvrability, can outrun early Corsairs, Wildcats, and Spitfires
- '''D4Y''' Specific:
  ** Fast, can outrun almost anything, save the [[CW-21]] and [[He 100 D-1|He 100]] \*** Its speed forces the enemy to tail behind your gunner, giving you a chance to shoot at the approaching fighter with your turret
- '''{{PAGENAME}}''' Specific:
  \*\* Has 400 more rounds in the offensive machine guns than the [[D4Y2]] and [[D4Y3 Ko]], making ammo count less of an issue

[[File:D4Y1wikihard10.png|thumb|The D4Y1 has great turret coverage, it covers a high angle of attack from boom and zoomers.]]
'''Cons:'''

- '''D'''4Y for Carrier-based dive bomber:
  ** Has bomb cradle, significant delay in fuselage bomb drop
  ** Bomb load is not good enough for bombing bases
- Common Navy plane construction:
  ** Poor offensive armament: [[Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm Type 97 MG]]
  ** Poor defensive armament: [[Type 92 (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm Type 92 MG]]
  ** Fragile, little armour, and no self-sealing fuel tanks
  ** Exposed tail gunner
- '''D4Y (early)''' Specific:
  \*\* Engine overheats easily, it isn't a traditional Japanese radial engine

[[File:D4Y1wikihard9.png|thumb|D4Y1 in flight]]
Nicknamed the "Judy" by allied pilots, the D4Y1 at the beginning of the war was one the fastest planes in all of the Pacific.

The D4Y1 was a carrier based dive bomber, powered by a 1,200 hp "Aichi AE1A Atsuta V12" engine. The D4Y1 was modeled after the German He 118 with the engine being modeled after the DB 601 which was used in the Bf 110. Due to the Japanese Navy requiring an extreme range for the aircraft, it was designed without any armour or self-sealing fuel tanks to lighten the plane so it would use less fuel. The lack of armour and protection decreased the weight, making them extremely quick and nimble but fragile if taking enemy fire. Combined with the unreliable engine, the D4Y1 would see many upgrades in the following models adjusting many of the flaws.

In 1943 with the introduction of the F6F Hellcat, the D4Y's became a sitting duck. Whereas with the F4F Wildcat, the D4Y's could just outrun them, the F6F would catch them with ease. During the "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot" a single F6F pilot Alexander Vraciu would shoot down 6 D4Y's within minutes. 400 Japanese planes would be shot down that day, but a D4Y did land a direct hit on the battleship USS South Dakota.

The D4Y's would become one of the most iconic planes the Japanese Military would use during World War 2.

Only a single complete D4Y1 survives today, located at the "Yasukuni Jinja Yūshūkan shrine" in Tokyo it can be seen completely restored.
