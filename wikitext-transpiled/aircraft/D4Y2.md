== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}} mod. 12''', designated as the '''Suisei 12 ({{Annotation|彗星一二型|Comet, Model 12}})''', upgrades the engine from the Aichi Atsuta 21 to an improved Atsuta 31 which was easier to maintain and offered an additional 200 hp, but the other issues with the engine which strained production weren't solved, leaving many Suisei 12s "noseless" right outside the production line, waiting for available engines.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]]. The D4Y2 offers an even higher speed than the previous [[D4Y1]] and with its increased output also increases loading capacity, offering mounts on the wings for either two 60 kg bombs or four (fused) rockets, which can be used on both ground or air units, especially against slower, larger bombers which can be targeted with a distance fuse, allowing for narrow misses if correctly ranged and targeted.

;Nicknames:
* [[Abbreviations#.28IJN.29_Official_name_designation|Official Designation]]: ''彗星 (Suisei, "Comet")''
* Allied reporting name: Judy

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The D4Y2 behaves much like the D4Y1: fast, agile, and powerful. However, since you don't get a radial engine, your Atsuta engine will overheat very easily on WEP, even with both radiators fully open. WEP should be used when on the deck when ground pounding, or in dogfights. Using WEP while climbing should only be done on cooler maps. It gets a bomber airspawn, which allows the D4Y2 to outclimb all the fighters, but '''be sure to select the right airspawn''', because it gets a carrier spawn by default on pacific maps. The only issue with the performance of this aircraft arises at high altitudes, where it is left without a supercharger.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The D4Y2, like its predecessor the [[D4Y1]], lacks any armour and self-sealing fuel tanks. The fuel tanks are located in the same location (2 in each wing). The gunner is still unprotected.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The payload option should be a top priority, so getting to tier three modifications is of utmost importance. Rush the new belts and MGs, or the radiator or compressor if you choose to have better performance. Then get the bomb modification. After that, research all engine modifications and then the survivability modifications. Save the turret upgrades for last.

== Armaments ==
[[File:D4Y2rockets.png|thumb|The D4Y2's fused rocket payload]]
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}

The D4Y2 is a very strong ground attack aircraft, and thanks to its high speed and agility, it can make a great fighter. This is your typical Japanese dive bomber, which has excellent ground-pounding capabilities, as well as fighter-hunting abilities. Since the D4Y2 gets a bomber airspawn, it can outclimb any fighter you want. You can also outspeed and outmanoeuvre pretty much anything, even [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]]. However, the D4Y2 carries something special, something that the [[D4Y1]] and [[D4Y3 Ko]] cannot carry, fused rockets. What some might realize about Japanese planes is their inability to bomber hunt. Fused rockets fix this issue, by being a great pick to tackle slow, sturdy, and sluggish bombers. Even if you don't get the rockets exactly on point, the explosion near the bomber could be enough to rip a wing off or damage their controls.

=== Offensive armament ===

{{main|Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.7 mm Type 97 navy machine guns, nose-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 1 x 250 kg Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 bomb (250 kg total)
* 4 x Type 3 No.1 Mod.28 Mk.1 rockets

[[File:D4Y2inflight.png|thumb|The D4Y2 in flight]]
The D4Y2 is a pilot's play, meaning that you can choose whatever role you wish in a D4Y2, since it has bombs, rockets, and a bomber airspawn.

'''Interceptor''' - The D4Y2 can carry fused rockets, meaning they'll explode after a certain distance. Usually Japanese planes are horrible interceptors, they are slow, easily set on fire by turrets, and have poor armament. However, the D4Y2 can carry rockets, turning the tables in the D4Y2's favour. Set a fuse on your rockets to whatever you please, as long as it is between 400 and 800 m. Use impact fuse however, when ground pounding. To intercept a bomber, don't rely on your machine guns. Don't tail the bomber either. Instead, dive on it, or engage in a head-on if they don't have forward guns. Fire your rockets when you are exactly the distance away from the bomber as your fuse distance is. Remember to lead, as the rockets tend to curve and don't travel as fast as the MGs.

'''Fighter''' - The D4Y2 is a great fighter, but has two flaws, armament and energy retention. Speed is your armour, as well as altitude, because you cannot retain any energy in a boom and zoom attack. It isn't a good idea to boom and zoom either, unless the enemy aircraft is a bomber, or a damaged fighter, or any other slow target. Your fights will mostly occur near the ground, where the D4Y2 has good acceleration. You can turn with anything you wish. However, there is one danger with fighting near the ground. If you lose all of your energy when turnfighting (it will happen sometimes), you become the perfect target for a boom and zoom attack. Since you can't dive away from boom and zoomers on the ground, the D4Y2 is a sitting duck. The turret won't do anything either, but trying to dodge the incoming threat is still a good option, as long as you keep your speed up.

'''Attacker''' - Since the D4Y2 can carry bombs and rockets, we must discuss the attacker role of this aircraft. On new maps like Honolulu, as well as old maps like Iwo Jima, rockets will be a good pick. Rockets easily destroy cargo ships, especially ones on the move. Take the bombs on maps with light pillboxes. Use your armament only for AAA, howitzers, artillery, and lightly armoured trucks. Once all ammunition is spent, or if enemy fighters are sighted, return to the base.

[[File:D4Y2dive.png|thumb|The D4Y2 in a dive]]
Nicknamed the "Judy" by allied pilots, the D4Y2 was feared by both troops on the ground and ships in the sea.

The D4Y2 was a carrier based dive bomber. It sported a 1,400 hp "Aichi AE1P Atsuta 32" engine. The D4Y2 would see 7 variants, and was the most widely used version of the D4Y series.

Some variants had very unique roles such as the D4Y2 KAI ''Suisei Model 22,'' designed to be launched from a battleship by the means of a catapult.

With a range of 1,400 miles the D4Y2 was perfect for the defence of the Japanese territories. Combined with its extreme accuracy in a dive, it saw great success. However, with Allied aircraft upgrading from the F4F Wildcat to the F6F Hellcat, it was no longer fast enough to escape and started seeing massive casualties in missions which just months before would have had little to no casualties. The increased death rates of the pilots and crew saw pilots becoming less and less experienced, increasing the death rates even further. Slowly the time of the D4Y's was coming to an end.

No D4Y2's survived the war, but their legacy lives on as a feared a ruthless dive bomber and night fighter. Their achievements include the attack on the USS Enterprise and attack on the USS Bunker Hill which was damaged beyond repair at sea and had to return to port in the United States to repair.
