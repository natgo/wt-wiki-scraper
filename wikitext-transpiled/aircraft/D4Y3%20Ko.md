== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28IJN.29_Official_name_designation|officially designated]] the "Suisei" (Comet)) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese dive bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]].

The Suisei mod. 33A (Ko) majorly differs from its previous [[D4Y (Family)|D4Y]] variants by switching out the engine to a more reliable Mitsubishi Kinsei 62 radial engine and switched focus to land-based operations by removing the tail hook. On top of the increase in flight performance, the Model 33A Suisei comes with a [[Type 2 (13 mm)]], a license-produced variant of the German [[MG 131 (13 mm)]].

{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

While the D4Y3 switches out the inline ''Atsuta'' engine found on the first two [[D4Y (Family)|D4Y]] aircraft, for a radial ''Kinsei 62'' engine, it performs far better than the base model [[D4Y1]] but about on par with the improved inline ''Atsuta 32'' of the [[D4Y2]]. The radial engine won't overheat in combat conditions and also has a less pronounced radiator, resulting in less drag.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The [[D4Y (Family)]] lacks self-sealing fuel tanks and armour for speed and agility. As such, the D4Y3 should be treated like any other Japanese aircraft, with the utmost caution.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The bomb load-outs should be a priority for this aircraft, and the frontal machine guns should also be a module of importance. The compressor, Engine, and Injection will prove useful. After researching the engine mods, rush the Suitability modules. Only then should you tackle the turrets. The Wings Repair and Fuselage repair should come last.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 7.7 mm Type 97 navy machine guns, nose-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)

[[File:D4Y3-Ko2.png|thumb|D4Y3 in a steep dive]]

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Navy Type 97 Number 6 (60 kg)|Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 (250 kg)|Number Type 2 50 Model 1 GP(SAP) (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 1 x 250 kg Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 bomb + 2 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (370 kg total)
- 3 x 250 kg Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 bombs (750 kg total)
- 1 x 500 kg Number Type 2 50 Model 1 GP(SAP) bomb (500 kg total)
- 1 x 500 kg Number Type 2 50 Model 1 GP(SAP) bomb + 2 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (620 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Type 2 (13 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 13 mm Type 2 machine gun, dorsal turret (250 rpg)

[[File:D4Y3-Ko1.png|thumb|The D4Y3 about to destroy a medium tank]]

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The D4Y3 is an excellent example of a multirole aircraft, as it is an excellent ground attack aircraft, fighter, and bomber. Since you get a bomber air spawn, you can drop your bomb on a base and then start to engage the many fighters below you. You should have no problems engaging them, as long as you keep your speed up and your energy high. One key thing to note is that you don't need to use your defensive turret to shoo away enemy interceptors. You can easily out-turn any interceptor at that battle rating. Besides the fighter role, the ground attack is the D4Y3's natural method of play. The 500 kg bomb will be excellent for destroying Pillboxes, and you can use your rifle-calibre machine guns to destroy any soft target you please.

|}

The radiator can be kept at 0% in climbs, the D4Y3 will manage to keep cool. Open the oil radiator and radiator to 10% when levelling off, to avoid overheat after prolonged periods of time. Propeller pitch should be kept at 90-100%, and stage two of the supercharger should only be activated at 3,000 m (10,000 ft).

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

[[File:D4Y3-Ko9TURRETCLOSE.png|thumb|The D4Y3's HMG turret, which is very strong at picking off fighters. However, your primary method of defence is your manoeuvrability, not your turret]]

'''Pros:'''

- '''D'''4Y for Carrier-based dive bomber:
  ** Great bomb load-outs, can equip three 250 kg bombs, for a total weight of 750 kg
  ** Bomber airspawn, outclimbs anything and can intercept
  \*\* Airbrakes

{{main|D4Y (Family)#History|l1=D4Y History}}

Nicknamed the "Judy" by allied pilots, the D4Y3 was feared by both troops on the ground and ships in the sea.
[[File:D4Y3-Ko4.png|thumb|D4Y3 in Frozen Pass]]
The D4Y3 was converted to be a land based Dive Bomber, while its predecessor the D4Y2 was a carrier based dive bomber. The removal of the tail hook and the addition of the Mitsubishi Kinsei 62 radial engine added 150 horse power while reducing weight. The D4Y3 would see 3 variants, D4Y3 model 33, D4Y3 model 33A, and D4Y3 model 33 night-fighter.

Differences between the Model 33 and the Model 33a was the A variant had the 7.92 mm Type 1 rear-firing machine gun replaced with an upgraded 13 mm Type 2 rear-firing machine gun. With the night-fighter variant being equipped with an upwards firing 20 mm cannon. Only 3 night fighters were built as the D4Y2 night fighters were being used with success with fighters already available and assembly lines already making them.

With a range of 1,400 miles the D4Y3 was perfect for the defense of the Japanese territories. Combined with its extreme accuracy in a dive it saw great success especially in the battles at the end of the war. Notably, crippling the USS Kalinin Bay and the USS Suwannee both escort carriers. Eventually they would convert the D4Y3 into a D4Y4, which was exactly the same as the D4Y3 except it carried an un-removable 800 kg bomb for kamikaze attacks. Some D4Y4s were equipped with rockets to increase the speed at which the aircraft would strike their targets increasing the damage they caused.

No D4Y3's survived the war, but a D4Y1 was reconstructed with a Pratt and Whitney R-1830 radial engine to represent a D4Y3. This plane can be seen at the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California.
