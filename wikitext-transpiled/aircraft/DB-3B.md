<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 "Assault"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

In Simulator, the DB-3 has distinct pros and cons. It is a brilliant base / airfield-bombing plane with a maximum bombload of 1x 1,000 kg + 2x 500 kg bombs, allowing it to easily finish a base or cripple airfield modules in one run. The bombs drop one by one, allowing flexible targeting. (Note that the 1,000 kg bomb drops slightly in-front of the 500 kg bombs.) It is also one of the few USSR planes with torpedoes. It has greatly improved handling and stability comparing with the previous SB 2M, making flying a lot easier. However the DB-3 is quite slow, making it an easy target to pick on. It also has next to no defensive firepower: only 3 x 7.62 mm MGs in total; the one in the nose has great coverage, however most opponents are not likely to take head-ons. The top turret cannot even aim horizontally nor directly at the tail, meaning that the seemingly suicidal tactic of tailing a bomber can actually destroy a DB-3. The belly gun has good negative angle but its horizontal guidance is too limited. Therefore you can only target opponents at your front, upper half and lower rear.

When taking off, the DB-3 will shift to the right, so it is best to set separate keybind for left and right brakes to counter the torque. Given your weak guns, you can only survive if the room is rather empty or if the opponent also has weak firepower. If you are bombing a base, fly at treetop level to force any attacker to engage you from above so you can fight back. Bombing airfield is more dangerous, as you are not only exposed to AAA fire, but also attackers hiding in your gunner's deadzones. Climb to at least 2,000 m before approaching the airfield, then target the modules of fuel sector (surrounded by 4 towers), residential area (a bunch of tents) and hangar (6 giant houses). Bombing the airstrip is the easiest but it seems to give less rewards. If you see an attacker trying to shoot at you, you will have to nudge the plane so that the target is within your gunner's guidance which is very awful. The bullets will not do lots of damage as the target might constantly get into your deadzones. Most of the times against manoeuvring or heavily armed / armoured attackers, you will not survive long.

Landing is easy and similar to the style of the SB 2M. Line up with the airstrip when it occupies around 1/3 of your windscreen and descent to treetop level. Cut throttle to around 0-40% to drop speed to 200 km/h, and deploy landing flaps and gears. Control the throttle so that the touchdown speed is around 140km/h. Like the SB 2M, if you don't slow down enough the DB-3 will bounce off again and again which might lead to a crash. Once you have landed, you can keep braking as the nose will not dip down and cause a propeller strike.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great maximum bombload of 2 x 500 kg + 1 x 1,000 kg bombs allows you to finish a base in one go, or even have spare bombs for other targets
* Has a wide range of bomb combinations, meaning that you can choose between large and small targets
* Can break continuously until full stop, its nose will never strike the ground
* Nose turret has wide coverage

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely weak defensive firepower: terrible gun coverage at the rear/bottom, you cannot aim at planes on your side, tail, or underside, gunners are unprotected, and the 7.62 mm MGs lack damage
* Quite slow and large, making it an easy target
* Below average climb rate
* Only has landing flaps
* Negative deflection of elevator will not pitch the plane down at >390 km/h

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
After Sergei Ilyushin's BB-2 failed to compete with Tupolev's SB bomber in 1934, Ilyushin converted the BB-2 into a long-range bomber to compete again against Tupolev's DB-2 in order to recover the resources, energy, and time he had invested in the BB-2. He redesigned the BB-2, using a high-performance engine licensed by the Soviet Union in 1934, to exceed military standards.

Ilyushin began designing the prototype of the DB-3 bomber, the TSKB-26, in 1934. The TSKB-26 was actually a proof-of-concept, featuring a largely wooden fuselage, and made its first flight in the summer of 1935. It flew well and was the first Soviet aircraft to perform double aerobatics, tested by test pilot, V. K. Okkinaki. The real prototype of the DB-3 bomber, the TSKB-30, was completed in March 1936. Compared to the TSKB-26, it had an all-metal structure, extended nose, sliding cockpit canopy, fixed windshield, improved engine fairing and more. The prototype TSKB-30 was demonstrated over Moscow's Red Square on May 1, 1936, performing a 360-degree somersault with test pilot Kirkinarsky at the controls, impressing Stalin and accelerating production. On September 7, the same year, another TSKB-26 prototype set a ceiling record of flying to 11,005 metres with a payload of 2,000 kg.

From 1938 to 1939, the DB-3 bomber's aero-development system gradually changed to the Tumansky M-87A engine and VISH-3 variable pitch propeller, which became the DB-3 2M-87A (DB-3B). The M-87 had the same take-off power, but more high-altitude power output.
