== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.51 "Cold Steel"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Do 17 E-1 does not have any armour. There are 2 fuel tanks, with 1 close to each wingroot.

{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, nose-mounted (375 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|SC50JA (50 kg)|SC250JA (250 kg)|Flam C 250 incendiary}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 10 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (500 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg SC250JA bombs (500 kg total)
* 2 x Flam C 250 incendiary bombs

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, dorsal turret (750 rpg)
* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, ventral turret (375 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Do 17 E-1 can be used in two distinct methods. The pilot can dive to low altitude to reach higher speeds and use the 10 x 50 kg bombs to eliminate ground targets or it can be used as a support bomber flying behind other heavy bombers and finishing bases. This approach is dangerous and less rewarding because you are slow as you climb and fighters can easily pick you off.

Bombers capable of attacking with machine guns or cannon pods (e.g. [[B-25J-1|B-25s]] or [[Ju 87 (Family)|Ju 87s]]) can constitute early threats and any climbing fighters will easily out turn you and pick off your engines or control surfaces.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Does not frequently meet fighters armed with cannons or HMGs
* Decent payload for its rank
* Has a very short takeoff run
* Is one of the few German bombers with a machine gun armament
* Has great manoeuvrability, compared to other bombers of its rank
* Has both a dorsal and ventral gunner

'''Cons:'''

* Slow compared to other bombers, formations are difficult to maintain
* Big target
* Like most German bombers of its rank, lacks defence against any fighter
* Cannot fly with only one engine, it will be able to maintain speed and altitude only for a short time
* Light defensive armament can only protect from 4 to 8 o'clock high and vertically below

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Dornier 17 was a bomber operated by the German Luftwaffe and produced by Dornier Flugzeugwerke. Designed as a twin-engine fast bomber (Schnellbomber) as soon as 1933, its role was to perform bombing runs and then evade opposing aircraft by relying on its speed. The opposition at the time was mostly biplanes and early monoplane fighters. The initial variant of the bomber, the Do 17 E-1 variant entered production at the end of 1936. The E-1 had a low bomb load due to its small internal bomb bay and to the parasitic drag created by externally-mounted bombs. 328 Do 17 E were produced, they were operated by the Luftwaffe and the Yugoslav Air Force which had purchased 36 planes. When WW2 broke out, the Do 17 was along the He 111 one of the main bombers used by the Luftwaffe. It was used as a frontline bomber to support advancing troops, bomb enemy positions and airfields and as a reconnaissance aircraft to spot enemy columns and movements.

The Do 17 E-1 was the first Do 17 to see combat in the Spanish Civil War in 1937, in the ranks of the Condor Legion. The E-1 saw further action during the Anschluss, the Sudeten crisis and the Invasion of Poland in the ranks of the Luftwaffe. The E-1 was then converted to or replaced by more modern variants before the Invasion of France and the Low Countries.
