== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.53 "Firestorm"]]. The Do 17 Z-2 can carry more bombs than its predecessor, the [[Do 17 E-1]], and has more defensive armament. However, it retains the offensive 7.92 mm machine gun protruding from the cockpit found on the E-1.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8.5 mm steel - pilot's chair
* 8.5 mm steel - bulkhead aft of cockpit
* 6 mm steel - below belly gunner
* 6 mm steel - around top gunner
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 close to each wingroot)

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, nose-mounted (375 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|SC50JA (50 kg)|SC250JA (250 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 20 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (1,000 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg SC250JA bombs (500 kg total)
* 1 x 250 kg SC250JA bomb + 10 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (750 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, dorsal turret (750 rpg)
* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, nose turret (375 rpg)
* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, ventral turret (375 rpg)
* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, 4 x cockpit-side turrets (375 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This bomber, while not having enough payload for a base and being helpless against most fighters, makes an excellent ground attacker. Take out the convoys consisting of light tanks and unarmoured vehicles, gaining a ticket advantage for your team. It is recommended to stay at altitude until you are over the convoy you want to take out, then dive down, drop your bombs, and return to your airfield with the speed gained in the dive. After landing and rearming, try to sneak your way past the remaining fighters of the enemy team and destroy the ground targets left with your bombs and offensive armament.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Does not frequently meet cannon or HMG armed fighters
* Strong payload compared to other bombers in its rank
* Has a very short takeoff run
* Is one of the few German bombers with a machine gun armament
* Has great manoeuvrability, compared to other bombers of its rank
* Has amazing defensive armament

'''Cons:'''

* Big target
* Like most German bombers of its rank, lacks defence against any fighter
* Cannot fly with only one engine; it will be able to maintain speed and altitude only for a short time

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
