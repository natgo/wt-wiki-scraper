<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.29]].

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good payload (up to 4 x 1,000 kg)
* Quite fast and manoeuvrable for a bomber
* Can perform as both a level and dive bomber
* Very easy to fly and to land
* One of the bombers that can demolish a base (AB) or all three bases (RB/SB) with a single run
* Can be very difficult to catch once it reaches a high altitude
* Fast, with room to go even faster with upgrades installed and empty payload
* Airframe can withstand high speed
* Can be equipped with torpedoes
* Can fly with one engine, assuming the rest of the plane is undamaged

'''Cons:'''

* Poor defensive armament
* Very challenging to fly with only stock upgrades, with poor flight performance and disappointing payload
* Not very durable
* Carrying the 4,000 kg payload will add external pylons which will increase drag and reduce speed, flight performance, and climb rate
* Two of the SC1000L2s (externally-carried ones) drop at the same time in RB and SB
* Cramped cockpit and poor pilot protection
* Tail design creates a blind spot to the already underwhelming defensive armaments

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Dornier Do 217 M-1 medium twin-engine bomber

The creation of the next version of the Do 217 bomber was caused by a shortage of BMW 801 air-cooled engines. These engines were urgently needed for Fw 190A fighters and Ju 88G heavy night fighters.

In order to avoid interruptions in the production of Do 217K bombers, the Dornier Flugzeugwerke designers quickly redesigned the Do 217 K-1 to enable the installation of DB 603 liquid-cooled engines. The DB 603A twelve-cylinder, in-line, liquid-cooled engine had a takeoff power of 1,750 hp and was equipped with a 3.72 m diameter four-bladed propeller.

Due to the new engine's higher fuel consumption, the Do 217M's flight range was reduced by about 150 km. Nevertheless, other flight characteristics of the new variant proved to be better than those of the Do 217K; for example, the plane's maximum flight speed was increased. However, even without its combat load, the aircraft could fly with one working engine only if it was descending.

The Do 217M's armament and bomb capacity were the same as the Do 217K's, but a large-calibre 13 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 131 machine gun was installed in the nose-mounted turret instead of a twin 7,92 mm Mauser MG 81Z machine gun.

Some of the production machines were equipped with FuG 216 Neptun signals intelligence systems that operated in the rear hemisphere and were used to detect radar emissions from British night fighters. The FuG 216 device's antennas were mounted on the wing surfaces.

Aircraft with DB 603A and BMW 801D engines were produced simultaneously from 1942-43. The Do 217 M-1's production was discontinued in September 1943. A total of 443 Do 217 M-1 bombers were built. In 1944, 37 machines of the M-1 variant were converted to Do 217 M-11 guided weapon carriers.

In February 1944, the British managed to get one Do 217 M-1 with minimum damage. On the night of February 23, a bomber from the KG 2 squadron had been damaged by anti-aircraft gun fire over London. The crew immediately abandoned the machine, but the aircraft flew safely about 100 more kilometres and, by itself, landed on its belly near Cambridge.
