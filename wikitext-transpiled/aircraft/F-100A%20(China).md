== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (known as the 超級軍刀機 in ROCAF) was an early variant of the famous "Super Sabre". In Taiwanese service, it received a number of upgrades to bring it up to par with later models from the USAF, replacing the vertical stabilizer and avionics to [[F-100D]] standard. Compared to the fighter-bomber F-100D, it has a smaller wing with a straight trailing edge, fewer hardpoints, and no flaps. It also has an early J57P7 engine that produces less thrust than the D model's J57P21. The speed and acceleration remained comparable since the F-100A weighs less. Due to the end of major aerial combats of the Taiwan Strait Crisis, the jets were usually used during main island CAP flights or training missions; although still being a valuable supersonic fighter in ROCAF fleet, after a severe loss of maintenance crews in a plane crash in 1979 (of which most of the crew were those who had received training for F-100 maintenances), lack of spare parts, and 3 consecutive crashes involving F-100s, these jets were quickly withdrawn in 1984 and replaced by the [[F-104G (China)|F-104G]] and [[F-5E (China)|F-5E]].

Introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]], the F-100A's handling generally feels lighter than the F-100D and it enjoys a better roll rate, though the lack of flaps impacts low speed manoeuvrability. The weapons selection is inferior: while it can still has access to options like the AGM-12B Bullpup and the AIM-9E Sidewinder, its bomb selection is far more limited and it lacks access to unguided rockets. Still, it has a very solid gun armament of four 20 mm M39A1 cannons. With careful speed management, the F-100A can swoop in and swiftly take down its enemies.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

As mentioned earlier, the F-100A handles like a lighter version of the F-100D. The acceleration is decent for an early supersonic jet but falls behind some contemporary 9.7 jets such as the [[J-6A]] and [[Q-5A]], not to mention the [[J-7II]] (9.3 in RB). The top speed is about the same as the [[Q-5 early]] and lower than the F-100D. Turning performance is generally similar or improved compared to the F-100D. It can pull harder, which is helpful for snapshots, but there is also a risk of snapping the wings off in hard turns at high speed. The roll rate is improved. Controls stiffen at supersonic speeds. The low speed handling is poor and there are no flaps to help out. Turning energy retention is quite good at high subsonic speeds and not great elsewhere.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 64 mm bulletproof glass: windscreen
* 12.7 mm steel: behind pilot

For post-war fighter jets wanted to take advantage of the newer jet technology and maximize both speed and ordnance carried. To keep up speed and maximize ordnance, something had to give and that came with pilot survivability. The idea is to be faster than the enemy which would make it really difficult for them to get a targeting solution on you. Though the F-100A does have protection for the pilot, it isn't much and leaves the rest of the critical components virtually unprotected with armour. For the pilot, the back of the seat and headrest maintains a continuous piece of steel at 12.7 mm thick and the windscreen is rated at 64 mm bulletproof windscreen. Typically this type of protection is meant more for protection from defensive turret attacks from bombers rather than gun attacks from other aircraft.

The F-100A is a relatively sturdy aircraft and can take a beating before critical components begin to fail. While the engine and the pilot are important to protect as much as possible (without the engine you don't go and without the pilot…you don't go…) the wings are another critical component which you must protect as hits to the wings can make flying very difficult or send you to the respawn point. If being tailed by another aircraft try to speed away because if you try to pull up, turn to the side or pull-down, you risk exposing increased surface area of the skin, giving the enemy pilot more to shoot at and a greater opportunity of taking out a wing. If possible, increase speed and sway back and forth, even some very shallow elevator dips up and down maybe enough to throw off the sighting of the enemy pilot and spray his bullets all around you without exposing very much surface area of the jet, however, if there is a missile launch, take evasive action to avoid the missile and worry about the guns later.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M39A1 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm M39A1 cannons, chin-mounted (200 rpg = 800 total)

The M39A1 cannons are one of the F-100A's main selling points. They are revolver cannons with a rapid rate of fire, high muzzle velocity, and good stopping power. The four of them together provide a burst mass that approaches the [[M61 (20 mm)|M61 Vulcan]] without any spool-up delay and the ammo supply of 200 rounds per gun is quite generous.

The Ground Targets belt is a good all-round choice. Its AP-I rounds deal heavy kinetic damage with a high fire chance and the sheer volume of bullets will make short work of air targets. Thinly armoured ground targets such as light tanks and SPAAs are also easy prey. Other belts are still good options against air targets for those desiring HE rounds and explosive damage.

=== Suspended armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{Navigation-End}}

The F-100A can be equipped with AIM-9B and AIM-9E Sidewinder missiles for air-to-air combat. They have poor tracking and manoeuvrability, so an attentive opponent can dodge them with a single well-timed turn. Still, they are helpful on occasion and give the F-100A more flexibility. Up to 4 can be carried, which is a capacity advantage over the J-6A and J-7II.

The F-100A does not have many options for ground attack, which reflects its status as a dedicated fighter model retrofitted with new ordnance as opposed to the F-100D, which was designed from the outset to lug around literal tons of bombs and rockets. The two hardpoints can carry two bombs or two AGM-12B air-to-ground missiles. In the bomb department, neither the 750 lb nor 1000 lb bombs are adequate for serious base-bombing in Air RB, but the latter can do some decent work against ground vehicles. The Bullpups are keyboard-guided MCLOS missiles that are a common sight on US jet aircraft. They take some practice to use, but once mastered they allow the F-100A to engage enemy tanks and ground vehicles from several kilometers away for precise and safe kills. Many of the later ROCAF aircraft such as the [[F-104G (China)|F-104G]] also feature Bullpups, so the F-100A offers a good platform to get familiar with them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Air Battles'''
The F-100A is an early supersonic jet. Its speed, acceleration, and high speed handling are not the greatest for its battle rating, where it often faces much more advanced aircraft, but it does have lethal weapons and enough good qualities to get by. It is important to know the strengths and weaknesses of its opponents.

The general playstyle for the Super Sabres is to build up speed and try to maintain it, because once it is gone, the poor low-speed handling becomes a major issue and the subpar acceleration makes it hard to recover quickly. At the start of the match, it is generally a good idea to fly to the side and avoid entering battle directly. This gives the F-100A time to build speed, altitude, and energy without getting surprised by fast or airspawned opponents. Enter combat at high speed and look for vulnerable targets. Enemies that are flying in straight lines can be surprised with an AIM-9B. If they are manoeuvring and/or aware of your position, the guns might work better. The F-100A can turn well enough in the short term to credibly threaten most opponents and the excellent guns will seal the deal if you can outplay them, but remember to manage its speed as the situation requires: fly too quickly and there will be issues with control compression and wing overload, fly too slowly and the F-100A will be in trouble as stated before. Take advantage of the improved roll rate compared to the F-100D in rolling scissors manoeuvres.

Air-to-air missiles are an issue because the F-100A has no countermeasures. Early missiles like the AIM-9B and R-3S are easy to dodge by turning, but doing so will force the F-100A to lose some speed and energy. The F-100A can outrun missiles if they are launched from some distance away, so this is another reason to maintain speed. Perform some light manoeuvres to drain the missile's energy as necessary. Be wary of opponents with deadly missiles, such as the [[Su-25]]/[[Su-25K|K]] with all-aspect, highly agile R-60Ms, and avoid engaging them in head-ons.

'''Ground Battles'''

The F-100A is a handy accompaniment to ground lineups as well. It is the first aircraft in the Chinese tech tree with access to air-to-ground missiles and its supersonic speed makes it easier to dodge gunfire and fly to and from the airfield in between sorties. The two Bullpups can destroy enemies from safe distances (2-3 km away) upon a direct hit or near miss. This does require some good eyesight or spotting assistance by friendly light tanks. The missile capacity is low, but the F-100A can stick around for gun runs if there are no SPAAs around or otherwise quickly return to base to restock. Despite not being an attacker aircraft, the F-100A is more practical for CAS than the PLAAF [[Q-5 early]]. The [[Q-5A]] is somewhat superior with its ballistic computer, countermeasures, and larger payload, but the F-100A's Bullpups are still the best for precise and powerful long-range attacks.

Be on the lookout for SAM vehicles because they may be able to engage the F-100A even from long distances, and the F-100A cannot drop chaff to disrupt radar locks or spoof IR missiles. If you spot a missile launch, perform evasive manoeuvres and try to keep a low profile while the vehicle is still around.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The F-100A is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

In the early Cold War era, the Republic of China Air Force was equipped with US jet aircraft like the [[F-86F-30 (China) | F-86 Sabre]] and [[F-84G-21-RE_(China) | F-84 Thunderjet]], which were used in clashes with the People's Republic of China over the Taiwan Straits. Amid growing conflict in 1958, a number of assorted F-100 Super Sabres were delivered to Taiwan, including the F-100A, the two-seat F-100F, and the reconnaissance RF-100A. The former were upgraded with a number of features from the latest F-100D, such as a taller vertical tail fin and wiring for Sidewinder missiles. Another batch of F-100s was delivered in the 1970s and the type remained in service until the 1980s.

The F-100 was not an easy aircraft to handle and several were lost in accidents. The details of their combat experiences are unclear. They may have fought with PLAAF jets but it is unknown if any kills or losses were scored. The RF-100As in particular were only used for about two years before being returned to the United States due to unsatisfactory capabilities and maintenance issues. The ROCAF was the only foreign user of the F-100A.
