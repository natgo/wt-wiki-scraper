== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', colloquially known as 超級軍刀機 (Super Sabre jet), was the twin-seater variant of F-100 and in fact the very first supersonic jet in ROCAF service which served until 1984; these jets were mostly identical to USAF variants minus INS for SEAD capabilities (F-100F is also the first Wild Wiesel jet). As part of the Military Aid Program (MAP) to ROCAF without any supersonic jet by August 1958 during the 1st Taiwan Strait Crisis, USAF immediately transferred six F-100F to ROCAF with four upcoming jets by September after the heat; meanwhile the single-seater [[F-100A (China)|F-100A]] with upgrades from the D series also arrived to ROCAF between 1958 to 1970. Due to the soon arrival of [[F-104 (Family)|F-104]] fleet by 1960s and the passage of major aerial combats between ROCAF/PLAAF, these F-100F were usually served as the trainer jet for pilots, CAP and ground attacker thanks to its sufficient performance for main island operations. However, due to a transporter crash in 1979 that costed almost all F-100 engineers in ROCAF and consecutive crashes involved the fleet of F-100s, they were soon phrased out by the last squadron that operated it by 1984, likely been replaced by later series F-104G or [[F-5E (China)|CKD assembled F-5E by AIDC]]. 

Introduced during [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8494-event-tokushu-heiki-assemble-and-test-an-honorable-missile-to-obtain-prizes-en|2023 Tokushu Heiki event]] and the first aerial main prize of seasonal event of Chinese tech-tree, F-100F now further extends its combat capability than ROCAF's F-100A thanks to its better payload for ground attack; while it can cause extensive damage to ground targets, be sure to take extra caution on enemy jets as most supersonic jets of its tier will not have a hard time taking down F-100F. Even though 2 cannons were removed from the nose, the ballistic performance of M39 and up to 4 AIM-9E can make sure it would still have the chance to turn the tides with its somewhat good AoA that is traded with its speed.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Aside from the rear-seat, F-100F looks mostly identical to any other F-100 series in game especially its signature "catfish" intake. In this case, F-100F will be quite different from ROCAF's F-100A especially on its weight due to its F-100D based design - the D variant can be said as a multirole fighter while the F variant added a rear-seat for the weapon officer, therefore the weight of the extra pilot and extended cockpit should be considered as well. The other difference is the lack of a pair of autocannons than the A/D series, so half the firepower in this case. Compare to its arch enemy - [[MiG-19 (Family)|MiG-19]], it is very certain that F-100F at such huge size will have very hard time following the path of Farmers during a dogfight; but this huge size also gives F-100F a feature which is higher AoA when used in combination with the speed brake, although it trades lots of the energy and could be fatal at frontline, if players do need extra AoA to line-up the shots on enemy targets when 1 vs 1, this could be a "reverse" card for F-100F at such situation. Oddly enough, although having some extra weights, F-100F is still slightly faster than the A variant with upgraded engine (ROCAF received overhaul upgraded F-100A with F-100D equivalent equipment).

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
* 64 mm bulletproof glass: windscreen
* 12.7 mm steel: behind pilots 

Jets at the dawn of supersonic still have some extend of protection for the pilot even though the abundance of autocannons by the Warsaw-Pact jets; the protection of F-100F is mostly identical to other F-100 series other having additional protection for the Weapon System Officer (aka rear-pilot); while autocannons more than 20 mm calibre can tear down the pilots with ease, earlier jets with only machine guns will need more precise hits on pilots or sustained hits on F-100F airframe to send it to kingdom come.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Supersonic and slightly faster than F-100A
* Can sometimes trades speed for higher AoA (for "snap shot")
* Weapon System Officer (WSO; or rear-pilot) has access to aircraft control for last-ditch retaliation
* Higher and more extensive payload for multirole operations than F-100 series with (wing-mounted) chaffs
* Good ballistics for the M39 autocannon
* RWR for better situational awareness at its BR

*

'''Cons:'''

* Heavier airframe than earlier F-100 series thus less manoeuvrable 
* Lacks a pair of autocannon than previous F-100 series
* Control surfaces lock up at supersonic speeds
* Any maneuvers will bleeds the energy severely 
* Lack ballistic computer for precise ground attack
