== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', colloquially known as the 超級軍刀機 (Super Sabre jet), was the twin-seater variant of the F-100 and the first supersonic jet in ROCAF service, serving until 1984. These jets were mostly identical to USAF variants minus INS for SEAD capabilities (the F-100F was also the first Wild Weasel jet). During the 2nd Taiwan Strait Crisis in August 1958, the USAF transferred six F-100Fs to the ROCAF under the Military Aid Program (MAP), with four more jets by September. Due to the arrival of the [[F-104 (Family)|F-104]] to the ROCAF in the 1960s and the lack of major aerial combat between the ROCAF and PLAAF, the F-100Fs usually served as trainers, CAP, and ground attackers. However, due to a transporter crash in 1979 that cost almost all the F-100 engineers in ROCAF and consecutive crashes involving the fleet of F-100s, they were soon phased out with the last squadron them until 1984, replaced by later series [[F-104G (China)|F-104Gs]] or [[F-5E (China)|AIDC-assembled F-5Es]].

Introduced during [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8494-event-tokushu-heiki-assemble-and-test-an-honorable-missile-to-obtain-prizes-en|2023 Tokushu Heiki event]], the F-100F extends its combat capability over the preceding F-100A thanks to its better payload for ground attack. While it can cause extensive damage to ground targets, be sure to take extra caution against enemy jets, as most supersonic jets of its tier will not have a hard time taking down the F-100F. Even though two cannons were removed from the nose, the ballistic performance of the M39 and up to four AIM-9Es ensures that it still has the chance to turn the tides with its somewhat good AoA that is traded with its speed.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Aside from the rear-seat, the F-100F looks mostly identical to any other F-100 series in the game, especially with its signature "catfish" intake. However, it handles quite differently from the tech-tree F-100A, especially due to its weight - the F variant adds a rear seat for the weapons officer, therefore the weight of the extra pilot and extended cockpit should be considered as well.

The F-100F has a very hard time following the path of its arch enemy, the [[MiG-19 (Family)|MiG-19]], in a dogfight. However, due to its larger wings, the F-100F is able to pull greater AoA at low-medium speeds, though at the cost of a significant amount of energy, which may allow it to come out on top if used to its advantage in key situations.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 64 mm bulletproof glass: windscreen
* 12.7 mm steel: behind pilots

Jets at the dawn of the supersonic era still have some extent of protection for the pilot despite the abundance of heavy autocannons on Warsaw-Pact aircraft. The protection of F-100F is mostly identical to other the F-100 series, other than having additional protection for the Weapon System Officer (aka rear-pilot). While autocannons more than 20 mm calibre can knock out the pilots with ease, earlier jets with only machine guns will need more precise hits on pilots or sustained hits on the airframe to send it to back to the hangar.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Weapon System Officer (WSO; or rear-pilot) has access to aircraft control for last-ditch retaliation
* Higher and more extensive payload for multirole operations than F-100 series including (wing-mounted) chaffs
* Good ballistics for the M39 autocannon
* RWR for better situational awareness at its BR

'''Cons:'''

* Heavier airframe than earlier F-100 series thus less manoeuvrable
* Lacks a pair of autocannons compared to the previous F-100 series
* Control surfaces lock up at supersonic speeds
* Any manoeuvres will severely bleed energy
* Lacks ballistic computer for precise ground attack
