== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]]. Designed for pure speed and acceleration, the F-104C is one of the fastest planes at its BR, but its terrible manoeuvrability relegates it to the role of support fighter.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
In terms of armour, there is no armour on the F-104C. Since the F-104C relies on high speed, it wouldn't need armour as that would reduce the speed and manoeuvrability of the plane. The F-104C is a very long plane and it is not very manoeuvrable, making it a large, easy target for enemy guns. As such, the only characteristic that should be relied upon for survivability is the plane's speed. It is very quick, and as such is hard to catch.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The F-104 is an interceptor which relies solely on its high speed and acceleration. This great speed comes with a great cost; the F-104 undoubtedly has the worst overall turn rate at high tiers (and perhaps in the whole game as well). Keep that in mind when playing it. It is highly recommended not to dogfight in the F-104 as you aren't out-turning anything, and even if you have someone energy trapped, it is hard to capitalize on it as the F-104's manoeuvrability is just so poor. Additionally, if someone gets on your tail, there isn't much you can do. While the F-104 does have a good roll rate, the turning capability makes it so it cannot effectively perform defensive manoeuvres. Even if you manage to get a tailing enemy to overshoot, the F-104 can't turn well enough to use the opportunity to attack.

Due to this, the best way to play the F-104 is to keep its speed up as much as possible and at all times. You will want to play the F-104 primarily in the support role as either a boom and zoom fighter or a hit and run fighter, picking on slow enemies that are preferably distracted and already engaged in a dogfight with teammates. This strategy prioritizes that no enemy get on the F-104's tail, because as discussed before, there is little one can do once this happens. This also means that the F-104 is very team-reliant in most battles, as it does not fare well in any 1v1 scenario.

The F-104C will do best in downtiers as it will be one of the fastest if not the fastest planes. Therefore, you can prioritize the high-threat planes first before handling the slower jets. Fast planes and planes with excellent missiles like the [[MiG-19S (Germany)|MiG-19S]], [[MiG-21F-13]], [[Yak-38]], [[Yak-38M]], [[A-5C]], etc. should be prioritized as main threats.

In an uptier, the F-104 quickly becomes outclassed. Most other fighters can at least keep up with its speed while also having better missiles. A full uptier is your worst nightmare as most planes do pretty much everything better than you. On top of that, your lack of flares means that most potent air-to-air missiles found in an uptier (AIM-9Js, R-60/R-60Ms, Magic 1s) mean a nearly unavoidable death. This means that in uptiers, it will be the same support strategy as discussed before, except you will need to be much more cautious. The one and only thing you have is, again, your speed, which is luckily still competitive even up to 11.0. It will be especially important to keep this speed as high as possible at all times. To avoid missiles, you will want to keep your distance from enemies while being cautious and waiting for the right opportunity to strike. Again, slow and/or distracted enemies will ideally be your targets. Attack when you are sure no one can or will bother to follow you or launch a missile at you.

The F-104C's air-to-air armament is great. For its gun, it gets the powerful M61 Vulcan rotary cannon. This is arguably one of the best aircraft guns in the game and sports extremely high rate of fire, high velocity, and high damage. Its only downside is that it only gets 750 rounds of ammunition; while it may seem like a lot, the cannon's extreme fire rate sees that it gets depleted quicker than one would expect. Since this will be your primary weapon when engaging enemy fighters, you should maintain trigger discipline when using it. As for your missiles, you have two AIM-9B Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These are the basic air-to-air missile and as such aren't very strong. They don't turn well and are sensitive to flares. Due to this, they shouldn't be your main weapon, but they are better than nothing, and can sometimes be useful. They should be launched only when needed, such as at long ranges, at distracted enemies, or to make an enemy drop speed.

In the ground attack role, there are many better choices than the F-104C (such as the AV-8C, F-100D or A-4E), though the F-104C isn't completely helpless when it comes to the task. It can carry either 3x 750lb bombs, 38x FFAR rockets, or 2x Napalm bombs. Since only 38 rockets can be carried (which even in higher quantities aren't very powerful), it isn't recommended to take them. Napalm can be used to bomb bases in air RB, but in ground RB it has little overall use and shouldn't be taken. This leaves the only acceptable option being the 3x 750lb bombs. These 750lb bombs have an adequate explosion size which is enough to reliably destroy tanks. The two wing-mounted bombs drop together first, followed by the single centerline one, giving two bomb drops. Since the F-104C lacks the luxury of a ballistic computer, you must manually calculate the point of impact for the bombs and rockets. Additionally, the M61 Cannon has decent penetration and can be used to attack lighter targets or the roofs of MBTs, and the two wingtip AIM-9B sidewinders can be taken with any of these for some semblance of multi-role capability. After you drop the bombs, you can either use the cannon for strafing, or you can use the cannon and missiles to engage enemy aircraft (the M61 cannon is great for taking out helicopters).The F-104C's speed will help it get in and out of the battlefield quickly, and the RWR is a helpful tool to alert you of SPAA and SAMs. Keep the F-104C's bad manoeuvrability in mind when doing ground attack runs, as it will prove fatal if you don't pull up in time.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APS-19}}-->
The F-104C is equipped with an AN/ASG-14 search and tracking radar. The radar is mounted in the nose of the aircraft.

The brainchild of famed Lockheed engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, after having spoken to USAF pilots about their experience in the Korean Air War, the F-104 Starfighter was innovative in both its design and speed. Developed from the start as a daytime air-superiority fighter with speed in mind, the Starfighter began life at Lockheed's famous "Skunk Works" facility in 1952 to combat the Soviets' new age of supersonic jet fighters. The aircraft would incorporate the smallest airframe, combined with the most technologically advanced turbojet at the time, to create the base of what would become the F-104.

In 1953, the USAF showed interest in the project, and proposed an open contest with Lockheed and multiple other firms for a supersonic interceptor, based wholly on performance. Lockheed evidently won the contest and approval for two prototypes to be produced and, in February of 1954, took flight for the first time. Although it was slated to be fitted with the General Electric J79 turbofan, due to shortages of the engines the prototypes were mated to a license-built variant of the British Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engine, called the Wright XJ65-W-6, until the initial power-plant was available. The aircraft however was not without its problems, resulting in a four-year long developmental period for the aircraft. By the end of it, 17 pre-production YF-104As had been built, tested, and used to iron out any problems that would be noticeable on the final F-104. In 1958, the F-104 would finally be available for deliveries featuring some differences from the initial prototypes in the form of a longer fuselage as well as the fitting of General Electric J79GE-3 engines putting out a whopping 14,800 lbs of thrust.

From the start the F-104A smashed records, taking the record as the first operational fighter in service to succeed Mach 2, as well as going on to take the records for both altitude and speed in both the F-104A and F-104C variants respectively. On May 7th, 1958, Maj. Howard C. Johnson, in his F-104A, set a new world altitude record at 91,243 feet, and 11 days later another aircraft set a new speed record at 1,403.19 mph. The altitude record was later bested by another variant of the aircraft, the F-104C, at a whopping altitude of 103,389 feet. In the 1950s, the aircraft had come to be exactly what the public had expected a fighter of this magnitude to look like. With a long, pencil shaped fuselage with short, sharp edged wings it encompassed the era of space flight and Sci-Fi with its design. The wings were one of the most unique parts of the aircraft, as well as its long fuselage taken up mostly by its large engine and fuel storage, and were only 4 inches and its thickest. Sweeping was only utilized on the leading edge, and a slight anhedral was in place to combat "Dutch Roll", a phenomenon where the aircraft rocks side-to-side uncontrollably. The wings, while helping with supersonic flight, were harmful to ground crews, and special equipment had to be issued to service these areas.

While having a history of accidents and high pilot attrition, the aircraft was fitted with an ejection seat. Due to the great speed of the aircraft at Mach 2, it was believed that the seat wouldn't have enough time to clear the tail section in an ejection scenario. Therefore, a downward firing ejection seat known as the Stanley C-1 was fitted into early models of the F-104. While a good idea, and in theory could work, the C-1 was also believed harmful in the case of a low-altitude ejection of the aircraft. After a failed introduction of the Stanley C-2 ejection seat, the problem was finally solved by the introduction of the Martin-Baker ejection system, particularly in foreign-operator's Starfighters. Roughly 153 F-104As were produced, with 26 more being F-104B two-seat variants. The F-104A spend a short time in USAF service before being send to Air National Guard (ANG) units, which some others being sent to foreign operators which had some success in their service. In September of 1958 the USAF would get the F-104C, a dedicated fighter-bomber variant designed for the USAF's Tactical Air Command's 479th Tactical Fighter Squadron. The F-104C featured improvements over the F-104A in the form of a better fire-control system as well as hardpoints on the centerline on the belly and under the wings. The aircraft also introduced the ability to refuel mid-flight via a probe running along the right side of the aircraft, extending the reach of the aircraft somewhat. However, like most of the A models ended up, the C models were quickly transferred to Air National Guard (ANG) units both of which served until around 1975 in their service. The first combat of the F-104 however wouldn't be seen until the Vietnam War, and while not having any kills to count was successful in keeping MiGs back and from intercepting friendly aircraft. The aircraft had a short service life in this theatre, only serving in 1965, and again from 1967-1969 until the introduction of the more-capable F-4 Phantom II by which it was replaced.

=== [[wt:en/news/6731-development-f-104-starfighter-the-manned-missile-en|Devblog]] ===
The development history of the F-104 Starfighter begins in 1951, when Lockheed's lead engineer visited US pilots in Korea. The feedback given to Johnson was clear - US planes were too large and complex and would often find themselves inferior to the much smaller and simpler Soviet MiG-15. On his return to the United States, Johnson assembled a team of engineers and started developing an aircraft that would address the concerns of the pilots.

The result of this undertaking was the F-104 Starfighter, whose first prototype, designated XF-104, first took to the skies on the 4th March 1954. Although both prototypes were lost during testing, the results delivered by the prototypes were promising enough for the USAF to accept the aircraft into service in November 1955.

Soon after entering production, the F-104 quickly also became a highly popular aircraft on the export market. West Germany was, alongside the United States, the primary operator of the Starfighter, owning over 900 F-104s in its air force  at the peak of its service career. However, 13 other nations also employed the F-104 such as Canada, Italy, Japan, Spain, and many more.

The F-104 saw most of its combat service with the USAF, most notably taking part in the Vietnam War. Furthermore, the F-104 also saw combat during the Indo-Pakistani Wars in the mid '60s - early '70s while flying under Pakistani colors.

In the end, over 2,500 Starfighters would be built, with most being gradually decommissioned by the end of the Cold War. Italy was the last to decommission its F-104s in the early 2000s.
