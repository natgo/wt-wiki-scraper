== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]].

Belgium operated a fleet of around 100 F-104Gs between 1963 and 1983. Except for the very first aircraft, all F-104Gs for the Belgian Air Force were produced locally in Belgium by SABCA who also produced some for the German Air Force. The F-104G would be the main fighter of the Belgian Air Force until they were replaced by the F-16A. After retirement, they were mainly placed into storage, with around 20 being sold to Turkey and a couple sold to Taiwan.

This specific F-104G, FX-99, was the last flying Belgian F-104G during its retirement. It is currently privately owned and was recently restored back to flying conditions.
