== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

The Italian-exported F-104S to Turkey; although the F-104 series are deemed obsolete at this tier, especially in terms of its doctrine of trading manoeuvrability for high speed and climb rate, if used with caution to more advanced jets, it is still capable in combat with a large amount of A2A weaponry against unaware targets.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The vehicle itself is totally identical to its [[F-104S|tech-tree counterpart]] but with Turkish markings. One of the most distinctive features of the F-104 series is the pencil-like airframe with extremely thin and small control surfaces: the F-104S is no exception. It also carries an engine with very similar thrust to the J79-GE-17 of the [[F-4E Phantom II|F-4 Phantom]], making it even faster than previous models. However, this increase in thrust doesn't change the drawback of the F-104 series - its manoeuvrability. Due to the design calling for the highest possible climb rate to counter Soviet bombers and earlier jets of its era (e.g. [[MiG-19 (Family)|MiG-19]]), it has some of the thinnest wings of any jet aircraft. Although it has a pair of flaps able to be extended even at 900 km/h for extra manoeuvrability, in most cases, if the target is not something as huge as a [[B-29A-BN|B-29 Superfortress]], chances are that players may get drawn into energy fights with enemies which could be extra challenging to handle due to the infamous lack of manoeuvrability. Be sure not to be baited into a dogfight, and finish an engagement as fast as possible as more speed means more odds to survive the battle.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

Like its tech tree counterpart, the TAF F-104S also has no additional protection against oncoming shots. What makes the situation even mpre dire is that it also doesn't equip an EFS onboard: in case of an engine fire, players will have to pray that it burns out naturally before structural failure. In most cases, with the engine damaged by different means or other damage onboard, the F-104S will have an extremely hard time returning for a repair.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Being a member of the Starfighter family, the F-104S excels excellently at its main feature - speed and climb rate. As one of the earliest jets to hit Mach 2.0 at high altitude, the design doctrine called for the maximum climb rate and speed possible, resulting in the pencil-like airframe. Players will soon find it very different from other jets of its tier: while those jets would still have the chance to succeed in a dogfight to a certain extent, this is not the case for F-104S. The jet itself does have varieties of air-to-air weaponries, such as later series of rear-aspect Sidewinders and even Sparrows at its disposal, the jet itself does also come with an M61 cannon on the port side of the airframe. At first glance this might sound pleasing as there are 6 missiles in total for the jet, but when players decided to equip AIM-7Es, they will find that the only cannon onboard is removed to fit the Sparrow guidance equipment.

The other thing that hinders F-104S is the radar itself. It does have 30 km search range but the scan rate is slow compared to jets at its tier; the overall performance of this radar also hindered as the Sparrow has difficulty handling targets below it - a major drawback for an interceptor. For most air-to-air combats, bringing 6 AIM-9s is more than enough to handle the heated battlefield when delivering strikes upon unaware enemies; if players want to take a bet on head-on fights against targets from below, the pair of Sparrows will make short work of enemies assuming the missiles do track on the target, but make sure every missile counts as these will be the only weapons onboard. However, the high velocity and rate of fire of the M61 cannon is also often enough to deal with head-on situations.

The F-104S should be used for high-altitude interception or going fast at lower altitudes, being fast helps its survivability; going fast and flying in mostly straight lines around the battlefield, picking off targets that have used up their energy or don't have any flares for the maximum efficiency. Only engage in a dogfight in dire situations or one-on-one battles; use the flaps accordingly as this can compensate for the poor manoeuvrability at speeds below 900 km/h.

While Starfighters are infamous at ground-attacking due to its lack of manoeuvrability at low altitude, the F-104S is able to carry up to 1.36 tons of LDGP bombs or napalm. Players will have to be extremely cautious about their position, diving onto targets or being too fast in this case is not a good idea for F-104S. The ballistic computer will make sure the bombs land on desired targets precisely.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Rather high acceleration and climb rate than previous models
- Varieties of air-to-air/ground weaponry with sufficient overall payload
- Sufficient counter-measures for oncoming missiles
- Relative high ammo pool for its M61 cannon
- High roll-rate at high speed

'''Cons:'''

- Installation of AIM-7 missiles trades the internal M61 cannon
- Huge turning radius
- Way high stall speed than conventional jets
- Somewhat inferior radar at its tier with a slow scan rate

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

During the heat of the Cold War when the Cuban Missile Crisis almost brought an end to the world, Turkey, a site of US missile bases overseas, would become the frontline and in dire need for new jets. Later in May 1963, TAF received their first 54 F-104G series from the Military Aid Program (MAP; 48 104Gs and 6 TF-104Gs); this also included hundreds of other F-104G series from other NATO countries where they would be eventually replaced by their selected new jets by the 1980s. Aside from Lockheed and Canadair F-104s, Turkey also became the only export customer of the F-104S series at a total of 40 of them delivered in late 1974 to May 1975.

Their only combat operation was the Invasion of Cyprus where they could have encountered Starfighters from their neighbour across the Aegean Sea, Greece, but both air forces didn't meet each other and the F-104 series were kept in service until TAI's license-assembled F-16Cs arrived and eventually replaced them in the mid-1990s.<ref>Baugher, Joe.
