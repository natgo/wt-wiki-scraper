== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

The F-104S.ASA is an Italian supersonic interceptor based on the American [[F-104 (Family)|Lockheed F-104 "Starfighter"]] series. The external appearance is much the same besides the additional ventral fins, but as the final variant of the Starfighter family, it boasts the best speed and payload capacity of any F-104. It can be used as a high-speed ground attacker with a sizeable load of assorted bombs and rockets. Alternatively, it can be a deadly interceptor if equipped with air-to-air missiles. Unique among Starfighters is its ability to carry a pair of Selenia Aspide semi-active radar homing missiles.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The F-104S.ASA is not equipped with any armour plating, and is therefore rather vulnerable to enemy fire, especially given the fact that most enemies at this rank sport high-calibre cannons. Taking any critical damage in the F-104S.ASA will almost instantly cripple it, to the point where you will have to fly back to base, or be a sitting duck for the enemy team. Taking a critical hit to the fuselage will disable you so badly you won't be able to reach supersonic speeds, which is your greatest advantage. The same goes for taking any sort of wing damage or tail damage: it will instantly result in a huge amount of drag on the air frame, reducing your already poor energy retention in manoeuvres making you an easy target to pick off from afar and in effective gun range. Lastly, the engine is a massive target for guns and missiles alike. Having a slightly orange engine will effectively put you out of the fight. And with the already heavy weight of the F-104S.ASA, you require the engine power to stay in the fight.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The one thing the F-104S.ASA does extremely well is speed, it is one of the vehicle's greatest advantage, and can be used to great effect if the pilot is careful about choosing which engagements to pursue. It is recommended to keep up a high air-speed at all times, which will allow the F-104S.ASA to swoop in and out of the combat zone while evading enemies. Sometimes, it is even possible to outrun enemy air-to-air missiles.

However, the F-104S.ASA struggles with manoeuvrability. With such small wings, it simply can't produce the lift necessary to throw itself around the sky, and therefore has a very poor turning circle. This means that any turning engagement is most likely futile, and also re-emphasises the utility of a boom and zoom playstyle.

When used in conjunction with its speed, the available armaments really allow the F-104S.ASA to shine. The AIM-9Ls, already difficult to dodge with their good manoeuvrability and flare-resistance, become nigh-on impossible to avoid when launched at supersonic speeds, particularly against much slower targets. The Selenia Aspide can also be a welcome addition in a high-altitude, long-range, all-aspect engagement however you will have to compromise for the 20mm Vulcan. Speaking of which, the extremely accurate and powerful M61A1 Vulcan cannon can be used instead for quick head-ons and to mop any remaining opponents at close-range.

The F-104S.ASA is able to bring countermeasures to give it a fighting chance against the top dogs of the air. Your main enemies will be aircraft such as the [[F-14A Early|F-14 Tomcat]] or the [[MiG-27K|MiG-27]], it's best to try and avoid close engagements and instead focus on picking people from afar. As previously mentioned, you will not be able to turn well at high speeds so make sure that every person you engage won't become a threat if things don't go your way.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Excellent top speed and acceleration
- Fantastic climb rate
- All-aspect AIM-9Ls have very good tracking, range, and turning capability
- Equipped with Aspide-1A SARH missiles with great tracking and range as well as a look-down/shoot-down radar
- Equipped with 60 countermeasures

'''Cons:'''

- Very poor manoeuvrability
- M61A1 cannon cannot be carried when Aspide missiles are equipped
- No guided air-to-ground weaponry
- RWR only alerts you of radar pings/locks; it does not show what direction they come from
- The ACM mode of the radar only has a range of 4KMs,being difficult to lock in head ons or environments with a lot of interference from the other planes
- The radar does not have an adjustable horizontal scan angle,and having a slow scan

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

{{main|F-104S#History|l1=History of the F-104S}}
An upgrade program was carried out in the 1980s while the Italian military was working on the Eurofighter Typhoon, resulting in the F-104S-ASA (Amodernamento Sistema Arma; "Weapon Systems Upgrade"). The ASA is differentiated by the additions of the AIM-9L Sidewinder missile and the Italian Selenia Aspide semi-active radar homing missile. The avionics, countermeasure systems, and weapons were improved, however the cannon could not be carried along with the missile guidance equipment due to improvements in avionics. The ASA was also tested with Flare and Chaff pods, which was also one of the notable improvements over the S variant. The ASA would be updated once more beginning in 1995-1997 to the ASA/M standard. The changes were relatively minor and limited to the addition of modern AIM-9Ls, overhauling the electrical system, and adding new navigation features. These changes also resulted in a pure interceptor and therefore could not carry rockets or bombs.
