== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Following the exposition of the shortcomings of the current fighter aircraft of the United States in the 1960s, particularly shown during the Vietnam War, the U.S. Department of Defense set out to procure a versatile, long-range strike aircraft to meet the demands of the Cold War for both the US Navy and Air Force. The F-111 project was born as a joint effort between the Air Force and Navy, aiming to create a multi-role aircraft capable of performing both strategic and tactical missions in USAF doctrine and for Navy "fleet defence and strike" doctrine, resulting in the F-111 development program being one of the most comical rollercoaster rides in the world of military aviation. After many shortcomings, failures, and cancellations of certain aspects of the program, primarily the F-111K (UK export variant) and F-111B (US Navy fleet defence fighter) being cancelled, the development shifted to solely focus on the USAF frontline-bomber variant. Though the F-111 program faced numerous challenges and controversies, it eventually evolved into an impressive aircraft known for its adaptability and innovative technology. The initial chapter in this story, the F-111A, was just the tip of the spear, and the advent of a long and notable history of the "Aardvark" family.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a heavy frontline bomber and low-altitude interdictor, introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. Building upon the doctrine and playstyle of previous aircraft in the bomber line, primarily the previous F-105D, the F-111A borrows many of its mission profiles, and as such has a similar set of advantages and disadvantages against its adversaries. The F-111 is characterized by being the extreme of most ends in-game, being the fastest aircraft in-game at the time of its introduction, at a Battle Rating where nothing can even dream of catching you at your max speed. However, reaching that max speed is another story, as the Pratt & Whitney TF-30 engines, familiar to pilots of the [[F-14A Early]], have abysmal acceleration, which when coupled with the high-drag airframe, means that the F-111A bleeds energy dangerously quickly in any manoeuvre. However, do not let these donwnsides deter you from the venerable 'Vark, as in the hands of a more experienced player, it can be a very dangerous fighter at its battle rating, utilizing its good top speed and great manoeuvrability at low speed to win almost all engagements it finds itself in. If all else fails, the F-111 can resort to bombing bases thanks to its highly respectable ordnance load, capable of leveling up to seven bases in Air Realistic Battles when fully loaded with bombs. In ground battles, the F-111 can function as a precision interdictor thanks to its small selection of precision weapons and bomb computer, or more likely, as an area-level frontline strike aircraft, thanks to its capability to carpet bomb with up to fifty bombs, or hammer a smaller area with its 456x FFAR rockets.

'''Players must take caution when taking any ordnance on the outermost four pylons, as this configuration locks the wings in forward sweep and turns the F-111 into a subsonic bomb truck.'''

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The greatest advantage for the F-111 Aardvark in terms of survivability is its raw speed. Although its acceleration is mediocre with any sort of payload, it has an extremely high top speed when moving in a straight line, and can outrun many aircraft without needing to ditch its bombs to do so as long as it was already moving fast.

The greatest disadvantage in terms of survivability for the F-111 is the sheer size of the aircraft and the fact that fuel and the engines takes up an extremely large portion of the internal aircraft volume. This means that any enemy fighters within gun range will not have a very hard time hitting something critical and starting a fire.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* One of the fastest aircraft in-game, with a maximum airspeed of 1500kph (~930mph) IAS with maximum wing sweep.
* Extremely heavy payload capacity (currently, the heaviest payload capacity in-game).
* CCIP and CCRP bomb computer, CCIP rocket and cannon computer, radar has lead-computing cannon FCS.
* Powerful Vulcan with 2,000 rounds
* MAW (Missile Approach Warning) can detect missiles approaching from the rear, and, optionally drop countermeasures if countermeasure slaving is enabled.

'''Cons:'''

* Very large and heavy
* Alarmingly high fuel consumption
* Mediocre acceleration
* Suffers from a long takeoff roll, especially with maximum payload.
* Cannot sweep wings at all when outer two pylon stations are mounted (even after payload is jettisoned!), severely limiting maximum speed.
* Wings will not move to maximum sweep if bombs are present on the innermost pylons until bombs are dropped, limiting maximum speed and acceleration.
* Radar does not have IFF
* If countermeasures are slaved to MAW, they can quickly run out do to only having 52 countermeasures.
* AIM-9Bs are practicably useless

=== Devblog History ===
The prototype of a new American bomber was born from the conditions of a complex and constantly changing technical specification. The first flight of the F-111A prototype took place at the end of 1964 with serial production being established only 3 years later. While the initial priority for avionics development was the use of nuclear weapons, the Vietnam War dramatically changed the Aardvark's purpose towards a low-altitude bombing aircraft that could fly deep into enemy territory beyond the reach of anti-aircraft weaponry. The F-111 was in service with the U.S. Air Force until 1996 and was widely used in various military operations.
