Following the exposition of the shortcomings of the current fighter aircraft of the United States in the 1960s, particularly shown during the Vietnam War, the U.S. Department of Defense set out to procure a versatile, long-range strike aircraft to meet the demands of the Cold War for both the US Navy and Air Force. The F-111 project was born as a joint effort between the Air Force and Navy, aiming to create a multi-role aircraft capable of performing both strategic and tactical missions in USAF doctrine and for Navy "fleet defence and strike" doctrine, resulting in the F-111 development program being one of the most comical rollercoaster rides in the world of military aviation. After many shortcomings, failures, and cancellations of certain aspects of the program, primarily the F-111K (UK export variant) and F-111B (US Navy fleet defence fighter) being cancelled, the development shifted to solely focus on the USAF frontline-bomber variant. Though the F-111 program faced numerous challenges and controversies, it eventually evolved into an impressive aircraft known for its adaptability and innovative technology. The initial chapter in this story, the F-111A, was just the tip of the spear, and the advent of a long and notable history of the "Aardvark" family.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a heavy frontline bomber and low-altitude interdictor, introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. Building upon the doctrine and playstyle of previous aircraft in the bomber line, primarily the previous F-105D, the F-111A borrows many of its mission profiles, and as such has a similar set of advantages and disadvantages against its adversaries. The F-111 is characterized by being the extreme of most ends in-game, being the fastest aircraft in-game at the time of its introduction, at a Battle Rating where nothing can even dream of catching you at your max speed. However, reaching that max speed is another story, as the Pratt & Whitney TF-30 engines, familiar to pilots of the [[F-14A Early]], have abysmal acceleration, which when coupled with the high-drag airframe, means that the F-111A bleeds energy dangerously quickly in any manoeuvre. However, do not let these downsides deter you from the venerable 'Vark, as in the hands of a more experienced player, it can be a very dangerous fighter at its battle rating, utilizing its good top speed and great manoeuvrability at low speed to win almost all engagements it finds itself in. If all else fails, the F-111 can resort to bombing bases thanks to its highly respectable ordnance load, capable of leveling up to seven bases in Air Realistic Battles when fully loaded with bombs. In ground battles, the F-111 can function as a precision interdictor thanks to its small selection of precision weapons and bomb computer, or more likely, as an area-level frontline strike aircraft, thanks to its capability to carpet bomb with up to fifty bombs, or hammer a smaller area with its 456x FFAR rockets.

'''Players must take caution when taking any ordnance on the outermost four pylons, as this configuration locks the wings in forward sweep and turns the F-111 into a subsonic bomb truck.'''

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The General-Dynamics F-111A ''Aardvark'' is a superbly fast aircraft, however, it suffers from being powered by a pair of TF30s and weighing more than any other jet in the game, giving it the acceleration of a tortoise in winter. This is a plane that functions almost purely off its aerodynamics, which allows it to have one of the highest top speeds in the game at sea level and altitude (Mach 1.3 and 2.5 respectively). The F-111A is a fighter-bomber, and a large one, which means any air-to-air combat should leave dogfighting as a last resort. In the air-to-air role, it flies like an F-104 but even faster, however, you also have to deal with extremely poor energy retention due to the aircraft's large surface area. The Aardvark performs fairly well in rate fights against other large aircraft like the [[F-4 Phantom II (Family)|F-4]] and [[Su-17/22 (Family)|Su-17/22]], and the [[F-104 (Family)|F-104]] of course. In the air-to-ground role, the aircraft's performance varies widely. Using the inner-most pylons can result in a blockage of the wing sweep to 75%, however, they can swing back once the ordnance is dropped. Using the 2 outer pylons on each wing or gunpods renders the wings immobile and this significantly lowers top speed.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The greatest advantage for the F-111 Aardvark in terms of survivability is its raw speed. Although its acceleration is mediocre with any sort of payload, it has an extremely high top speed when moving in a straight line, and can outrun many aircraft without needing to ditch its bombs to do so as long as it was already moving fast.

The greatest disadvantage in terms of survivability for the F-111 is the sheer size of the aircraft and the fact that fuel and the engines takes up an extremely large portion of the internal aircraft volume. This means that any enemy fighters within gun range will not have a very hard time hitting something critical and starting a fire.

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely heavy payload capacity (currently, the heaviest payload capacity in-game)
* CCIP and CCRP bomb computer, CCIP rocket and cannon computer, radar has lead-computing cannon FCS
* Powerful Vulcan with 2,000 rounds
* MAW (Missile Approach Warning) can detect missiles approaching from the rear, and, optionally drop countermeasures if countermeasure slaving is enabled
* Surprisingly agile and manoeuvrable at low speeds with wings at 0% swing and combat flaps

'''Cons:'''

* Very large and heavy
* Alarmingly high fuel consumption
* Mediocre acceleration
* Suffers from a long takeoff roll, especially with maximum payload
* Cannot sweep wings at all when outer two pylon stations are mounted (even after payload is jettisoned!), severely limiting maximum speed.
* Wings will not move to maximum sweep if bombs are present on the innermost pylons until bombs are dropped, limiting maximum speed and acceleration
* Radar does not have IFF
* If countermeasures are slaved to MAW, they can quickly run out due to only having 52 countermeasures
* AIM-9Bs are practically useless

In 1961, the USAF and US Navy were both in the market for a new type of aircraft to fit their needs. With the appointment of Robert McNamara as Secretary of Defense in January 1961, he would become the jumping-off point when in June 1961 he approved what would become the TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) Program. McNamara would direct both branches to study the development of an aircraft to fit both needs, and although both branches wanted their respective needs separate from each other, they both shared the desire for a sole aircraft with not only the capability of carrying heavy fuel and weapons loads, but also featuring the ability to reach supersonic speeds with a two-seat crew accommodation and twin engine powerplant. As well as this, there also was the existence of a probability of the aircraft also featuring a variable-wing design being a factor. This would later become a point of contention for the Navy and would cause many issues in their search for an appropriate design. With much thought and consideration, the eventual plan of action would be a design for the USAF that could in turn be converted into use for the Navy. This would allow for not only a simple transition between the two, but also the cut-down in expenses that no doubt would come from having two unique designs available. The program would have submissions sent by aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell Aircraft, North American Aviation, and Republic Aviation which in the end would result in all submitting designs described as lacking. However, eventually Boeing and General Dynamics would be chosen to expand their respective designs and given the opportunity to begin the process of implementing the needed capabilities and changes to fit the guide lined requirements. In the end, even though the USAF was happy with Boeing's 818 design, the Navy found both manufacturers unable to meet their needs acceptably. This would matter little as even with the repeated recommendations to the boards, Robert McNamara would choose General Dynamics' proposal due to the much greater commonality between both variants.

At the end of the TFX Program in December 1961, General Dynamics signed the contract and began the development of what would become the F-111 Aardvark. Teaming up with Grumman to produce the rear fuselage and landing gear assemblies for the naval version due to their lack of experience, the early design work for the F-111 would be met by the strong objectives of an aircraft that would fall into the requirements for range, aircraft weight, and weapons loads. Although both aircraft featured many similarities in the powerplant and side-by-side crew seating in an ejection capsule, they also had many unique features as well. As the Navy had specific needs for their variant, the nose cone was shortened by 8.5ft to allow the aircraft to fit onto existing carrier-based deck elevators. Inside this shorter nose cone sat an AN/AWG-9 Pulse-Doppler radar combined with the addition of AIM-54 Phoenix Long-Range missiles. With the obvious lack of deck elevators on land, the USAF was able to keep the longer nose cone, fitting inside of it instead an AN/APQ-113 Attack Radar and APQ-110 Terrain-Following Radar with the ability to carry larger strike armaments. After a mockup example of the F-111 was observed in September 1963, the first working F-111A was rolled out of General Dynamics' Forth Worth, TX based facility a year later in October 1964. With the first flight of both the F-111A in December of that year and the F-111B coming later in May of the next year, problems began to become apparent as testing went on. Plagued by compressor stalls as well as stalling during specific points of flight, studies from NASA, the USAF, as well as General Dynamics would see the introduction of a new temporary engine-inlet design. However, this was not the end of redesigning and closer looks as during stress-testing it was revealed that cracks began forming on the wing-attach points. As this new defect was being attended to, the Navy would end their involvement in the F-111B due to many problems present with the aircraft in the form of weight and performance issues during the testing phase. This follows yet another blow to the program, as in 1969 the previously found cracks present in the wing attachment points would claim an aircraft during a flight.

Although the initial testing phase was marred with issues, the aircraft would finally get an introduction in 1967 when six aircraft were sent to Nellis AFB based fighter squadrons, with the 428th Tactical Fighter Squadron being brought up to operational capabilities in April of the next year. That same year, aircraft of 474th Tactical Fighter Wing were sent overseas to the war in Southeast Asia for testing in combat conditions. During this deployment, the aircraft flew 55 night-sorties with the loss of two aircraft. Even though replacement aircraft were being delivered from Nellis AFB, the loss of yet another Aardvark saw the halt of combat flying for the F-111 over Vietnam and a return to the US in November. While the loss of the first two aircraft is unknown, it is believed the third loss was a result of the loss of control from the sudden failure of a hydraulic control valve, causing the aircraft to pitch up with the inability of recovery. This prompted a further inspection into the remaining Aardvarks which revealed that 42 aircraft shared the same possibility of failure. With yet more failures identified, the full combat operational capacity of the F-111 in the 474th TFW did not arrive until 1971. In September 1972, the F-111 would make a return to Southeast Asia flying out of Takhli Air Base located in Thailand. Yet again sent from Nellis AFB, the F-111 would participate in the remainder of Operation Linebacker and later would also participate in over 150 low-level strike missions during Operation Linebacker II in December of that year. During their time in country, the North Vietnamese became fearful of the Aardvark, eventually giving it the nickname "Whispering Death" as a result. After making an impression during Linebacker II, the aircraft would as well take part against Communist forces, as seen with Operation Phoi Phiang III during the Laotian Civil War located in Laos. The aircraft became well-endeared due to its ability to fly fast and low in many weather conditions that would ground most others, making it highly effective during the remainder of combat in Southeast Asia. At the end of their tour in the region, over 4,000 combat missions had been flown by Aardvarks, with the loss of only six aircraft.

After their remarkable success in Vietnam, having continued to be stationed at Takhli Air Base until 1975, the aircraft would again be of use when in April 1986 18 F-111As would be joined by 25 Navy aircraft to conduct strikes against Libya in Operation El Dorado Canyon. This would prove again successful as with the loss of only one aircraft, thought to have been shot down over the Mediterranean Sea, it would once again show the versatility and heavy-hitting power that the F-111 was becoming known for. Beginning in 1990, F-111F and EF-111A Raven Electronic Warfare aircraft took part in Operation Desert Storm. Unsurprisingly, with a ratio of 3.2-to-1 success rate, strike variants would drop 80% of laser-guided weaponry over the course of the war and would in the end destroy over 1500 Iraqi armoured vehicles during the conflict. After decades of success in various roles and variants, the F-111 and EF-111 would finally be withdrawn from service in 1996 and 1998, respectively. During the retirement ceremony for the USAF, the F-111 would also officially obtain the name "Aardvark" which until then had been nothing more than a popular, unofficial nickname for the aircraft. However, this was not the end of their career, as even though the USAF had got their use out of the aircraft, Australia would continue to fly the F-111C until December 2010, over 35 years after their introduction in 1973 finally bringing the end of an aircraft first flown 46 years prior.

=== [[wt:en/news/8545-development-f-111a-aardvark-the-ultimate-bomber-en|Devblog]] ===
The prototype of a new American bomber was born from the conditions of a complex and constantly changing technical specification. The first flight of the F-111A prototype took place at the end of 1964 with serial production being established only 3 years later. While the initial priority for avionics development was the use of nuclear weapons, the Vietnam War dramatically changed the Aardvark's purpose towards a low-altitude bombing aircraft that could fly deep into enemy territory beyond the reach of anti-aircraft weaponry. The F-111 was in service with the U.S. Air Force until 1996 and was widely used in various military operations.
