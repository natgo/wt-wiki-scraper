== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Grumman F-14 Tomcat has been an icon of the USN since its introduction in 1970, but the US Navy wasn't the only user of the Tomcat. Though efforts were made to sell the Tomcat to US-allied countries, only Imperial Iran, then a close ally under the Pahlavi dynasty, sought a new interceptor to defend against the menacing, Mach 2.7-capable MiG-25R reconnaissance aircraft of the neighbouring Soviet Union. As soon as January 1974, after demonstration flights in the US alongside the F-15A, the IIAF placed an order for 80 Tomcats and ten years' worth of spare parts.

By the time of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which overthrew the 2,500-year-old monarchy of Iran and replaced it with the Islamic Republic, 79 F-14As had been delivered to the IIAF before the new IRIAF took them over. During the Iraq-Iran War, the Iranian Tomcats performed outstandingly against the Ba'athist Iraqi forces. However, due to sanctions placed on the now anti-US Islamic Republic, the IRIAF often had to improvise their existing weaponry to be outfitted on their aircraft, including modifying the MIM-23 Hawk SAM to be used as a substitute for the dwindling supply of AIM-54A Phoenix missiles, and even creating the "Yasser", a massive rocket created by strapping the M117 bomb warhead to spare rocket parts of the MIM-23 Hawk SAM to supplement the lack of guided munitions. With the eventual destruction of all remaining Tomcats stored in the continental US after the Gulf War to prevent possible smuggling of spare parts to Iran, the IRIAF had to cannibalise some of their remaining Tomcats to keep the jet operational. These F-14As also received some upgrades in terms of firepower with domestic modifications and sometimes Russian weaponry to keep them up-to-date. Fifty years since first delivered, the Iranian Tomcats are still in active service today under the designation "F-14AM" to denote various modernisation efforts to keep the aging fighter up-to-date.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced during [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/9005-event-get-the-iranian-f-14a-iriaf-in-the-persian-tomcat-event-en|2024 Persian Tomcat event]], is an F-14A operated by the IRIAF with domestic modifications to enhance its combat capabilities. The aircraft retains the advantages of the base model: powerful engines, advanced radar, and variable sweep wing, but this is supplemented by the Iranian Fakour-90 ARH missiles with longer range than the AIM-54A, Sedjil SARH missiles, and even the possibility of installing Soviet R-27R missiles. The massive Yasser rockets are also excellent for use against ground targets.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The F-14A (IRIAF) is a frail aircraft at best. Like most jets, it will struggle at taking hits from modern weaponry. Its large size also doesn't help as having a larger cross section makes one much more vulnerable to radar and much easier to hit. Most of its fuel tanks are not self-sealing, with only the centre tank being self-sealing. It is also very susceptible to IR missiles, largely due to its two Pratt & Whitney engines running extremely hot. Its low countermeasure count of only 60 and early RWR can handicap one from countering missiles fired at close ranges. It is a manoeuvrable plane though, and with enough skill, a pilot can prevent enemies from getting guns or missiles on them.

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent manoeuvrability in medium to high speed range
* Engines pack a lot of thrust
* Decent energy retention
* Sturdy airframe, can take some damage to the fuselage
* Variable sweep wings and automatic slats
* The M61 Vulcan cannon has an extremely fast fire rate, good velocity, and deals great damage
* Wide variety of weapons choice, both air to air and air to ground
* Long range radar with TWS HDN which allows to launch radar missiles without hard lock. 6 channel datalink enables to fire all Phoenixes one by one at different targets

'''Cons:'''

* Heavy
* Large target, massive wing and fuselage fuel tanks
* Afterburner gulps fuel like crazy
* No drop tank, all the fuel is carried internally hampering performance in dogfight
* Low countermeasure count considering the hot engines
* Can rip its wings in sustained high G turns
* RWR is subpar for the BR
