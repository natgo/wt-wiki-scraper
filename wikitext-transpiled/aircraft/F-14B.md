== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Ability to equip additional countermeasure pods grants a massive amount of countermeasures 
* Access to upgraded AIM-7M SARH missiles and AIM-54C ARH missiles 
* All-aspect AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles are a significant upgrade from the previous rear-aspect AIM-9H
* High velocity and extremely fast firing M61 rotary cannon
* Large air-to-air missile capacity of eight
* Substantial upgrade to thrust and climb rate from the previous F-14A
* Same powerful radar as the previous F-14A
* Strong air-to-ground load out with Paveway laser-guided bombs and the LANTIRN thermal laser targeting pod
* Excellent instantaneous and sustained turn rate
* Excellent energy retention
* Built-in camera targeting system automatically zooms in to radar locked aircraft and is useful for identification in simulator mode 
* Built-in camera  works with the  EEGS, it allows you to use the function by applying the target point on the enemy 

'''Cons:'''

* Large airframe makes for a large target
* Two very hot engines make it harder to flare off IR-guided missiles
* M61 rotary cannon has a rather small ammunition pool of 676
* The AIM-54C still only has 17G maximum overload and is thus rather easy to kinetically defeat

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== F-14B Upgrade Program ===	
During the mid-1980s, the United States Navy (USN) made a momentous decision to enhance the F-14 airframe by introducing a remarkable new variant of the aircraft. Originally designated as the F-14A+, this exceptional aircraft would eventually earn the prestigious moniker of the F-14B. The USN's comprehensive modernization program aimed to bring the F-14 airframe up to date with the latest technological advancements. One of the key aspects of this program was the incorporation of numerous electronic upgrades. The F-14B underwent a significant avionics overhaul, introducing advanced systems that improved the aircraft's capabilities in various areas. These upgrades included enhanced RWR systems, improved target detection and tracking capabilities (introduction of the Television Camera System) and upgraded communication systems to ensure seamless integration with other elements of the modern battlefield. In addition to these upgrades, the F-14B also received a major boost in terms of its powerplant. The outdated engines of the original F-14A model were replaced with the more advanced F110-GE-400 engines. These engines provided increased thrust and improved fuel efficiency, resulting in enhanced performance and greater operational flexibility for the aircraft. The F-110 engines also offered improved reliability and reduced maintenance requirements, which were crucial factors in ensuring the overall effectiveness and availability of the F-14B.

===[[wt:en/news/8228-development-grumman-f-14b-tomcat-the-bombcat-en|Devblog]]===
As part of the further upgrade of the Grumman F-14A carrier-based fighters, the aircraft were equipped with new General Electric F110-GE-400 turbojet engines with an afterburner, which significantly increased thrust, while reducing specific fuel consumption. The aircraft also received updated electronic equipment, as well as, unlike early production versions, the TISEO (Target Identification System, Electro Optical) optical target identification system. Initially, the updated Tomcats received the designation F-14A +.

This configuration was applied both to newly manufactured fighters, as well as to those already in service as an upgrade pack. In 1992, the designation was changed to F-14B in order to unify it with other military equipment in service. Subsequently, the F-14B were further upgraded in 1998 under the SLEP program. These jet fighters were in service with the US Navy aviation until 2006.
