== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Towards the end of the Vietnam War, the United States saw their major shortcoming in dogfighting performance, as the heavy [[F-4 Phantom II (Family)|F-4 Phantom]] operated by most branches at the time was garnering an unsatisfactory kill-death ratio. Meanwhile, the far more manoeuvrable "gunfighter" [[F-8E|F-8 Crusader II]] was achieving a far better track record. As a result, not long after the end of the conflict, two new development projects were started by the USAF, one of which was the F-X program to develop a "next generation" fighter that favoured manoeuvrability over top speed. However, the F-X program would take a sharp turn not long after, as multiple radar reports from Turkey and Israel observed an unknown Soviet aircraft flying overhead at speeds above Mach 3. Quick investigation through spy satellites and high altitude reconnaissance aircraft brought the discovery of the Soviet's latest MiG-25 aircraft, which at the time was assumed by the West as a high tech, next generation fighter made of the latest composite materials. What scared the United States the most, was that the design of this MiG-25 was dangerously similar to the initial prototypes of the F-X program, which had not even flown yet. Eventually, development of the F-X program was accelerated into its latter phases, resulting in the venerable F-15 Eagle, an absolute best of all worlds, no compromises held, air superiority fighter to combat this new Soviet threat. However, the defection of Viktor Belenko to Japan with his MiG-25 shortly after showed the world that the MiG-25 was overestimated, being in reality constructed out of heavy metals and armed with weaker avionics suited for long range combat, making the MiG-25 merely a heavy interceptor, and not the "next generation super-fighter" that was feared before. The same cannot be said about the indomitable Eagle however, as the F-15 and its later variants would go on to establish the most widely regarded air-to-air combat kill-death ratio of any modern jet fighter: '''at least 103 aircraft kills without a single confirmed loss.'''

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' succeeds the equally famous [[F-4E Phantom II]] in the tech tree. The F-15A is represented as the 1994 model in service with the US Air National Guard, being outfitted with 240 countermeasures and the upgraded AN/APG-63 PSP radar, but lacking [[AIM-120A]] and BOL rails. Even without such upgrades, the Eagle is still a very fearsome monster in top tier jet battles, utilizing its great avionics and incredible missile selection, including the lethal [[AIM-9M Sidewinder|AIM-9M]] with IRCCM flare-rejection, to prey on enemy aircraft at a safe distance. More importantly, unlike the earlier Phantoms, when push comes to shove, the Eagle can reliably dogfight most enemies it may face thanks to its stable airframe design and absurd engine power giving it incredible acceleration and TWR. One must still be wary however that the Eagle is not completely undefeatable, and proper usage of this aircraft requires training and discipline just like its real life counterpart. Some enemies to be aware of are the [[Mirage 4000]] and early [[F-16A]]s for their ability to win an extended dogfight over the Eagle, but moreso cautious when engaging players flying the [[JAS39A|JAS 39]], [[J-11]], and [[Su-27]], as these aircraft not only possess an unstable airframe allowing them to perform impressive manoeuvres (and defeat the Eagle) at low speeds, but they also carry lethal close range missiles with IRCCM, which when coupled with their helmet-mounted targeting systems, can prove to be very dangerous for any enemy, Eagle or not, which gets close and slow in a dogfight.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Eagle on full fuel can be a very sluggish fighter, and this is especially noticeable with a full weapons load. On low fuel however, the F-15A is no slouch and can easily contend with anything in its BR range. The high speed pull is quite good for a jet of its size, and it can sustain up to 20 degrees per second at lower speeds (450 km/h). At speeds above Mach 1, the jet can sustain up to 13G, and won't experience wing overload until 15-16G. The Eagle is best described as rocket-like, as its high thrust-to-weight ratio give it an excellent climb rate, and allows it to stay in prolonged dogfights. In terms of speed, the aircraft reaches its top speed fairly quickly, but is slower than contemporaries like the F-16C or Mirage 2000 at lower altitudes.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Even though the aircraft possesses no armour, the Eagle is very durable, even tanking missiles at times, and can continue to fly in a severely crippled state. Minor structural damage is in some cases negligible to stability or performance. This doesn't mean you should brush off damage however, and like several other jets in this BR range, the F-15A can easily destabilize if missing even a wing tip. If badly hurt, you should almost never stay aggressive and attempt to repair at your nearby airfield.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Air Realistic Battles'''

The F-15A is very capable as a frontline fighter, and has a large number of countermeasures at its disposal in case of any threats. The AIM-9M is likely going to be your primary armament, as the AIM-7M is limited in use. The combination of a very capable platform and IRCCM make the Eagle a deadly fighter. However, you should avoid engaging a group of enemies, as this is where the jet struggles. Even though it retains speed very well, it can easily slow down when backed into a corner. As always, stay with your team and don't head into furballs blindly. Avoid drawn-out dogfights as this can easily lead to a third-party situation, and the off-boresight capability of enemies like the Su-27, JAS-39, J-11, and later MiG-29 variants can best the Eagle even if in the disadvantageous position. The F-14 Tomcat can also be a formidable opponent in BVR combat due to its long-range Phoenix air-to-air missiles that utilizes active-radar homing. The F-15A is no slouch, however, as it can hold its own in a BVR fight. Be sure to pay attention to your RWR and defend accordingly.

'''Air Simulator Battles'''

In simulator battles, the F-15 is very formidable due to its smokeless AIM-9M air-to-air missiles, but is limited by the seeker range and speed of the AIM-7M. The cockpit allows for excellent visibility and provides great situational awareness to the pilot, but the jet does lack HMD, so you must point your nose at targets. The biggest advantage the F-15A has in a simulator battle is its high speed manoeuvrability and smokeless missiles, allowing for stealthy kills.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Quite manoeuvrable at all speeds
* Incredible engine output at all altitudes
* High TWR and amazing acceleration
* Lethal AIM-9M missiles with IRCCM capabilities

'''Cons:'''

* Large and easy-to-hit target
* No TWS mode hinders BVR capabilities
* Sparrows are inconsistent and unreliable
* Tends to bleed airspeed very rapidly in high-G turns
