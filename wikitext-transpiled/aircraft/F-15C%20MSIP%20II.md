== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a further development of the F-15A, the F-15C being almost impossible to visually distinguish from its earlier predecessor. It was originally intended as a small upgrade to the F-15A, but would go on to be much more. Coming only a few years later, in its initial fit the only major difference was extra fuel, with the same engines, radar, and still no countermeasures. The Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP) II refit in the mid-1980s aimed to rectify that. The F-15C gained access to the AN/APG-63 PSP radar, flares, new engines optimised for high speeds, and the ability to carry conformal fuel tanks to further extend range - all part of MSIP.

Soldiering on through the late '80s and '90s, the F-15C would gain access to the [[AIM-9M Sidewinder|AIM-9M]] and [[AIM-120A|AMRAAM]] before receiving two new radars in the early 2000s: the {{Annotation|AESA|Active Electronically Scanned Array}} AN/APG-63 (v)2 in late 2000, and the worse AN/APG-63 (v)1 in early 2001. The introduction of the AIM-9X and {{Annotation|JHMCS|Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System}} in the early to mid-2000s led to more and more advanced variants of missiles and radars. The F-15C is still in service today, though it is finally in the process of being phased out by the F-15EX after almost five decades of service.

Introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]], the F-15C MSIP II in its mid-2000s variant serves as arguably one of the strongest air supremacy fighters in War Thunder. While its flight performance is marginally worse than the preceding [[F-15A]], the F-15C stands out with its large complement of air-to-air missiles, notably sharing the crown for most {{Annotation|ARH|Active Radar-Homing}} missiles at 8 with the [[F-15J(M)]] of the Japanese tree. {{Annotation|HMD|Helmet-Mounted Display}} integration also provides the ability to slave both heat-seeking missiles and radar, which is a very useful capability in the fast-paced battles of 4th generation aircraft. The only real downside is the lacking CAS ability with only dumb bombs and 3 TV-guided bombs compared to many of the other fighters of this rank, as the F-15C wasn't intended as a multirole aircraft; that role was filled by the later F-15E Strike Eagle.
