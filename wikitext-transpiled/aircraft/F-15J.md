== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a variant of the American [[F-15A|F-15 ''Eagle'']] customized for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and produced under a licensing agreement with the United States, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries taking the lead in manufacturing. The F-15J, which entered service in the early 1980s, was designed to replace Japan's ageing fleet of [[F-104J|F-104J ''Eiko'']]s and [[F-4EJ|F-4EJ ''Phantom'']]s. This twin-engine, all-weather air superiority fighter featured advanced radar and avionics for long-range engagement. The aircraft's design emphasized air-to-air combat capabilities, featuring a mix of short and medium-range missiles, the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow respectively, on top of the domestic [[AAM-3]] missile.

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], the F-15J is the crown jewel of the Japanese air tree. This translates to a very fast dedicated air superiority fighter, that is surprisingly nimble for such a heavy machine. It remains a very capable jet even when compared to its competition like the [[Su-27]] and the [[JAS39A|JAS39 Gripen]]. It is also the only plane featuring the AAM-3 domestic Japanese missile in-game.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The F-15J is a heavy aircraft, but quite nimble for its size. It can pull surprisingly well for its weight and size. Caution should be taken between Mach 1.0 and 1.1, as a combination of elevator, rudder, and aileron deflection will easily rip the wings. It pulls very hard around 800 km/h IAS.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The F-15 was designed with a focus on survivability. It can often survive non-direct missile hits and still be operational enough to land, compared to an [[F-16 (Family)|F-16]] or a [[Mirage 2000 (Family)|Mirage 2000]] which cannot fly well with damaged wings. The F-15 has no armour protection, but the high capacity of countermeasures (240) helps with decoying incoming missiles.

The F-15J has very basic armament loadouts. It gets access to some of the best IR missiles in-game, the AAM-3, which performs like an improved version of the famous [[AIM-9M]]. In terms of SARH missiles, the [[AIM-7M Sparrow|AIM-7M]] are the only possible missiles.

In terms of air-to-ground ordnance, the F-15J has three hardpoints that can carry up to 3 x 2,000 lb bombs, up to 18 x 500 lb bombs, or up to 9 x BLU-27/B incendiary bombs.

The F-15J also has access to up to three drop tanks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The F-15J is a top-tier aircraft that can punch above its weight. It is a big and heavy aircraft, with all of the features a competitive top-tier jet needs for air-to-air combat. It gets access to eight air-to-air missiles in total, a good amount of flares, and a good flight model.

One might think the F-15J would be bad at dogfighting, however, due to its design it can fight surprisingly well for such a big plane. It can have a hard time against planes that can pull a lot of AOA (Angle of Attack) like the [[Su-27]], or the [[JAS39A|JAS 39]], however, due to the powerful engines of the F-15J, such enemies will have a hard time keeping up with the Eagle in the long run.

The F-15's flight model can be compared to a combination of an F-4 and an F-16. It is a brick, like the F-4, however it turns extremely well under the right circumstances, like an F-16.

* The F-15J does not have a lot of playstyles due to its limitations. It should be used as a "Boom-And-Zoom" plane. the F-15J should never be inside the "furball" that forms in the first minutes of the match, however, the pilot of the F-15 should be ready at any moment after the formation of the "furball" be ready to speed towards it to launch some AAM-3 and maybe AIM-7M missiles. After passing through the furball and dodging incoming missiles, the pilot should keep their energy up, and go back again to try and destroy some more targets. It is also possible to grab 12 x 500 lbs bombs to destroy one base for some extra RP and SL, and then proceed to fight the enemy planes. Generally, 40 minutes of total fuel is enough for a match of Air Realistic battles. Each drop tank has around 11 minutes of fuel.
* The F-15J can be a good interceptor in Ground Realistic battles, however, it is outclassed by the [[F-16AJ]] due to its access to [[AGM-65B]].

The F-15J is quite a specialized aircraft, tailor-made for the air superiority role due to its armament. It is a competitive jet that has its quirks and few compromises, but it is very scary in the hands of a good pilot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very high thrust-to-weight ratio, allowing very high acceleration, rapid climbing and dogfight endurance
* High amount of countermeasures (240) allowing it to decoy missiles reliably
* AAM-3 missiles, akin to an improved AIM-9M with better turning capability and better range
* High amount of fuel, providing ~18 minutes of afterburning time
* Multiple high capacity drop tanks, so is possible to have large amount of fuel for afterburner while keeping fuel on board low for better manoeuvrability after dropping the tanks if needed.
* Good manoeuvrability for such a big and heavy jet fighter
* High ammo capacity for cannon

'''Cons:'''

* Heavyweight
* The cannon is placed quite far away to the right, which makes aiming tricky
* No HMD for radar or missiles
* No TWS mode for radar
* No guided air-to-ground armament
* Tends to compress at speeds above Mach 1
* Large size makes it easier to hit for cannon

The '''F-15J ''Eagle''''', a cornerstone of Japan's air defence, represents a pivotal chapter in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force's (JASDF) history. This twin-engine, all-weather air superiority fighter, a variant of the American McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, emerged from Japan's strategic need to modernize its air capabilities in the 1970s. During this period, Japan was in the process of phasing out its ageing fleet of [[F-104J]] Starfighters and [[F-4EJ Phantom II]]s. After a thorough evaluation of various options, including the [[F-14 (Family)|F-14 ''Tomcat'']] and [[F-16 (Family)|F-16 ''Fighting Falcon'']], the JASDF settled on the F-15 Eagle, primarily for its unmatched air superiority.

The journey of the F-15J began with a landmark agreement in 1978 between Japan and the United States, allowing Japan to produce the fighter under license. This decision was more than a mere procurement choice; it was a strategic manoeuvre aimed at bolstering Japan's domestic aerospace industry. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was entrusted with the manufacturing, marking a significant step in Japan's post-war industrial and defence capabilities. The initial batch of F-15Js was assembled in the United States and then shipped to Japan for final assembly, but subsequent units were wholly constructed in Japan, showcasing the country's growing technical prowess.

The F-15J was tailored to meet specific Japanese requirements. It incorporated indigenous electronic warfare systems, radar, and other avionics, distinguishing it from its American counterpart. However, in line with Japan's defence-oriented policy, certain features like in-flight refuelling were initially left out.

Inducted into service in 1982, the F-15J swiftly became the backbone of Japan's air superiority. Over the years, it underwent several upgrades, enhancing its radar, avionics, and weapon systems to keep pace with global technological advancements. The F-15J's role extended beyond mere hardware; it was integral in joint training exercises with the United States and other allies, honing the JASDF's tactical capabilities and ensuring interoperability.

A key aspect of the F-15J's operational history is its role in air defence. Tasked with safeguarding Japan's airspace, it has been routinely scrambled to intercept foreign military aircraft, particularly Russian and Chinese, near Japanese territory. However, in alignment with Japan's post-World War II pacifist constitution, the F-15J has not been engaged in active combat. Its use has been strictly limited to defensive and deterrence missions.

Looking to the future, Japan has initiated an ambitious modernization program for its F-15J fleet. This program aims to equip the fighters with advanced electronics, radar systems, and the ability to carry more sophisticated weaponry. Yet, as the defence landscape evolves, discussions about the F-15J's role in Japan's future air defence strategy continue, with potential transitions to newer platforms like the F-35 Lightning II being considered.
