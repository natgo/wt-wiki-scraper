== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

A representation of rented [[F-16A ADF]]s from the USAF for the Italian Air Force; aside from the roundel on the aircraft, the jet performs exactly like its American counterpart, ensuring the air-combat capability of Italy with some of the most advanced missiles in game, as well as advanced avionics and manoeuvrability.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- High power-to-weight ratio gives it an incredible acceleration
- Highly manoeuvrable at lower speeds
- Able to carry a drop tank to extend flight time
- Access to 6 x AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles

'''Cons:'''

- Consumes fuel quickly
- G limit
- No air-to-ground armament

The history of the F-16 ADF began during the mid 1980s, America had phased out their USAF Air Defense Command which meant the duty to protect the American skies would completely fall to the Air National Guard. Their main task was to intercept bombers from the Soviet Union during a theoretical invasion. This meant that they would need an agile aircraft which would not only be fast enough to intercept the high altitude bombers, but also be properly equipped to shoot enemy aircraft down. General Dynamics initially would convert up to 270 F-16A/F-16B airframes into ADF standard. The modification would retain the ability to mount air-to-ground missiles, rockets and bombs however it introduced the AN/APG-66 radar which greatly improved target acquisition of small targets, IFF for distinguishing friendlies and foes (AN/APX-109), and a 150,000-candlepower night spotlight for identification. The ADF would be in service for many years, but ultimately due to the Cold War dying down after the dissolution of the USSR, the need for all the surplus F-16s would dwindle down. Some of the ADFs would be converted back into regular F-16As or Bs, whilst others were either put in storage or exported to other nations.

In Italy's case, during the end of the Cold War the F-104s were still Italy's primary defence against enemy bombers and fighter jets, and although it did have some upsides as it was still extremely fast meaning it could react to threats quicker, it was not fit for dogfighting. Italy joined in the Eurofighter program, which also included Spain, Germany and the UK, this would allow them to have a common modern multi-role fighter that would go into service and remain in service for decades to come. The issue however was development of this new fighter required time and money, something which after the Soviet Union collapsed was not readily available, especially due to all western/NATO countries deciding to downsize their armed forces. Italy would be put in a very tough situation, the F-104s were still in service but they could not risk them being shot down in case they were forced to enter a dogfight.

As a stop-gap measure, Italy would initially order several Tornadoes from the UK in the ADV (F.3) variant which would be able to give Italy a decent fighter which was capable of dogfighting. They weren't bought, but instead rented to the Italian Air Force from stocks belonging to the RAF in 1993 with a decade-long contract, since Italy also operated quantities of the [[Tornado IDS (1995) (Italy)|IDS]] variant. They did their job but the joint-developed Eurofighter program had other setbacks once again which meant that Italy had to make a choice, either extend the rental of the ADV fighters or choose another stop-gap option. The ADV would become too expensive to rent again so they were returned, Italy would study its choices but ended up preferring the American F-16, especially in its ADF variant. Thus in 2001, an agreement was signed with the United States on 15th March to provide the Italian Air Force with 30 F-16A ADFs, 1 F-16B ADF, and 3 F-16B block 5 and 10 in OCU configuration.

Before delivery to the Italian Air Force, the aircraft would be brought out of storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona and transferred to the Ogden ALC at Hill AFB, Utah, where they would undergo 220 days of refurbishment and upgrades. Part of the upgrades included the Falcon-Up and several changes to the aircraft such as replacement of particular bulkheads, updating the landing gear and anything which extended its life, as the ones which were put in storage already had several hundred hours of flight time. Once refurbishment was completed in the US, the F-16s would be delivered to the Italian Air Force as part of the "Peace Caesar" program.<ref>https://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article10.html</ref> It's good to note that whilst the F-16s were being ready, several pilots from the Italian Air Force would be sent to America to be trained on the aircraft, which also included armament familiarization.

Italian F-16s in service would not be equipped with rockets, bombs or air to ground munitions, however they did still retain the ability to do so. Italian F-16 armament consisted of AIM-120, AIM-9L, and also AIM-9E and M anti-air missiles. The 20 mm Vulcan was also kept. Italian F-16s would be a main component of the Italian Air Force. One of their first deployments would be in Libyan airspace, as part of NATO's Operation Unified Protector which established a no-fly zone over Libya. They'd also be used as escorts for Italian SEAD packages. As the first decade went by relatively peacefully and the eventual commission of Eurofighters for Italy, Italian F-16s belonging to the 5° Stormo would be retired at Cervia air base in 2010 with each F-16 being painted in a special colour. On the 23rd of May 2012, a disbanding ceremony would held at Trapani-Birgi air force base to mark the disbandment of the 18° Gruppo, which at that point was the sole surviving F-16 squadron within the Italian Air Force. Not all Italian F-16s were returned to America, some were stored in Italy whilst some made their way to museums; for example, at the Vigna di Valle museum, there is an F-16 which belonged to 23° Gruppo of the 5° Stormo, MM7251.
