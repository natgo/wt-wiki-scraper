<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

By the end of the 1970s, Israel had established itself as the dominant air force in the Levant, having achieved technological superiority over the Soviet-equipped Syrian army - the only adjacent threat remaining after the signing of the peace deal with Egypt. This was mainly thanks to the purchase of F-15s into the Israeli Air Force (IAF) in 1976, which provided both a defensive and offensive umbrella that could not be challenged effectively by the Syrians. Nevertheless, the IAF still had two critical issues with the F-15: its prohibitive cost, and its relative unsuitability for low-altitude bombing, interdiction, and dogfighting. As the pressure mounted to replace the ageing [[F-4E_Phantom_II_(Israel)|F-4E Phantom II]], [[Nesher]] and [[Kfir C.7]], the IAF finally decided to purchase General Dynamics's new F-16 multi-role jet.

Israel received its first four F-16s on July 2nd, 1980 - a mix of F-16A and F-16B fighters (single-seat and two-seat, respectively) - with a total of 75 arriving by the end of 1981. These planes, mostly F-16As from production Block 10, were originally sold to Iran's Shah regime, a US ally since the 1950s; however in 1979 the Islamic Revolution deposed the Shah, marking a significant change in the balance of power in the region and solidifying Israel's status as one of the only remaining trustworthy US allies in the Middle East. Since the planes could no longer be delivered to Iran, they were instead sold to Israel.

The IAF named the model "Netz" (Hawk), making no distinction between the F-16A and B. Due to its amazing capabilities as a low-altitude fighter-bomber, the Netz effectively replaced all other IAF combat jets except for the F-15. By the late 1980s, the F-15 and F-16 together comprised nearly the entirety of the IAF's active combat jet force.

On April 28th, 1981, less than a year after its introduction into the IAF, Netz #126 codenamed "Magen" (Shield) made the world's first aerial kill by an F-16 when it shot down a Syrian Mi-8 over the Bekaa Valley in Syria. Only a few months after that, on June 7th, 1981, eight Netz F-16A/Bs comprised the attacking element in Operation Opera - the Israeli surprise attack on the Osirak nuclear facility near Baghdad, Iraq - in which the reactor was completely destroyed. All attacking fighters returned to base unharmed. The fact that Israel had concealed its preparations from the United States caused President Reagan to withhold the transfer of the final two dozen F-16s to Israel, but this decision was rescinded after only a short while.

One year later, on June 6th, 1982, Israel began "Operation Peace for the Galilee", later known as the First Lebanon War. A few days into the war, on June 9th through June 11th, Israel conducted "Operation Mole Cricket 19", a massive SEAD campaign that obliterated the entire Syrian air defense network along the Syrian border with Lebanon. Dozens of Netz F-16s participated in this attack as interceptors, fighting alongside F-15s to shoot down any Syrian jets scrambled against the wild weasels. By the end of the second day of this operation, Israel's Netz F-16s alone had shot down a total of 44 Syrian [[MiG-21 (Family)|MiG-21]]s, [[MiG-23 (Family)|MiG-23]]s and [[Su-17/22 (Family)|Su-22s]] - more than half the total number of enemy jets shot down during the battle - while suffering no losses in the process. This massive, one-sided air battle has become known as the "Bekaa Valley Turkey Shoot".

One Netz in particular - Netz #107 codenamed "Sufa" (Storm) - distinguished itself in world history by becoming the jet with the highest number of aerial kills to this day. This F-16A was the second to bomb the Osirak reactor in 1981, and later shot down a total of 6 enemy aircraft (plus one "kill assist"), most of them during the Bekaa Valley Turkey Shoot. Four of these kills were scored by Col. Eytan Stibbe during a single sortie on June 11th - the only F-16 pilot in the world to ever achieve this feat. Stibbe later became Israel's second-ever astronaut - the first Israeli to visit the International Space Station. Today, Netz #107 is on display at the Israeli Air Force Museum. Israel's advanced F-16I model line is named Sufa in honour of this plane.

Israel did at one point attempt to produce its own 4th-generation multi-role fighter to replace the F-16: the IAI Lavi. However pressure from the United States forced the project to be scuttled before production could begin. In compensation for torpedoing the project, the US agreed to provide Israel with 75 F-16C/Ds (codenamed "Barak" in Israel), which were delivered in 1987. Nevertheless, F-16A/Bs remained in IAF service for many years afterwards. In 1994, the United States compensated Israel for staying out of the First Iraq War by supplying it with another 50 surplus F-16A/Bs, most of them from the US National Guard and Air Force Reserves. Most F-16A/Bs in the IAF were eventually upgraded to F-16C/D standards. All Netz F-16A/Bs were retired from IAF service by around 2015.
