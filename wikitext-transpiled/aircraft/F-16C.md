== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a major improvement over the previous variants of the F-16. The previous Block 42 aircraft weighed 3,000+ lbs (1,360 kgs) over the early F-16s. To offset the increased weight, General Electric developed the F110-GE-129 which greatly increased thrust at both low and high altitudes. The Block 50 also received the Westinghouse APG-68 radar which was much faster and generally more reliable. One of the biggest additions to the Block 50 was the ability to fire AIM-120 AMRAAMs and new ground attack munitions. It could also utilize the AGM-88 HARM which was a dedicated SEAD weapon. The USAF received the first F-16 Block 50 in late 1991 and many more were sent to foreign countries as well.

Introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is an excellent top-tier aircraft. The improved General Electric F110 greatly increases the performance of the Block 50 against enemy aircraft. It excels in dogfighting thanks to its relatively light airframe and better engine. The Fighting Falcon has access to AIM-9M Sidewinders which have a smokeless motor as well as improved IRCCM which makes them an incredibly dangerous missile, especially from rear aspect. Players should be more than satisfied with the F-16C Block 50 against both aircraft and ground targets.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''F-16C Playstyle'''

The F-16C is a purebred squad fighter, performing most efficiently with allied help. A group of 3-4 F-16s is a deadly force to be reckoned with, no matter the enemy. To get the most out of the Block-50, focus on assisting allies and cleaning up baited targets. The F-16 can be a menace by dipping in and out of fights, utilizing its effective HMD to sling AIM-9Ms at slow and distracted opponents. However, due to poor high speed maneuverability, the F-16 should never be found alone, by multiple enemies, especially. Poor high-speed agility can reduce responsiveness times for pilots, giving  pursuing enemies crucial space for positioning. The F-16 can be easily overwhelmed when outnumbered, so the best way to combat the weakness is to avoid it altogether. By using careful target prioritization, a Block-50 can kill enemies and free up allies for assistance at the same time. Through practice, you will learn your plane by heart, finally unleashing the full potential of this vicious aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to potent AIM-9M missiles with the option of a smokeless motor
* Access to a LITENING II TGP in contrast to other F-16 variants
* Large variety of guided ground ordnance
* Better radar than previous F-16s
* Has TWS (Track While Scan)
* Upgraded F110-GE-129 engine with significantly more thrust
* Advanced AN/ALR-56M RWR that can detect a variety of threats
* Access to a voice warning system (Betty)
* Access to a helmet-mounted display (JHMCS)

'''Cons:'''

* Bad top speed manoeuvrability
* High fuel consumption
* Internal M61 cannon still has a limited ammo supply
* Worse flight performance than previous F-16s

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Block 42 F-16 was very overweight at an astounding 3,000 lb increase over the F-16A/Bs. This was also compounded by the fact that the Block 42 was intended to carry more ordnance and didn't have any significant thrust increase. As a result, the USAF launched the Increased Performance Engine (IPE) program to increase the thrust of the F-16. The Pratt & Whitney F100 and General Electric F110 engines were both redesigned and were much more powerful compared to their predecessors. The F110, found in the Block 50, featured a thirty-percent increase in thrust at low altitudes and a ten-percent increase at higher altitudes. The Block 50 also received the Westinghouse APG-68 radar which had increased reliability and was much faster. The displays in the cockpit were also replaced and an FOV HUD was added. The Block 50 also has access to a multitude of ordnance, and thanks to the improved engine, it can also carry much more. The Block 50 can use the AGM-88 HARM, AIM-120 AMRAAM, new surface target weaponry, SAPHEI rounds (PGU-28), and bombs.
[[File:F-16c thunderbirds 2022.JPG|thumb|F-16Cs of the USAF Thunderbirds performing a Diamond Formation, October 2022.]]
The USAF began receiving the Block 50s in the early 90s and continued receiving them until 2005. After that, F-16 deliveries were exclusively for foreign customers where the F-16 also shined. Further upgrades were done on the Block 50 such as the Block 50 Plus which included more advanced electronics: the radar was improved, a better IFF system was installed, and it could be modified to have conformal fuel tanks (CFT).

In 2001, F-16C and F-16D Block 40/42 and Block 50/52 underwent an upgrade program called CCIP or Common Configuration Implementation Program. Block 50 F-16Cs modernized under this program were identified by the "bird slicer" antennas on the AN/APX-113 IFF interrogators. The CCIP program integrated newer targeting pods such as the Lockheed Martin Sniper XR targeting pod (Phase IB) and the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (Phase II).
