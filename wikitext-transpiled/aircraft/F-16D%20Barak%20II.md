== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the late 1970s, Israel was designing a new jet fighter with ideas borrowed from previous aircraft they utilized. It ultimately culminated in the IAI Lavi, a fierce competitor to the F-16 Fighting Falcon in the export market. Unfortunately for Israel, the project increased in cost and was canceled for budgetary reasons. The US also had a part in the demise of the Lavi as they viewed the Lavi as a threat to the F-16's export capability. As compensation, the US sent 24 F-16Ds and around 50 F-16Cs in 1987. A year later, under the Peace Marble III program, Israel ordered 30 F-16Cs and 30 F-16Ds. The F-16Ds received extensive modifications like refinished Multi-Function Displays and Heads-Up Displays.

Introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is one of the most advanced F-16s in-game. For ground striking it can utilize the LANTIRN pod, making it an effective all-weather platform. It also has a variety of bombs to use including dumb bombs and smart bombs like the GBU-16. For air combat, the Barak II also has a variety of ordnance to use. The Barak II has access to the AIM-9M Sidewinder, an extremely capable infrared missile that boasts a unique IRCCM system and a smokeless motor. It can also carry AIM-7M Sparrows for long-range engagements. The F-16D Block 40 Barak II is a very versatile aircraft for both ground striking and air combat.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The General Electric engine provides a very good TWR, and the Barak II is able to accelerate quite fast. The turning rate is good, but the airframe performance is inferior to the F-16A airframes since the Barak II has an increased weight. Additionally, carrying an air-to-ground payload will severely impact your flight performance. The turning rate is sufficient for most encounters.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Similar to other top-tier aircraft, the Barak II doesn't have any significant armor. The airframe can take some hits from 20mm/30mm, but a good burst will easily rip control surfaces apart, destroy the engine, and knock out pilots. A direct hit from any missile will most likely destroy the plane entirely.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M61A1 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm M61A1 cannon, wing root-mounted (512 rpg)
* 180 x countermeasures

The 20 mm Vulcan is an excellent weapon for air-to-air combat as it has favorable projectile velocity and is very easy to aim. However, the gun has a short spool up time so players must take this into account when preparing for a short burst. Plenty of countermeasures allow for longer time in battle and players also can be less concerned about running out of flares/chaff.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The F-16D Barak II provides a good platform for either committing to attacking other planes, destroying ground targets in GRB with the diverse payload options, or a mixture of both. A large amount of flares/chaff helps prolong the time the Barak II can spend in battle. Players must however keep in mind that the engine burns fuel very quickly when left on afterburner.

Like all other top-tier jets, maintaining situational awareness and knowing when to engage/disengage enemies is critical to survival. Especially in GRB, keep an eye out for enemy SPAA and be ready to take evasive maneuvers when your RWR is pinged or if you spot a missile.

When bringing the Barak II to GRB, the player can choose to either use conventional bombs or the "smart" GBU guided bombs. The four 2000lbs are very useful for taking out enemy tanks quickly when rushing, but the player again must be beware of ground SPAA and anti-air fire since the Barak II lacks armor. After bombs are expended, players can use their anti-air missiles against enemy planes if they choose to do so.

In ARB, the Barak II is best suited to plane-to-plane combat as it will benefit the team the most, and the Barak II's flight performance is significantly reduced when carrying bombs of any kind. It is better to not commit to close-range fights as you can easily be killed by other enemies while you are focused on eliminating someone, however the 20mm Vulcan makes downing planes quite easy if you need it. Make sure to utilize your AIM-9Ms as they are very effective at taking out enemy planes.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Access to the deadly AIM-9M missiles
* Excellent loadout variety for ground attack and Air to Air combat
* Good flight performance and maneuverability in most situations
* Large number of countermeasures for prolonged combat, allows for some leniency in countermeasure use
* Engine provides a very good TWR (thrust to weight ratio)

'''Cons:'''

* Inferior flight performance to the normal F-16A airframe due to additional weight
* Carrying bombs or external ground-strike payload negatively impacts flight performance
* Engine consumes fuel very quickly when on WEP/afterburner
* No armor of any kind, extremely vulnerable to ground and air munitions of any kind
* Large engine gives off a significant heat signature for IR missiles, even when afterburner is off
* Tier III and Tier IV modifications take some time to research for non-premium players

In the late 1970s, Israel began its ambitious project to produce its first locally-manufactured jet fighter, meant to replace the aging [[Kfir C.7|IAI Kfir]]. Learning from their previous work on the [[Mirage 5 (Family)|Mirage]] and Kfir programs, and borrowing ideas from America's then-new [[F-16A]] fighter jet (which had entered IAF service in 1980 as the "[[Netz]]"), Israeli aeronautic engineers were able to develop a highly-manoeuvrable, delta-wing, single-seat fighter of their own - the IAI Lavi.

After nearly a decade of development the Lavi's first prototype was flown in 1986, and reportedly proved extremely capable. The United States, which had up to that point supported and partially funded the Lavi project, was dismayed to learn that the new aircraft might be good enough to provide a much cheaper competitor for the F-16 on the export market. The Reagan administration soon began pressuring the Israeli government to cancel the project. Though Israel's defense minister Moshe Arens was strongly behind the Lavi, the project's ever-increasing pricetag made it easy for the rest of the Israeli government to agree to US demands. The Lavi project was finally canceled in late 1987.

As compensation for torpedoing Israel's fighter manufacture ambitions, the United States agreed to sell Israel additional F-16Cs and Ds. A significant number of them, all from the Block 30 model, had already been sold to Israel by that point, entering IAF service under the codename ''"Barak"'' (Lightning) in late 1987. In 1988, the US and Israel signed that new "compensation" deal - named "Peace Marble III" - delivering a total of 60 F-16s, all from Block 40, between 1991 and 1993. Half were F-16Cs and half were F-16Ds (single-seat and double-seat, respectively). In the IAF, these new Block 40 aircraft were named ''"Barak II"'' (Lightning II), correspondingly amending the name of the older Block 30 aircraft to ''"Barak I"'' (note: the IAF does not keep separate names for single- and double-seat variants of the F-16).

The F-16C/D has several advantages over the F-16A/B, but the most important is the ability to mount a LANTIRN pod, turning the plane into an all-weather operator. As Israeli engineers had done with all other combat planes purchased for the IAF in the last 50 years, they also updated most of the avionics and introduced many locally-manufactured, cutting-edge improvements. This included completely redone Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) and in-helmet Heads-Up Display (HUD), among multiple other additions like the newest locally-manufactured IR missile the Python-4 and later the Active-Radar-Homing Rafael Derby Missile.

Barak II aircraft have taken part in almost every Israeli military campaign since their introduction, including the Second Lebanon War of 2006. Nevertheless, the changing needs of the Israeli Air Force have created a demand for a more dedicated fighter in the long-distance and precision-strike roles, resulting in the birth of the F-16I "Sufa". This heavily-modified F-16D Block 52 has since completely replaced the ''Barak'' in those roles, leaving it only with mid-altitude interception duties, which it still performs to this day. However, with the F-35 ''"Adir"'' now increasingly filling ''that'' role, there are ever-growing calls within the Israeli military community to finally retire the Barak II.
