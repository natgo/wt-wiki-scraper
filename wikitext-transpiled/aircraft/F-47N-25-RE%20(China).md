== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' represented the later series P-47N (''or F-47N, after USAF nomenclature revisions by early 1950s'') delivered to ROCAF. After the previous P-47D series proved fruitless to the outcome of Chinese Civil War and the stop of military aid to Nationalist forces after their retreat to Taiwan Island, the outbreak of Korean War gave some time for a rest for Nationalists but this also called for supply of jet fighters after ROCAF spotted PLAAF has already been upgraded with more advanced jet fighters. But before USAF can even supply F-84 or future F-86s to Nationalist forces, the latest aircrafts they received were 43 F-47Ns from a certain Air National Guard unit around 1953. Although having somewhat remarkable record of sinking PLAN's gun boat in 1954 and claimed to damage a [[J-2|MiG-15]], the end of propeller fighters put an end of these aircrafts by 1955 with the aforementioned jets, which also marked the end of ROCAF's propeller-driven fighters.

It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]] as one of the premium aircrafts to Chinese tech tree; while the F-47N series were known for their high-altitude performance and endurance with rather long service radius, it also suffers from the overall high mass like other Thunderbolts. But with careful considerations at air battles and its sufficient payload, it can also serve as a more powerful alternative to P-47Ds while maintaining sufficient engine output to escape from danger.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 8 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 4,000 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
F-47N retained the payload from previous Thunderbolts with varieties of bombs and rockets albeit being identical to them as well; but in simple words - leave the bombs for any tough armored targets while the HVAR can finish off light vehicles, give players have extensive experiences to utilize HVAR rockets at maximum efficiency.

* Without load
* 10 x HVAR rockets
* 1 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bomb (500 lb total)
* 3 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (3,000 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Although the P-47N series were specifically designed for long-range escort of the B-29 fleet in Pacific theatre, the introduction of P-51D and the end of WWII by 1945 meant they wouldn't be utilize well during the WWII, the last series of these aircrafts were soon introduced to Air National Guards in US. Meanwhile, the P-47D series which were still used by NRAAF, then the ROCAF were soon proved fruitless to the outcome of Chinese Civil War after the Nationalist's major losses in near Shandong and Zhejiang, this would also be worsen by the end of supply to the Nationalist forces by 1949. However, due to the outbreak of Korean War and the halt of PLA's plans to takeover the remaining territories held by the Nationalists, this also gave the time to rest and plans to attack Mainland China by 1950; [[P-38L-1 (China)|although previous recon flights with the cost of its pilot]] hinted the existence of PLAAF jet fighter fleet, the intensive aerial battles and lack of capacity to build more jet fighters resulted in the delivery of F-47Ns to ROCAF by 1953, 43 fighters from a certain USANG fleet.

Deemed as obsolete by the era, ROCAF claimed to have damage a MiG-15 of PLAAF on 11th, May of 1954 and a flight survived the attacks from MiGs while been known as the aircraft that sunk PLANS Ruijin (瑞金舰; ex-IJN Shishaka 四阪, ship No. 5257) on 18th May, 1954 by 44-89406 (tail No. 306). from 44th Squadron, piloted by He Jianyi (何建彝).

As soon as jet fighters like [[F-84G-21-RE (China)|F-84G]] and [[F-86F-30 (China)|F-86F]] were introduced to ROCAF, they were soon phrased out in 1955.
