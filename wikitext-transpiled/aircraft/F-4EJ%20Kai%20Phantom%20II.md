== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (known as F-4EJ改) was one of the cornerstone of the JASDF based on previous F-4EJs manufactured in Japan; as the airframe and avionics started to become obsolete by early 1980s, MHI and JASDF planned for the upgrades for the fleet of Phantoms with new controls, navigation systems and pulse-doppler radar. After the budget was passed, 90 of these jets were then converted into F-4EJ Kai standards and served JASDF for the next 3 decades until their ultimate decommission in 2021 from ADTW of JASDF.

Introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]] as one of the earliest jets to receive PD radar in future updates, F-4EJ Kai introduced enhanced avionics for the already obsolete airframe of F-4EJ while retaining its combat capabilities against future jets or bombarding enemy ground target with high bomb payload. But be sure plan ahead for any assaults and avoid dogfights with other jets since hit-and-run greatly enhance the survivability of the jet.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Eased up modifications over the F-4EJ
** Comes with 2 x AIM-9Ps stock instead of 2 x AIM-9Bs
** 4 x AIM-9Ps is a tier I mod without the need of AIM-9Es
* A wide range of suspended armaments, suitable for any playstyle
** Powerful AIM-7F SARH missiles
** Top-of-the-line AIM-9L missiles, having excellent manoeuvrability of 30G, long range, great all-aspect tracking, and being somewhat flare resistant
* Deadly frontal armament with high burst mass
* Makes use of a ballistic computer for assisting in the aim of cannons, rockets, and bombs against ground targets
* Large reserve of countermeasures
* AN/APG-66 radar - has diverse scan and tracking modes, very high resistance to notching and chaff, very long range

'''Cons:'''

* Limited ammunition in the frontally-mounted cannon
* Lacks guided ordnance, limiting ground attack ability
* Terrible manoeuvrability along with mediocre acceleration and top speed, particularly compared to common opponents
** Doesn't have an Agile Eagle package like the F-4E and F-4F to increase manoeuvrability

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Since the introduction of the Mitsubishi F-4EJ in 1968, it had been one of the cornerstones of the JASDF along with the F-104J and then later F-15J/DJ; but being a jet from the mid-1960s with inferior avionics and armaments to the latest Soviet jets also meant an extensive upgrade for the fleet of EJs was required. The plans for upgrading the 90 MHI-built F-4EJs which were still airworthy started in 1981 and the first retrofitted jet (07-8431) took to the skies in July 1984 and joined the JASDF in December. Upgrades included:

* Installation of J/AYK-1 guidance system for AShM and unguided bombs
* Replacing AN/APQ-120 with the latest AN/APG-66J with pulse-Doppler capabilities; J/AVQ-3 radar display and guidance system for SARH AAMs
* New J/ASN-4 digital INS navigation system
* New Kaiser Electronics HUD
* J/APR-6 RWR, AN/APX-76A IFF, and AN/ALQ-131 countermeasures
* HOTAS controls
* Lightning rods by the radome
* New fuel tanks

These features passed for the budgets of FY1987 and the upgrades for these jets finished by 1990.

By the time F-15J/DJs and F-2s joined the JASDF in larger quantities, F-4EJs (including the recon variant, RF-4EJ) were starting to retire. On 17 March, 2021, the very last 3 F-4EJ (Kai)s of the JASDF (17-8301[4038], [[F-4EJ ADTW|47-8336]][M036] and 07-8431[M131]) retired from the Air Development and Test Wing (ADTW) in Gifu Airbase, Nagoya, bidding farewell of Phantoms in JASDF service. <ref>https://theaviationist.com/2021/03/17/japans-last-three-f-4ej-phantoms-have-just-flown-for-the-last-time/</ref>

{{notice|'''07-8431 (EJ Kai)''' and '''17-8301 (the very first JASDF EJ)''' were also used for the sampling of the in-game representation of this jet as the developers and DMM announced for a trip to Gifu before their ultimate decommission.<ref>https://warthunder.dmm.com/news/detail/8612</ref>}}
