== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Eased up modifications over the F-4EJ
  ** Comes with 2 x AIM-9Ps stock instead of 2 x AIM-9Bs
  ** 4 x AIM-9Ps is a tier I mod without the need of AIM-9Es
- AN/APG-66J pulse-Doppler radar
- A wide range of suspended armaments, suitable for any playstyle
  \*\* AIM-7F capable
- Deadly frontal armament with high burst mass
- Makes use of a ballistic computer for assisting in the aim of cannons, rockets, and bombs against ground targets
- Large reserve of countermeasures

'''Cons:'''

- Limited ammunition in the frontally-mounted cannon
- Quite large and heavy compared to other fighters at its rank
