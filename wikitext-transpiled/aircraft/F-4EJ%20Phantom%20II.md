== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The F-4EJ Phantom is well-suited for any in-game situation. For attacking ground targets, the plane is armed with an assortment of bombs and rockets, and against air targets, players may employ the vehicle's deadly air-to-air missiles and frontal cannon. If desired, three externally-mounted gun pods may be equipped, but note that these may not be useful in all situations. Although they will undoubtedly increase the vehicle's destructive capabilities, they also appreciably hinder flight performance. In many situations, one front-facing cannon is all that is required to dispatch an opponent aircraft. As for the missiles, the ones used by this plane are among the best in the game, comparable to the [[R-60]] missiles equipped by the [[MiG-21MF (Germany)]] and the [[MiG-21SMT]].

Thanks to its leading-edge flaps, the F-4EJ is more manoeuvrable than the [[F-4C Phantom II]]. Because of this, it can calmly deal with more intense dogfight situations than its predecessor. As with all top-tier fighter jets, extended turn fights should be avoided since they bleed much speed out of this heavy aircraft and leave the pilot defenceless against nearby vultures. Specifically, watch out for the [[J35D]] ''Draken'', which will beat any of its contemporaries in an extended turn, and also keep an eye on nearby [[Mitsubishi T-2]] pilots: although the T-2 doesn't do well in extended turns, it can pull a significant angle of attack in the first few moments of a turn fight. The [[F-4E Phantom II]] can also be considered a threat as it includes leading-edge slats not found on the F-4EJ.

It is advised to side climb up to at least 8,000 m before engaging the enemy to ensure a favourable position at the start of the battle.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fairly manoeuvrable thanks to leading-edge flaps, especially when low on fuel
* AIM-9P air-to-air missiles are among the best in the game (export version of the AIM-9J)
* Equipped with flares for evading enemy missiles
* A wide range of suspended armaments, suitable for any playstyle
* Deadly frontal armament with high burst mass
* Makes use of a ballistic computer for assisting in the aim of cannons, rockets, and bombs against ground targets

'''Cons:'''

* Unlike the [[F-4E Phantom II]], the F-4EJ does not have the Agile Eagle
* Lacks the more capable [[AIM-7E-2]] Sparrow, only has the basic AIM-7E that takes longer to start manoeuvring so it is harder to use in short-range fights
* Limited ammunition in the frontally-mounted cannon
* Quite large and heavy compared to other fighters at its rank

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

F-4EJ "Samurai Phantom" was a jet fighter aircraft that saw service in the JASDF (Japanese Air Self Defense Force) from 1971 until 2020. At the end of 2020, the F-4EJ will be replaced by the F-35A Lightning II.

In 1968 Japan made it public that they would update their JASDF with the F-4 phantom. Being one of the only countries to acquire the permissions to build the plane in their own Factories, Japan started to develop the F-4EJ at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Due to post WW2 sanctions and restrictions, Japan was not allowed to equip any air-to-surface capabilities to the aircraft. As such, the F-4EJ would be made without the AN/AJB-7 bombing computer system.

McDonnell Douglas built the first 2, F-4EJ prototypes with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries building the remaining Phantoms. They did, however, import RF-4EJ from McDonnell Douglas over the 10-year span of production. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would build the very last F-4 in the world, nicknamed "The Finale Phantom", on the 20th of May, 1981. It served with the 306th and 301st Tactical Fighter Squadrons. 127 EJ variant Phantoms were built.

The first squadron equipped with the new F-4EJ would be the 301<sup>st</sup> Hikotai, in August 1<sup>st</sup> 1972. In October 1973, the 301<sup>st</sup> would be deemed operational with the Phantom, having 14 Phantoms in their squadron. On October 30<sup>th</sup> 1978, five years after the squadron was equipped and trained in the Phantom: the 301<sup>st</sup> was designated as JASDF Quick Ready Alert force. In 1979 they would be the first F-4EJ to intercept another aircraft when a Soviet Tu-95 was deemed a threat on February 21st of that year. Ironically the same day of the intercept is when Japan launched the Hakucho X-ray satellite & Corsa-B.

In July of 1984, after the post-war sanctions were dropped, Japan put together plans to upgrade its F-4EJ Phantoms. In 1989 their F-4EJ Phantoms were updated starting with the 306<sup>th</sup> Hikotai. The new Phantoms were equipped with APG-66J pulse-Doppler radar, which allowed the Phantoms to carry out air-to-ground and Air-to-Ship capabilities while being lighter, smaller, and more efficient than the old radar. A new computer and heads up display was added to Phantom, allowing them to bring the Phantom into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Additional upgrades to the pylons allowed the new Phantoms to be equipped with the F-15 fuel tanks, which could sustain more G forces than the current fuel tanks being used. And with the adoption of the Westinghouse AN/ALQ-131 countermeasures, it allowed the pilot to adapt and counter any threats on the modern battlefield quickly. These upgrades were desperately needed for the JASDF as their Mitsubishi F-1 and F-2 did not have the range needed to adequately defend their countries territory if war ever arose. 96 Phantoms were upgraded and designated as F-4EJ Kai (Kai means "Modified" in Japanese).

The F-4EJ Phantoms were equipped with 3 different colour schemes. Blue Camo, Green Camo, and Grey. 127 aircraft were built, with 8 squadrons adopting the plane. The F-4EJ was decommissioned in 2020 to adapt to the F-35A Lightning II.
