== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]]. 

ICE ('''I'''mproved '''C'''ombat '''E'''fficiency) or KWS (Kampfwertsteigerung) program for Luftwaffe F-4F Phantoms introduced due to delays in the Eurofighter development,  this upgrade package brings massive improvements to the sensor suite and arments of the rugged Phantom airframe. 

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
With the flight performance being the same as its predecessor but sitting at much higher BR and facing much superior airframes and missiles, F-4F KWS LV finds itself being massively outclassed in dogfights and might struggle to properly defend itself against modern missiles if those are launched under a certain distance.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Similar to its predecessor and most modern aircraft, F-4F KWS LV boasts no relevant armor at all and instead relies on not being hit in the first place. 

To this end, it is equipped with '''AN/ALE-40 flare/chaff''' dispenser and '''AN/ALR-68(V)3 RWR.''' 

'''AN/ALE-40 flare/chaff dispenser''' provides the aircraft with 60x standard countermeasures and 30x large caliber countermeasures, with no restraints being placed on selection of chaff or flares. 

'''AN/ALR-68(V)3 RWR''' is for in-game purposes the same as the AN/ALR-68 RWR found on its predecessor. It is a digital RWR which means that beside the usual abilities like track and launch detection of radar guided missiles, it is able to display the specific type of enemy radar that engages the aircraft and discern between friend of foe.   

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Pilots should direct their research priority towards unlocking the Flares/Chaff modification due to the nature of threats F-4F KWS LV faces and chaff being almost mandatory to properly defend.

With those unlocked, pilots should ''aim'' (pun intended) for the AIM-120A modification in order to unlock the full potential of the aircraft, with flight performance modifications being researched along the way.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M61A1 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm M61A1 cannon, nose-mounted (640 rpg)
* 30 x large calibre countermeasures
* 60 x countermeasures

20 mm M61A1 cannon remains one of the better cannons found on top tier aircraft, with a hearty ammo supply compared to its contemporaries. 

Large caliber countermeasures offer increased effectiveness over standard countermeasures, both in burn time and luminosity in case of flares, making them superior choice most of the time. Limited supply might be an issue, but proper countermeasures management largely negates this issue. 

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

'''20mm GAU-4 gunpods''' - additional gunpods with M61A1 cannons, providing 1,200 rounds per gun. 

=== '''Air-to-air''' ===
'''AIM-9L/I''' - essentially AIM-9M without the smokeless motor. While easier to detect than AIM-9M, it is still a potent short-range missile due to being a Sidewinder with high G pull and suspended animation IRCCM.

'''AIM-120A''' - main weapon of the F-4F KWS LV, AIM-120As offer never before seen (at least in the German tech tree) capability of engaging enemy aircraft. While incredibly potent, they are not without drawbacks and several things need to be taken into account to ensure a successful launch.

=== '''Air-to-ground''' ===
'''FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets''' - Providing decent performance against ground targets, these rockets sport 290 mm of penetration, and as such they can easily get through roof armour of most vehicles in-game, though some ERA equipped tanks can survive a few hits. While not having enough explosive mass to score kills with indirect hits, the ballistic computer can help with their aiming, and as the plane can equip up to 285 of them, pilots can easily compensate accuracy with quantity.

'''Zuni Mk32 Mod 0 ATAP rockets''' - Major upgrade over Mighty Mouse rockets, their HEAT warhead provides up to 457 mm of penetration and thanks to their explosive mass equivalent to 8.91 kg of TNT, they can severely damage light targets with indirect hits.

'''AGM-65D missile''' - Fire and forget anti-tank missile with IR guidance. Its single-stage HEAT warhead can penetrate up to 830 mm of armor. Depending on the altitude and speed of launching aircraft, it can be launched from stand-off distances. As it is fire and forget, it is great to use in contested airspace, though plane can carry only 2 of them at once. Magnification on its in-built optics is rather low and as such long-range shots are difficult.

'''AGM-65G missile''' - Fire and forget anti-tank missile with IR guidance. Swapping HEAT for SAP-HE warhead, this missile acts more like 50kg rocket boosted bomb. While devastating to light vehicles, heavier targets might be able to withstand its hit. Depending on the altitude and speed of launching aircraft, it can be launched from stand-off distances. As it is fire and forget, it is great to use in contested airspace, though plane can carry only 2 of them at once. Magnification on its in-built optics is rather low and as such long-range shots are difficult.

'''Bombs''' - As is tradition with Phantom airframes, F-4F KWS LV can bring a wide assortment of unguided bombs, ranging from 250 lb to 3000 lb. Beside standard freefall bombs, the plane has access to 500 lb Mk82 Snakeye bombs with high-drag tail fins for low altitude bombing or BLU-27/B napalm bombs..

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
=== Air Battles ===
While the ICE program introduced potent radar and AIM-120s to the Phantom, it did not include any improvements to the Phantom's flight performance. As such, F-4F KWS LV is more oriented towards '''beyond visual range combat'''.

Luckily, the F-4F KWS LV kit is more than sufficient to perform well there. '''AN/APG-65GY radar''' is, without a doubt, the most potent radar that can be found in the German TT. 

When compared to N019E of MiG-29 9.12A/G

* It is extremely hard to notch properly 
* Unlike the aforementioned contemporary, its antenna can rotate while in TWS mode, meaning it can maintain soft-lock while defending
* Has nearly twice the range (120 km as opposed to 65 km)
* Much wider horizontal scan angle (120° vs 60°), but lower vertical can angle (6° vs 30°)

Next centerpiece of its kit are '''AIM-120A''' missiles. While they lack peak speed of '''R-27ER'''s found on MiG-29 9.12A/G (4.0 M vs 5.8 M) and the on-paper maximum range (80 km vs 100 km in head-on), they can pull the same peak G overload (35 Gs for both missiles) and most importantly, AIM-120As are '''ARH (active radar homing)''' missiles, meaning pilots don't need to maintain radar lock in order for the missile to guide itself towards the target. 

However, their active guidance does not mean that the pilot can always fire and forget these missiles and rely on them to shoot down the enemy.

Active radar homing activates once they reach a distance of 16km from the enemy. If AIM-120As are not fed targeting data from the plane radar through data-link, they travel in IOG mode, ie. according to the last known speed and heading of the target, meaning that if the enemy takes defensive action between launch and the activation of active guidance, they might miss entirely.

Thus, to ensure the highest chance of the missile connecting, pilots should always feed targeting data to the missile (ie. keep the radar pointed towards the enemy), as long as it is safe. 

Another important piece of information is that AIM-120s '''don't need hard-lock''' in order to launch like one would need with semi active radar homing missiles, meaning '''they can be fired in TWS mode with soft-lock'''. This is extremely important, since it allows the pilot to engage up to 4 targets simultaneously in TWS mode, and also they dont trigger the "LAUNCH" warning of the enemy RWR until they go pitbull (ie. active their own radar). 

Another thing for pilots to note is the range of the missiles. While '''on-paper''' AIM-120As boast a rather impressive range of 80km, it highly depends on altitude and speed of both attacking and defending aircraft. '''In combat conditions''', the actual range of AIM-120s is closer to 30 km against non-maneuvering targets and 16km against maneuvering ones in head-on situations, and 8 km in tail-chase situations. 

With only 4x AIM-120s available, pilots should always think about what target they are engaging. Targets already notching or about to enter a notch or targets going cold will most likely evade the missile, depending on range, altitude and speed. Similarly, planes flying near hard cover such as mountains and canyons and valleys can use those to hide behind in order to defeat the incoming missile.

Another thing for pilots to note is that with AIM-120s being active radar homing, '''it is extremely dangerous to launch them into furballs''', as they lack any sort of IFF identification and once the missile is off the rails, the pilot can't do anything if the missile decides to go for a friendly plane. 

Defending against enemy ARHs in Phantom can be quite challenging at times, due to the obsolete airframe with its associated poor flight performance. Distance, altitude and speed of both attacking and defending aircraft need to be taken into account. 

Generally speaking, for long distance attacks, '''notching the enemy ARH missile,''' combined with deploying chaff in the last few seconds of attack, can be sufficient defense. However, pilots might get caught off guard if they underestimate the distance at which the enemy missile was launched. As such, '''going cold''' will almost always be a reliable defense against enemy ARH missiles without need to deploy chaff (unless the attacker has a massive altitude advantage). If the enemy ARH missile was launched at extreme ranges of 35 km and higher, pilots could also try a '''F-pole maneuver''' ( “zig zag” flying towards the enemy, ie. turning towards one direction while keeping the enemy on the 2 or 10 clock, continuing flying in that direction for a few seconds, then turning again to 2 or 10 clock).

Alternatively, if the map permits, pilots can '''use the terrain to their advantage'''. While pilots can't rely on multipath cover like previously, they can use mountains, canyons and valleys and other natural obstacles as hard cover to hind behind in order to defeat the missile.

For mid to close range, the aforementioned poor flight performance complicates things, as the pilot might not have enough time to properly defend against enemy ARH missiles. As such, at ranges of 20 km and less, pilots should approach their target already '''cranking''' (keeping the enemy in the absolute gimbal limit of the plane radar) and immediately deploy chaff and go cold as soon as they spot the enemy missile being launched. Alternatively, '''a high speed high G barrel roll''' might defeat the incoming missile, but as the pilots will encounter rather advanced missiles with high G overloads, this might not be a reliable way of defending oneself. 

Within visual range combat dogfight is where the F-4F KWS LV suffers the most. The aforementioned obsolete airframe with associated  poor flight performance, coupled with lack of HMS, thrust-vectoring missiles and mere 90 countermeasures available means that most opponents most likely will win any dogfight Phantom enters. '''As such, it is imperative for the F-4F KWS LV pilots to keep their distance from any enemy, unless they can ambush them from a much more advantageous position.''' 

AIM-9L/Is are relatively good missiles for such scenarios, but the aforementioned lack of HMS and thrust-vectoring means that pilots need to keep some minimal distance from their target, otherwise the missile won't have time to pull towards its target. 

90 countermeasures available also need to be taken into account in dogfight more than in beyond visual range combat, as all missiles found at the top tier have either suspended animation of FoV gate counter-countermeasures installed and either require excessive pre-flaring or dropping a lot of countermeasures in specific ways to defeat the incoming missile. As such, it is best for the F-4F KWS LV to not get shot at at all.

=== Ground battles ===
F-4F KWS LV is the first true modern multirole jet found in the German TT (meaning it can be fully equipped for air-to-air combat while retaining some sort of air-to-ground capability) and as such can be extremely useful in ground battles, only being held back by the limited amount of AGM-65s it can carry. 

Pilots can either take '''CAP (Combat Air Patrol)''' missions, where they provide air cover for ground units against enemy planes. To this end, aforementioned AIM-120s and AIM-9L/Is coupled with potent radar ensure that the enemy plane has to either first deal with the Phantom, or fly much more cautiously and lower to the ground, exposing itself to the ground based air defense assets. 

Or pilots can take '''CAS (Close Air Support)''' missions, providing support directly to the ground troops. To this end, F-4F KWS LV can equip two AGM-65s in either D variant with HEAT warhead or G varian with SAP-HE warhead. Both are potent and it comes down to personal preference which one they should use, as they both have their place in the game. Only two missiles however limit Phantom's usability as CAS aircraft. While it can carry other weapons such as Zuni rockets or unguided bombs, these have limited usefulness at the BR Phantom is placed at, due to the fact the plane needs to get well within the weapon range of ground based air defense assets to use them, and those ground air defense assets being rather potent at close range. 

As previously mentioned however, '''F-4F KWS LV can also do both CAP and CAS at once''', due to the fact that AGM-65s use their own rails and don't interfere with air-to-air weapons.

In the early 1980s, the Luftwaffe initiated a program to improve the combat effectiveness of the F-4F Phantom II then representing Germany's spearhead in air defense. Being launched due to delays in the development of what would eventually become the Eurofighter Typhoon, the F-4F ICE as it became known, was intended to fill this gap until the more advanced aircraft became available. The main goal of the ICE program was to extend the service life of the F-4F by modernizing its avionics and electronic equipment as well as upgrading its radar to enable the aircraft to carry the powerful AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.

The upgrade process began in October 1988 and was carried out in several stages. The first finalized aircraft under the new program were commissioned in the early 1990s. The F-4F KWS LV (ICE) would then continue its service with the Luftwaffe until 2013 before it was ultimately phased out in favor of its successor, the Eurofighter Typhoon.
