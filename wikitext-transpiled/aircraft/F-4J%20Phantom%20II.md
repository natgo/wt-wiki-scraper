== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

The F-4J is a long range support aircraft equipped with long-range AIM-7F and AIM-9G missiles, as well as a very powerful pulse-Doppler radar. Due to it not having the "Agile Eagle" upgrade like the F-4E and having to mount an external gunpod to be able to carry a cannon, it is less manoeuvrable than the F-4E so dogfighting is not recommended.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

When compared to the F-4E, the F-4J is rather sluggish. It lacks the leading edge slats the F-4E has, and as such is less manoeuvrable. Therefore, the F-4J should be used rather as a sniper due to its AIM-7F Sparrow missiles and long range pulse-Doppler radar, which allows it to snipe unsuspecting enemies up to 20 km in frontal attacks. Always remember that most planes at the BR range will out-accelerate the F-4J, and as such, it is vital to maintain your speed.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Equipped with a pulse-Doppler radar, allowing targets close to the ground to be tracked and engaged
- Large selection of unguided munitions for ground attack
- Has a helmet mounted sight to launch AIM-9Gs off-boresight
- Good air-to-air missile combinations
  ** Can carry up to six powerful AIM-7F Sparrow missiles, which have a long burn time resulting in great range and sustained manoeuvrability
  ** AIM-9G IR missiles have good range and decent 18G overload capability
- An ample amount of countermeasures

'''Cons:'''

- Large target
- No guided air-to-ground weaponry
- No internal gun; while an external centerline 20 mm Mk 11 Mod 5 gunpod can optionally be mounted, this impacts performance
- Has poor manoeuvrability as it lacks the F-4E's leading-edge slats
- Top speed and acceleration, while decent, isn't nearly enough to outrun the majority opponents; this is disadvantageous considering the bad manoeuvrability means you absolutely cannot be caught and forced into a dogfight

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The F-4J Phantom is an upgrade of the previous F-4B variant, designed with the intent to improve the Phantom's air-to-air combat capabilities, based on lessons learned in combat during the Vietnam War. These upgrades included a more advanced radar (the AN/APG-59 pulse-Doppler radar), an improved fire control system, upgraded engines, increased options for secondary ordnance, while the infrared sensor under the nose was omitted. Over 500 F-4Js were built from 1966, and saw action at the end of the Vietnam War during Operation Linebacker in 1972. Lt. Randy "Duke" Cunningham and Radar-Intercept Officer Lt. Junior-Grade Willy Driscoll became aces while flying an F-4J, after shooting downing three MiG-17s on May 10, 1972.
