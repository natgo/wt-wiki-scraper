== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The F-4 Phantom II served its most notable service period in the Vietnam War for both the US Air Force (USAF) and US Navy (USN). The USN had the [[F-4J Phantom II|F-4J]] as their latest aircraft, and it began to show its age in the post Vietnam War period. A modernization program began to keep the F-4J up to date with latest upgrades. Improvements were done in avionics, weapon systems, airframe, and undercarriage, but the two most notable improvements were wing leading-edge slats, for improved manoeuvrability, and new smokeless engines. The F-4S flew for USN up until the Phantom's retirement in the late 1980s, replaced by more modern aircraft like the [[F-14A Early|F-14 Tomcat]] and the F-18 Hornet.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], is one of the top versions of the F-4 Phantom II in the game. While the overall play style is not very different from the F-4J, the performance improvements in manoeuvrability should allow the F-4S to occasionally get the upper hand over even more modern fighter designs that it can encounter. Outside the dogfighting range, the usual complement of BVR weaponry like the Sparrows alongside the PD radar should allow the F-4S to shoot down careless enemy fighters who can't evade in time.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
While the F-4S completely lacks any armour plating or ballistic glass, meaning that the pilot and internal systems are exposed to damage from even small arms fire, the airframe itself is relatively sturdy thanks to the upgrades it got to better handle high-G sustained turns, and can take a few hits from opposing aircraft using 20 x 102 mm Vulcan or 20 x 110 mm USN rounds and remain airborne. Higher calibre guns however such as the BK-27 found on the Tornados, and the GSh-30-1 on the MiG-29 have a higher chance of severely crippling your performance or outright destroying the aircraft. As with the F-4J, the RIO (Radar Intercept Officer) in the back of the cockpit cannot take control of the aircraft if the pilot is knocked out, as it lacks the dual controls found on the USAF variants of the Phantom (C & E.)

The fuel tanks are self-sealing, but generally won't be able to stop a fire from igniting due to every aircraft at the F-4S' BR using guns that are at least 20 mm in calibre. They also take up a lot of space in the midsection and rear of the Phantom, making shots to the fuselage potentially fatal. There are additional fuel tanks located in the upper-front of the wings and in the bottom of the fuselage, but they are a much smaller and thinner target, so the chances that they get hit are much lower in comparison. You have an extinguisher to put out engine fires, but effectiveness may vary depending on the severity of damage to the rest of the airframe, along with your airspeed.

It is important to note that your countermeasures fire in pairs of two; with the introduction of separate flare/chaff firing, it is now possible to optimize your countermeasure drops in order to defend against both SARH and IR air-to-air missiles. 60 countermeasures at this BR is roughly the norm, but as you may face ARH missiles in the form of AIM-120As on the [[AV-8B_Plus|AV-8B+]] it is best to keep the idea of chaffing separately in the back of your head at all times.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Being a slightly upgraded F-4J, the F-4S retains many of its predecessor's defining characteristics.

The main difference between the two is the F-4S' leading edge wing slats. These greatly increase manoeuvrability below ~970-1000 km/h SPD by allowing you to pull more AoA (Angle of Attack) which helps to tighten down your turning circle, but results in noticeably more energy bleed. Inversely, the slats will reduce the amount of AoA you can pull above the priorly-mentioned airspeed, which massively improves energy retention and delays pilot blackouts at the cost of an overall wider turn circle. This ability to control your AoA at various speeds can be an invaluable tool in winning engagements if properly mastered, but remember that you're still a Phantom; the F-4S can't turn tight enough to competitively dogfight most other top-tier aircraft even with the manoeuvrability upgrade, but it's good enough that you may be able to last in an extended engagement against a single opponent until an ally comes to your aid. <!--Testing was done with a loadout consisting of 6 Sparrows and the gunpod with 30:23 / a full tank of fuel at ~1,000 ft and ~6,500 ft, starting from ~1,190-1,210 km/h SPD. RB physics and good weather were selected with limited fuel and ammo disabled, and the test location was Peale Island. Testing was performed by continually turning horizontally with combat flaps deployed and full WEP at both specified altitudes while maintaining said altitude as best as possible.-->


The most powerful aspect of the F-4S is its weaponry. For IR-guided missiles, it carries AIM-9Hs, which are functionally very similar to their predecessor, the AIM-9Gs. Even though they have a fairly average turn performance with a max overload of 18G, their respectable range and long guidance time make them ideal for picking off inattentive players or AI planes. The crown jewel of the F-4S' arsenal however is the AIM-7F Sparrow, a Semi-Active Radar Homing missile. With enough range to reliably hit 15km+ shots from front-aspect, it offers a much needed range boost from the lacking-in-range AIM-7E-2s and starts pulling in much faster than AIM-7Es, making them an excellent all-rounder missile. Head-on snapshots from less than 3 km can be done, but you'll be pushing the limits of both your radar's lock speed and the Sparrow's 25G pull limit, so it may be beneficial to roll your aircraft to lessen the G load the missile will have to pull in some circumstances.

There are two types of vehicles you have to be wary of in the F-4S as of current: 4th generation fighters that completely outclass you, and Harriers. First off, 4th generation fighters such as the [[F-14 (Family) | F-14]], [[F-15A]], [[F-16A]] and [[MiG-29]] all have you completely beat in terms of flight performance. While you may attempt to fight them in a 1v1, unless the enemy pilot makes a severe lapse in judgement it will be all but certain you will be the one ejecting out of your plane. On the topic of missile armament, while the F-15A still comes equipped with AIM-7Ms (which are functionally identical to your AIM-7Fs) and the F-16A lacks SARH/ARH missiles, the F-14 comes equipped with the AIM-54 Phoenix Active Radar Homing (ARH) missile which has an effective launch range at least twice that of your 7Ms and the MiG-29 has 2 R-27ER/ET SARH missiles which have better range, a stronger motor and significantly faster speeds than your AIM-7M can hope to achieve, meaning even if you launch first you may not be guaranteed a win. The latter two aircraft also come equipped with a Track-While-Scan (TWS) mode capable radar, which can easily give your position away even from extreme ranges while your radar needs a hard lock to make sure if a target is, in fact, an enemy flying towards you at maximum speed. 

The second problem you may face is, as said prior, Harriers. This may sound odd, as Harriers are a much lower Battle Rating than the F-4S, and even in a 1v1 situation aren't excellent dogfighters unless they take full advantage of their VTOL capabilities, but it is also of the most vital importance to remember the [[AV-8B_Plus | AV-8B+]] for the simple fact that it has AIM-120As. ARH missiles are much less reliant on holding a lock on the target than SARH missiles due to the seeker built into the missile itself, so all the AV-8B+ has to do is obtain a lock within visual range (<10km or so) and fire a missile at you, as the missile's own seeker will almost instantly turn itself on and lock your aircraft. To dodge these ARH missiles, you should first lower your altitude (if possible) to be as close to ground level as possible, as multipathing means that the missiles will not be able to track you properly if you are hugging the ground. However, this may not always be possible, or the terrain may have too many trees to realistically dive down and hold that altitude - so in that case, what should you do? The ideal way to dodge an ARH missile is not to try and notch the missile (keeping the missile lock 90 degrees to your aircraft), as the missile seeker is not as easily spoofed as a SARH missile. Instead, you should strive to 'go cold', i.e. turn a full 180 degrees around from the missile to make it harder for the missile to track you - in general, it is recommended to try both and see what works best for you depending on the situation you're in. What matters is the ability to be aware of the possibilty of facing ARH in a full uptier, so you can control your encounters as much as possible. 

Base bombing is, as expected for the Phantoms, and no exception to the F-4S, a completely viable strategy thanks to its impressive bomb load. It also has some merit in attacking ground targets, as it can carry a ludicrous amount of Mighty Mouse rockets (Up to a maximum of 247 if you wish to forgo the gun pod) that are very easy to aim thanks to having a rocket CCIP, and you can still carry 4 Sparrows to have a strong weapon against enemy aircraft. Avoid SPAA vehicles like the plague, as getting too close may spell an untimely return to the hangar, and the lack of guided munitions means you have to get close to or within their firing range to deal with them, either with bombs or rockets.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

The F-4S is a variant of the F-4 Phantom II, a twin-engine, all-weather jet fighter-bomber originally developed by McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing) for the United States Navy in the 1950s. The F-4S was the final production version of the F-4, and saw extensive service during the Cold War and in various conflicts around the world. The F-4S was an upgraded F-4J, with slats and a better turn speed.

The F-4S was developed in response to the need for an advanced fighter-bomber that could operate in all weather conditions and perform a wide range of missions, including air-to-air combat, ground attack, and reconnaissance. It featured improved avionics, a more powerful engine, and upgraded weapons systems compared to earlier variants of the F-4.

One of the F-4S's most significant upgrades was its advanced radar system, which could track multiple targets at once and provide the pilot with a clear picture of the battlefield. It was also equipped with a more sophisticated weapons delivery system, which allowed it to carry a wider variety of bombs and missiles, including the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, as well as multiple types of unguided bombs and rockets.

The F-4S saw extensive service with the US Navy and Marine Corps. It was used in a variety of conflicts, including the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the Gulf of Sidra incident.

Despite its success in combat, the F-4S was eventually phased out of service in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as newer and more advanced fighter aircraft were introduced into the US military fleet. Today, several examples of the F-4S can be found on display in aviation museums and military bases around the world, serving as a reminder of the aircraft's important role in military history.
