== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
South Vietnam received over 150 F-5 fighters, some of which were F-5Es. After the fall of Saigon, many of these F-5s were evacuated to Thailand, however some still fell into Soviet and Vietnamese hands. These evacuated F-5s began a new life in Thailand, who operated about 70 of them in their own air force. All of these F-5s except the F-5Es were retired not long after. The F-5Es however were upgraded multiple times throughout their life and continue to see service with the Royal Thai Air Force to this day, and are not expected to retire until at least 2025-2030.

Introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a squadron aircraft in the Japanese tech tree. It plays with all the major advantages of the other F-5Es in-game, being incredibly light and highly manoeuvrable resulting in some of the best energy retention on any jet aircraft at its battle rating range. The Thai F-5E however also solves one of the few downsides of the other F-5Es, the sub-par missiles. The F-5E FCU gets access to four all-aspect missiles instead of the usual two rear-aspect only missiles found on other F-5s in-game. In addition to this, it receives the usual great complement of ground ordnance that F-5s get, providing an incredible CAS option for Japan players in mixed battles. All in all, the F-5E FCU is a great all-rounder for almost every role it can find itself in for its battle rating, and is generally a forgiving vehicle to play and easy to learn even for less experienced pilots.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* A small target with good manoeuvrability makes it a difficult target to hit
* Uses Python 3 IR missiles
* Can attack ground targets from a distance with the AGM-65B
* All IR missiles can be slaved by the radar
* Modern HUD with sight customization, good for simulator battles

'''Cons:'''

* AGM-65B does not have a thermal camera, which makes it weather dependent
* Despite having 4 hardpoints, it cannot carry 4 Pythons 3
* Radar only has standard pulse mode
* No radar missiles

The Royal Thai Air Force received the first F-5 series aircraft in the late 1960s during the Vietnam War, where the resulting aircraft were equipped purely as attack aircraft. The country began receiving more advanced F-5Es in the late 70s. In 1988, the modernization of part of the F-5E fleet began. They received a HUD, a new sight with a ballistic computer, countermeasures, an RWR and the ability to install Python 3 missiles. Even though the Royal Thai Air Force have begun using F-16 fighters, the F-5 series of aircraft remain in service to this day.
