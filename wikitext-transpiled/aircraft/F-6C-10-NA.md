== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Wind of Change"]] as reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VII, "Armoured Elephant"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 38 mm Bulletproof glass - Windshield
* 11.11 mm Steel - Behind pilot's seat
* 6.35 mm Steel - Behind engine, in front of oil cooling system and pilot
* 6.35 mm Steel - In front of upper engine
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 in each wing, 1 behind pilot)

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (280 rpg outer + 350 rpg inner = 1,260 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The overheating issue of the plane can be completely negated with use of manual engine controls. Note that due to its use of the Meredith effect, the radiator of the F-6C-10-NA produces almost no drag regardless of how wide it is opened.

* Set the propeller pitch to 90-95%
* Set the water radiator to 100% and oil cooler to 80%. Both can be reduced as you climb to higher altitudes

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent top speed and acceleration 
* Excellent dive speed and acceleration
* Excellent boom and zoom capability 
* Great high altitude performance
* Great climb rate 
* Good turning ability at high speeds

'''Cons:'''

* 4x 12.7mm M2 Browning machine guns with late war belts, while generally adequate, may sometimes be lacking, especially against armored or large aircraft 
* Below average roll rate
* High stall speed 
* Mediocre manoeuvrability at medium to low speeds
* Wing mounted guns, therefore convergence is a small issue 
* No payloads at all (therefore no bombs or rockets for ground attack) 

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

F-6C-10-NA reconnaissance fighters were converted from serial P-51C-10-NT Mustangs by installing photographic equipment. The F-6 series is a Photo Reconnaissance modification of the P-51A, P-51B, P-51C, P-51D & P-51K. The exact number of P-51s converted to F-6s is not known, but it is believed to be around 500 units.<ref>http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_F-6_Mustang.html</ref>

Other Members of this Family Include the F-6B-NA (35 Converted P-51A), F-6C-NT (Unknown Number of Converted P-51C), F-6D-NA/NT (283 Converted P-51D), and the F-6K-NT (163 Converted P-51K)

In-Game, the F-6C-NA is a P-51B-10-NA modified with a Malcolm Hood, which balloons outwards and increases both headroom & side visibility. The Malcolm hood was used mostly by the RAF and their Mustang III's, though American use of the Malcolm hood did occur, the majority remained with the original Canopy design.

The first field modifications of the P-51 Mustang series for tactical photo reconnaissance appeared in the UK in 1941. In 1942, the United States began their conversion of P-51 Mustang fighters of various series into a reconnaissance fighter by equipping them with one or two bulky K-24 cameras manufactured by Kodak. These aircraft were used by the US Air Force, Britain, Australia, and were also delivered abroad under the Lend-Lease program. The reconnaissance Mustang was actively used during the Allied offensive in Europe, as well as in Tunisia and in the Pacifics.
