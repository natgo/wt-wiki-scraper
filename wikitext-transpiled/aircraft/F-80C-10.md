== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.33]].

The F-80C-10's major performance upgrade from the A-5 is that it comes with WEP. This additional power significantly increases acceleration, allowing it to match that of the British Meteor series. It also allows for a last-resort method to escape if it happens to get jumped on. However, WEP only lasts for 1:40, and once that runs out, there is no thrust increase available.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Like most American fighters, your best option to attack is Boom and Zoom. At the start of the match, fly out towards the edge of the map. Climb at 2-3 degrees until you have reached ~770 km/h (~420 knots) at ~910 metres (~3,000 ft), then zoom climb at 20-30 degrees. Once you have slowed down to 287 km/h (155 kt), continue to climb at a solid 10 degrees. Optimally, you should have between 3.7-4.9 km (12,000-16,000 ft) depending on how high the highest enemy is, before turning in towards the area of conflict (continue to climb or maintain altitude). Only once you have selected a target should you dive and make your pass. Always keep your energy high, whether it be speed or altitude. Because the F-80 is frequently uptiered, the best option is to dive on unsuspecting targets that are occupied engaging your teammates.

Defensive flying, rolling scissors, and to some degree, turn fighting, are options with the hydraulic boosters upgrade, as the straight wing as compared to 9.0 jets with swept wings provides better manoeuvrability at medium speeds (463-648 km/h, 250-350 knots). Any higher and the control surfaces begin to stiffen, any lower and you risk stalling out first, as jets with higher BR generally have a better thrust-to-weight ratio.

If you are given an awkward firing angle (e.g.: your target is near ground level and you are diving at a steep angle) or you fail to destroy them on your first pass, slowly pull your aircraft back up into a straight vertical climb to recover as much altitude as possible. If you persist on knocking out your target, you risk crashing into the ground from control stiffening or getting strafed by another enemy because you are losing your energy in a dogfight.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Good acceleration and climb rate
- Effective weapons
- Can outturn MiG-15s when the need arises

'''Cons:'''

- Relatively slow dive speed
- Average level flight speed
- Poor turn rate at 400-500 km/h
- Overall useless in a uptier, it is just too slow
- Just 100 seconds of WEP in RB, it is only there for emergencies

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

An all-metal, single-seat fighter-bomber with one turbojet engine. The aircraft was created by a group of Lockheed engineers (headed by Clarence "Kelly" Johnson) in only 143 days.

The first flight of the XP-80 prototype was performed in January 1944. The first production version, designated the P-80A Shooting Star, entered service in 1946. The P-80 became the first combat-capable jet aircraft to enter service with the USAAF.

1947 saw the appearance of the next production version of the aircraft, the P-80B. The ninth production P-80A-1 was converted to a new prototype, designated the XP-80B. It had an Allison J33-A-17 turbojet engine producing 1,816 kg of thrust, equipped with a methanol-water injection system. The airfoil was thinner, but the skin's thickness was increased. To install a water mixture tank, the plane's fuel quantity had to be sacrificed by reducing it from 1,781 to 1,610 liters The aircraft also received a Lockheed-designed ejection seat and a cockpit air-conditioning system.

The plane's armament consisted of six 12.7 mm Colt-Browning M3 machine guns with 300 rounds each in the forward fuselage. One 1,000 lb (454 kg) bomb or ten 5-inch (127 mm) unguided HVAR missiles could be suspended under each wing panel.

A total of 240 P-80B fighter-bombers were built from March 1947 to March 1948, including P-80B-1s and 31 P-80B-5s. The B-5 variant was intended to be operated in Arctic conditions; its heated canopy prevented icing. In addition, special types of oil and special rubber were used to operate the aircraft in low temperature conditions.

At least five P-80Bs were equipped with a guidance system for Bell GAM-63 RASCAL air-to-surface missiles. Externally, these aircraft differed in the shape of the forward fuselage and the wing-mounted tanks. Also, they were fitted with extra spoilers on the upper and lower wing surfaces.

In June 1948, when the US military aircraft designation system was changed, the P-80B was renamed to the F-80B.

When the Korean War started, F-80Bs were stationed in the USA and in Europe, being used by the USAAF mainly for training purposes. Later, 117 F-80Bs were brought up to the F-80C's standards and re-designated "F-80C-12". The remaining F-80Bs were withdrawn from service by the end of 1951.
