== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
With the introduction of the first jet-powered domestically produced French aircraft, the French Air Force required a dedicated close air support and strike platform. With the Vautour II still in development and also being a very large aircraft for certain strike missions, France looked elsewhere for an aircraft capable of fulfilling this role. With the introduction of the United States of the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak, France negotiated the acquisition of this aircraft, already having experience operating the regular F-84. The aircraft was introduced in 1954 with the USAF, and by 1955 the first F-84Fs arrived, a total of 328 F-84Fs and 88 RF-84Fs were bought from the US.

It was introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]]. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a dedicated strike platform that is common amongst various tech trees in War Thunder. It features a sizable loadout, a good top speed, decent manoeuvrability, easy-to-use guns and a CCRP ballistic computer for its bombs with CCIP for the cannons. The F-84F lacks an air spawn being located at rank VI, and due to its below-average acceleration, it might be one of the last to reach the battlefield when armed with bombs. For air combat the F-84s performance is very good at high speeds, so try to gain altitude and keep your speed above Mach 0.8 in most situations.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The F-84F is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Can carry a decent amount of bombs and rockets, being able to destroy a base and after light targets or tanks with the rockets
* Gets an airspawn and being extremely useful for a F84F at the start of the match
* Somewhat fast and with a good top speed
* Has an analog ballistic computer (CCRP) with its use being very helpful for bombing at higher altitudes safely and with precision

'''Cons:'''

* While fast as long as it has enough energy, it can still be reached or outrun by some planes, mainly by any variant of the F-86 sabre
* Slow acceleration, and even bad fully loaded with bombs
* 12.7 mm armament does not do enough damage in the short engagement windows of jet dogfights
* Fragile, any 20+ mm calibre cannons will shred the aircraft if they hit
* Elevator locks up heavily above 800 km/h
* Loses a lot of speed on sharp turns
* Can easily lose a turn fight to jet bombers and twin jet fighters

=== [[wt:en/news/6990-development-f-84f-thunderstreak-en|Devblog]] ===
In the late 1940's, the manufacturer 'Republic' sought to improve the performance of the F-84 in order to bring it closer in line with the F-86 Sabre. As a result, it developed a new variant of the Thunderjet, designated F-84F. The new aircraft featured, among other changes, a new swept wing and a more powerful engine than its predecessor. Although Republic initially intended the new aircraft to be an extensive modernization of the base F-84, possessing a high degree of part compatibility with preceding variants, in the end, only less than 20% of the parts were interchangeable, resulting in the F-84F Thunderstreak becoming its own independent design.

Following its maiden flight in the early 1950's, the F-84F was ordered into production. However, the USAF focus on strategic bombers at the time resulted in some critical component manufacturing processes being prioritized for bomber production, ultimately leading to a staggered production start of the new F-84F.

The Thunderstreak officially entered service with the USAF in 1954, but was quickly phased out of active service due to engine issues before being reactivated in the early 1960's as tensions between the two superpowers began to rise again. Ultimately, the F-84F kept flying under American colors well into the early 1970's before finally being retired as newer aircraft replaced the Thunderstreak in active service.

The F-84F was also widely exported to NATO members. Chiefly among them were Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, China, the Netherlands as well as others. In total, well over 2,100 F-84F Thunderstreaks were built, with the Greek Air Force being the last to retire their F-84Fs in 1991.
