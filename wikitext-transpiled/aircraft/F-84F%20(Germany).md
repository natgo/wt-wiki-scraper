=== Survivability and armour ===

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
For modifications, as with almost all jets in the German tree, performance and survivability mods should be priority, except for the booster which really is not all that necessary and lends itself to more wing rips. G-Suit is a must. The six .50 caliber guns are accurate enough baselines as is the ammo, so go for the bombs and/or rockets next.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The F-84F gets a bad rap, but it is a surprisingly fun aircraft to fly, more so once spaded. The air spawn is a big help in grinding up the aircraft modifications. Until the bombs are unlocked, use the advantage of the air spawn to climb and look for bombers. If no bombers are present, look for fighters engaging friendlies.

Keep the F-84F's speed around 700 km/h when climbing. The aircraft has relatively good dive acceleration and top end for its BR. This makes it a natural for Boom and Run tactics. Make sure the plane is set up so the run is either toward the airfield or friendlies so that any chasers will be picked off by allies and or the airfield's anti-air defenses. Try to engage at as close to 1,000 km/h as possible and do not try to turn if the target goes evasive. This aircraft has terrible acceleration, so it is important to keep the F-84F's speed up. Quite often the F-84F will get chasers with AIM-9Bs. Keep a look out for them and use occasional hard manoeuvres to break lock. Fortunately, it does not take much to break lock of the AIM-9Bs.

For the payload usage, the rockets, though inaccurate, are still fun to use en masse against targets, especially the Mighty Mouse rockets with a total of 42 rockets. However, the drag from the Mighty Mouse launchers is a problem. For bombs, the F-84F can effectively base bomb at the BR with the four 1,000 lb Mk 83s and be able to engage unsuspecting targets during the return to the airfield. Just remember, no turn fighting. When attempting to dive-bomb targets, use the air brakes to be able to adjust the planes better during its descent onto the target. When all bombs are expended and the F-84F begins their landing approach, use the air brake to help decelerate the plane to a manageable landing speed for the gears and flaps, then rely on the drogue chute to stop the plane on the airfield.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The F-84F is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* 4 nose-mounted .50 cals plus 2 near the side of the airframe making accurate shots possible
* A lot of variety of choices for ground ordnance
* Good acceleration in a steep dive

'''Cons:'''

* Turning is below average so don't expect to last long in a dogfight with any aircraft
* While turning, speed is bled a lot so maintain your speed
* Will commonly face air-to-air missiles, any of which it has difficulty evading
* Most jets will catch up to you due to the poor acceleration
* The .50 cals are underpowered for its rank
* The FFAR rockets are placed at the wing tips, this will result in poor accuracy

=== [[wt:en/news/6990-development-f-84f-thunderstreak-en|Devblog]] ===
In the late 1940's, the manufacturer 'Republic' sought to improve the performance of the F-84 in order to bring it closer in line with the F-86 Sabre. As a result, it developed a new variant of the Thunderjet, designated F-84F. The new aircraft featured, among other changes, a new swept wing and a more powerful engine than its predecessor. Although Republic initially intended the new aircraft to be an extensive modernization of the base F-84, possessing a high degree of part compatibility with preceding variants, in the end, only less than 20% of the parts were interchangeable, resulting in the F-84F Thunderstreak becoming its own independent design.

Following its maiden flight in the early 1950's, the F-84F was ordered into production. However, the USAF focus on strategic bombers at the time resulted in some critical component manufacturing processes being prioritized for bomber production, ultimately leading to a staggered production start of the new F-84F.

The Thunderstreak officially entered service with the USAF in 1954, but was quickly phased out of active service due to engine issues before being reactivated in the early 1960's as tensions between the two superpowers began to rise again. Ultimately, the F-84F kept flying under American colors well into the early 1970's before finally being retired as newer aircraft replaced the Thunderstreak in active service.

The F-84F was also widely exported to NATO members. Chiefly among them were Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, China, the Netherlands as well as others. In total, well over 2,100 F-84F Thunderstreaks were built, with the Greek Air Force being the last to retire their F-84Fs in 1991.
