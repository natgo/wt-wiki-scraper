== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]] and was removed from the French tech tree following the introduction of the [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The F-84F has the somewhat common base armament of 6 x M3 Browning machine guns. This combined with its large ammo capacity makes for an aircraft well-suited to dogfighting. Achieving air superiority should be the primary task for all F-84F pilots, the F-84F also excels in a support role, where most of enemies can't simply run away from it. In air battles, it has access to an airspawn, which means that you are able to engage enemies more quickly, giving the F-84F a very aggressive type of playstyle. It is recommended to bring minimal fuel to boost its acceleration and climb rate, do note that bringing a lot of payload will seriously affect your overall mobility, the more payload the heavier, and slower, the aircraft is. If you are inclined to bring a lot of payload, make sure you dispose of it before entering a dogfight, as more often than not you will be knocked out as your flight characteristics won't be on par with most enemies you'll face. When the first enemies engage with allies, go over them and find targets with low energy states and destroy them. Do not chase lone planes, as although the enemy might look like an easy 1-vs-1 victory, the F-84F's low top speed makes it very hard to catch somebody. Try not to engage in a prolonged dogfight, because the F-84F has rather poor energy retention and when caught slow even good acceleration won't save the plane. In a prolonged turnfight, one may find themselves losing even against jets like the MiG-15. Another thing is that you have an adequate ammunition count, so in theory you could stay in combat for a long time if you time your shots and selectively engage enemies you have an advantage over. Destroying bombers and attackers is also a feasible option thanks to the powerful armament.

The aircraft can also be employed in ground strike or destruction of enemy bases with its more than sufficient maximum bomb load of 4 x 1,000 lb Mk.83 bombs and somewhat less impressive selection of 24 HVAR rockets.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The F-84F is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Gets an airspawn as a strike aircraft
* Six .50 calibre machine guns as main armament gives plenty of firing time to get a hit in
* Diverse payload options in rockets or bombs
* Top speed matches that of other contemporary aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* .50 calibre armament is not very powerful, requires longer hit times to do sufficient damage to enemy aircraft
* Rate of climb is rather poor
* Payload restricted to one type of ordnance, rockets or bombs
* Turn time is poorer than other contemporary fighters

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== [[wt:en/news/6990-development-f-84f-thunderstreak-en|Devblog]] ===
In the late 1940's, the manufacturer 'Republic' sought to improve the performance of the F-84 in order to bring it closer in line with the F-86 Sabre. As a result, it developed a new variant of the Thunderjet, designated F-84F. The new aircraft featured, among other changes, a new swept wing and a more powerful engine than its predecessor. Although Republic initially intended the new aircraft to be an extensive modernization of the base F-84, possessing a high degree of part compatibility with preceding variants, in the end, only less than 20% of the parts were interchangeable, resulting in the F-84F Thunderstreak becoming its own independent design.

Following its maiden flight in the early 1950's, the F-84F was ordered into production. However, the USAF focus on strategic bombers at the time resulted in some critical component manufacturing processes being prioritized for bomber production, ultimately leading to a staggered production start of the new F-84F.

The Thunderstreak officially entered service with the USAF in 1954, but was quickly phased out of active service due to engine issues before being reactivated in the early 1960's as tensions between the two superpowers began to rise again. Ultimately, the F-84F kept flying under American colors well into the early 1970's before finally being retired as newer aircraft replaced the Thunderstreak in active service.

The F-84F was also widely exported to NATO members. Chiefly among them were Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, China, the Netherlands as well as others. In total, well over 2,100 F-84F Thunderstreaks were built, with the Greek Air Force being the last to retire their F-84Fs in 1991.
