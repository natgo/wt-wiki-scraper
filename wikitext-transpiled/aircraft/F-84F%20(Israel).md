== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The first F-84s operating under the command of the Israeli Air Force flew during the 1956 Suez Crisis. Three French air squadrons were deployed to Israel in order to help in the invasion of the Suez peninsula, but these aircraft were painted with IAF colours in order to mask French involvement in the war.

This aircraft was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]] and it is a very good strike aircraft. While it doesn't have the best flight performance, electronics or offensive weapons, it compensates this with good versatility. With its CCRP for bombs, it's capable of destroying bases and static ground targets with precision. As a strike aircraft, it gets an air spawn, making it one of the firsts in the battle, and would almost always reach bases if it's trying to go for a bomb run. After releasing its payload however, the F-84F has decent manoeuvrability and its 6 x 12.7mm HMGs make it a dangerous opponent in head-ons.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The F-84F has decent flight performance for a Strike Aircraft. Having similar performance to the A-4 Skyhawk but with less acceleration and climb rate. However in a dogfight it has good energy retention but it wont win any energy fight against a MiG-15 or MiG-17. Having a pair of powerful airbrakes and a good roll rate, it's pretty easy to force faster enemies to overshoot.

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The F-84F has decent armour surrounding the pilot including bulletproof glass and steel plates. However there is no armour for critical systems and everything is packed together in the middle of the aircraft. A few hits to the middle of the aircraft will most likely destroy it.

* All fuel tanks are self sealing
* 8mm steel plate behind the pilot
* 12.7mm steel plate in upper part of the seat
* 38mm Armoured glass in front of the pilot

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The F-84F is a strike aircraft, and it should be used as such. Because it lacks the air-to-air capabilities to destroy most enemies, its best opportunity is to go for bases and ground targets.

When facing an uptier or similar BR opponents, using the air spawn to get to the closest base as fast as possible and go back to the safety of your team is your best bet. However if used in air-to-air roles, it is good to know that the F-84F is capable of holding its energy very well if it's in a high energy state. But even with this it wont hold against several fighters alone, and good positioning and team effort is needed to survive.

In downtiers, the F-84F can use its air spawn and good top speed to go for bombers and dive to attack enemies slower than you, since most fighters with a lower BR than the F-84F have much less power and thus would be easy to eliminate with boom-and-zoom tactics. Energy fighting in downtiers is much more important, since early jets can outmanoeuvre the F-84F at low speeds where its bulky airframe makes it an easy target for any aircraft.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The F-84F is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft. It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Gets an airspawn as a strike aircraft
* Six .50 cal machine guns with a lot of ammo and a high fire rate as main armament gives plenty of firing time to get a hit in
* Diverse payload options in rockets or bombs
* Top speed matches that of other contemporary aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* .50 cal MGs are not very powerful, require longer hit times to do sufficient damage to enemy aircraft
* Rate of climb is rather poor
* Payload restricted to one type of ordnance, rockets, or bombs
* Turn radius is worse than other contemporary fighters
* Slow acceleration gives time for most enemies to catch up to you  

== History ==

In 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made plans to construct a dam across the river Nile at Aswan - a massive project that could radically change the Egyptian economy and solve many dire problems he had been facing. However, the World Bank refused his request for a loan, without which the project could not proceed. In retaliation, Nasser declared his country's sovereignty over the Suez Canal - the artificial waterway connecting the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea - which until that point had been co-owned by the UK government and the French public. While Egypt's army moved to take the canal from its European civilian operators, Egyptian naval forces moved to block the Straits of Tiran at the mouth of the Red Sea to prevent any Israeli ships from entering it. This move marked the beginning of an event known today as the "1956 Suez Crisis".

The United Kingdom and France were determined to retake the canal; however it was clear to the leaders of both countries that the world (and particularly the United States) would see such action as an unwarranted invasion, or even as an attempt by the Europeans to re-colonize Egypt. Fortunately for them, Nasser's manoeuvre to block the Straits of Tiran violated the 1949 cease-fire agreement with Israel and provided it with a legitimate casus belli. As such, Israel, France, and the UK began a series of clandestine meetings in which their leaders discussed a tripartite operation. It was finally decided that Israel would use its casus belli to attack the Suez Canal, whereupon France and the UK would invade under the pretence of a "peace-keeping operation" and retake the canal for themselves.

Israel, however, had one major problem with the operation - the Israeli Air Force (IAF) was still relatively weak, especially compared to the Soviet-equipped Egyptians; it had only been established less than a decade earlier, and half of its combat planes were still World War II-era prop-driven fighters. With most of the IAF's jet fighters busy supporting the planned airborne invasion of the Sinai Peninsula, the IAF would not be able to defend Israel itself against any Egyptian attempt to bombard Israeli cities using [[IL-28]] jet bombers. Therefore, in one of the final meetings with the French and British representatives, Israel's Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion made a key demand: the French Air Force would have to take over the duties of protecting the skies over Israel. France agreed to this demand.

Shortly before the start of the operation, three French air squadrons were relocated to bases in Israel. Totalling 36 jet fighters, these squadrons would be tasked solely with protecting the Israeli airspace against any incursions by Egyptian aircraft. However, in order to mask France's involvement in the Israeli invasion, the planes would have to be disguised as IAF planes. Three new IAF squadrons were "invented" for them, and the planes themselves were repainted in IAF colours and markings. On their way to Israel, the planes had to make a stop-over at Brindisi, Italy; the Italian authorities were told that these were Israeli jets being flown back from repairs in France.

One of these French squadrons, renamed "IAF Squadron 200" for the duration of the operation, brought 18 F-84F fighter jets. It was stationed at Lod Air Force Base (next to Israel's main international airport) and was tasked with providing the first line of defense. However, by the end of the short war it turned out that Ben-Gurion's worries had been unfounded: the Egyptians were either reluctant or incapable of sending bombers into Israeli airspace, and the three French squadrons saw no action during the war. With the exception of one false alarm, none of the French planes stationed in Israel ever took off.
