== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In 1949, a plan to increase the performance of the straight-wing F-84 Thunderjet was developed. A swept-wing version was designed to increase the speed and range. At low-altitude, the speed was much better than the previous F-84E. However, overall performance was still lacklustre so the USAF wanted a better engine to improve the climb and high-altitude performance. Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engines were selected and eventually Curtiss-Wright would build them under license as the J65. After constant setbacks during production, deliveries finally rolled in until 1957 when over 2,000 F-84F Thunderstreaks were built. Pilots enjoyed the Thunderstreak as it was robust and flew well in turbulent conditions. However, it required a high landing speed and certain manoeuvres were far too dangerous to perform. They were gradually replaced by the F-100 Super Sabre until the Berlin Crisis reactivated many Thunderstreaks. They would eventually find their way into the Air National Guard until the early 1970s when they were finally retired in US service.

Introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]], the F-84F is a decent aircraft with some flaws. Although the Thunderstreak is relatively fast, it struggles to reach that speed in an acceptable amount of time. Carrying bombs also greatly diminishes the acceleration so players should carry a light fuel load to offset the weight. The six nose-mounted 12.7 mm machine guns are sufficient for ground attack, but attacking enemy aircraft can be frustrating due to the lack of sufficient stopping power. Overall, the F-84F Thunderstreak is a fairly decent strike aircraft but performance limitations and its battle rating hinder its effectiveness.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The F-84F Thunderstreak has six fuel tank modules. Two are mounted within the fuselage of the aircraft meanwhile the rest are found in the wings. As usual, they are all self-sealing fuel tanks. The Thunderstreak also has two armour plates; one 8 mm steel plate that covers most of the pilot from the rear and a small 12.7 mm steel plate that covers the pilot's head from behind. In addition, the front cockpit glass is 38 mm bulletproof glass with a 61° construction angle.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The F-84F is capable of high speeds for its Battle Rating, but takes a very long time to get there due to slow acceleration. Thus, the pilot generally must first climb in order to reach speeds similar to those of its opponents. Due to diverse ordnance options, it is useful as a Close Air Support jet in mixed battles, or to destroy ground/naval targets and bases in Air Battles. It can be used as a boom-and-zoom fighter, perhaps after first dropping ordnance, as its powerful engine provides good energy retention. Air spawn in Realistic Air battles provides the somewhat necessary advantage for this. Its guns will be familiar from other F-84 and F-86 models, and are reasonably effective if aimed properly. However, the F-84F is not a turnfighter by any means and is a cumbersome aircraft, especially at slow speeds.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The F-84F is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 4 nose-mounted .50 cals plus 2 near the side of the airframe making accurate shots possible
* 42 FFAR rockets making it great for pillbox hunting in Air Battles
* A lot of variety of ordnance for ground attack
* Gains a fair bit of speed in a dive
* All bombs can be dropped independently
* Sitting at rank V, it retains its airspawn in air realistic battles

'''Cons:'''

* Turning is below average so don't expect to last long in a turnfight with any aircraft
* While turning, speed is bled a lot so maintain your speed or choose carefully on what turn you make
* Will commonly face air-to-air missiles, many of which it can have difficulty evading
* Most jets will catch up to it due to poor acceleration
* The .50 cal MGs are underpowered for its rank
* The FFAR rockets are placed at the wingtips, which results in lower accuracy

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

=== [[wt:en/news/6990-development-f-84f-thunderstreak-en|Devblog]] ===
In the late 1940s, the manufacturer 'Republic' sought to improve the performance of the F-84 in order to bring it closer in line with the F-86 Sabre. As a result, it developed a new variant of the Thunderjet, designated F-84F. The new aircraft featured, among other changes, a new swept wing and a more powerful engine than its predecessor. Although Republic initially intended the new aircraft to be an extensive modernization of the base F-84, possessing a high degree of part compatibility with preceding variants, in the end, only less than 20% of the parts were interchangeable, resulting in the F-84F Thunderstreak becoming its own independent design.

Following its maiden flight in the early 1950s, the F-84F was ordered into production. However, the USAF focus on strategic bombers at the time resulted in some critical component manufacturing processes being prioritized for bomber production, ultimately leading to a staggered production start of the new F-84F.

The Thunderstreak officially entered service with the USAF in 1954, but was quickly phased out of active service due to engine issues before being reactivated in the early 1960s as tensions between the two superpowers began to rise again. Ultimately, the F-84F kept flying under American colors well into the early 1970s before finally being retired as newer aircraft replaced the Thunderstreak in active service.

The F-84F was also widely exported to NATO members. Chiefly among them were Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, China, the Netherlands as well as others. In total, well over 2,100 F-84F Thunderstreaks were built, with the Greek Air Force being the last to retire their F-84Fs in 1991.
