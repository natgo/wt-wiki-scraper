== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', known to ROCAF as the 雷霆式 (lit. the Thunderbolt type), was among one of the F-84G series delivered to ROCAF and also being the very last production straight wing F-84. These jets served ROCAF as the gap-filler before new jets were aided and during its 7 years of service, the G series scored a victory over MiGs which were considered to be undefeatable by F-84.

Introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], the jet is mostly identical to the [[F-84G-21-RE (China)|early series of F-84G]] in ROCAF service other than the delivery and its "block number" at 31; while it might not fit the name of being a fighter due to its conservative designs and underpowered engine (in terms of later jet engines), the air-to-ground ordinances for the jet is rather valuable to the Chinese tech tree which PLAAF happened to lack such jets at its tier. With the premium boost of the jet, players can train themselves for jet ground-attack operations without the assistance of ballistic computers for future jets while earning extra research points and silver lions.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Beginner-friendly centre-mounted machine guns with great trajectory, bullet velocity, and ammo count, unlike a [[MiG-15]]
* Has various bombs and rockets for ground attack
* Fast dive acceleration and speed
* Has a gyro gunsight

'''Cons:'''

* Poor turning ability and roll rate comparing to something like [[F-86A-5|F-86]]
* Bleeds speed severely when manoeuvring
* Machine guns lack damage, requiring prolonged hits on target
* Mediocre acceleration
* Long takeoff distance

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->'''See also: [[F-84G-21-RE (China)|F-84G-21-RE in ROCAF service]]'''

The delivery of this F-84G-31-RE was the No. 070 of the Thunder Tiger Aerobatics Team (雷虎特技小組) with a registration number of '''F-84070/52-8392''', due to the lack of further records of this batches of F-84G from both USAF and ROCAF, the fate of this jet is unknown; but likely been decommissioned and scrapped by the last user of this jet.<ref>https://rexkuang326.pixnet.net/blog/post/349307047 The only known image of 070's existence</ref>
