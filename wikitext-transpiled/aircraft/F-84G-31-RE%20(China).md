== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', known to ROCAF as the 雷霆式 (lit. the Thunderbolt type), was among one of the F-84G series delivered to ROCAF and also being the very last production straight wing F-84. These jets served ROCAF as the gap-filler before new jets were aided and during its 7 years of service, the G series scored a victory over MiGs which were considered to be undefeatable by F-84.

Introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], the jet is mostly identical to the [[F-84G-21-RE (China)|early series of F-84G]] in ROCAF service other than the delivery and its "block number" at 31; while it might not fit the name of being a fighter due to its conservative designs and underpowered engine (in terms of later jet engines), the air-to-ground ordinances for the jet is rather valuable to the Chinese tech tree which PLAAF happened to lack such jets at its tier. With the premium boost of the jet, players can train themselves for jet ground-attack operations without the assistance of ballistic computers for future jets while earning extra research points and silver lions.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Realistic Battle ===
Like many others in the game, this F-84 is a ground attack aircraft, with air respawn in realistic aerial matches and a series of weapons designed to perform this function.

=== Use of Weaponry ===

==== Nose Armament ====
The caliber of the nose weapons, the famous .50 M3 Browning, are very accurate and have a very high rate of fire with a considerable amount of ammunition. These characteristics make it considerably effective for air combat at his battle rate. However, when attacking land vehicles, it's important to note that the ammunition's penetration is not very effective. Even if it penetrates, it often doesn't cause significant damage to the vehicle's internal parts. This can be improved by using incendiary tracer ammunition. Even in Tank RB, I recommend always using tracer ammunition. It consists of incendiary rounds with 'ok' penetration for ground targets. The tracer ammunition can penetrate much of the engine protection of ground vehicles and cause fires, which can be devastating in War Thunder. 

Additionally, tracer ammunition performs well in dogfigths , aiding in aiming and causing fires in planes. It also has enough penetration to kill pilots in head-on engagements, even those with armored glass. Since we are discussing aerial combat, I recommend using short bursts instead of holding down the mouse button. Click as if you were using a semi-automatic weapon. Only fire a longer burst when you are sure you won't miss and want to deal significant damage at once. This will save ammunition and can often cause enough damage to take down the target with just a few shots, especially due to the chance of causing a fire.

==== Secondary Armament ====
In air matches, I recommend customizing your payload with 1000-pound bombs and HVARs mounted at the wingtips (located at hardpoints 1 and 8 as per the wiki). Once the match begins, ejecting the HVARs from the wings. While they are mainly there to remove the external fuel tank from the wings, the 24 HVAR pack significantly increases the plane's drag, affecting performance more than the 1000lbs bombs themselves. This could make it challenging for you to maneuver effectively in combat. Therefore, during aerial engagements, it's advisable to eject these rockets. Its recommend sticking with the 1000lbs bombs as they can help you earn extra points in matches without significantly affecting the plane's performance. Since you start the match flying at a considerable speed and altitude, the addition of these bombs should not pose a significant hindrance.

=== How and which bots to destroy in air RB ===
Although in tank mode machine guns cause little damage to player tanks, in aerial matches they can be very effective for ground attacks, especially if the player knows how to manage ammunition, choose targets, and attack them effectively. Here's how to attack them:

* '''Howitzer''':  Fire a short burst of 10 to 20 rounds directly at the cannon. If you hit it, it should be disabled. If you find it difficult to hit with a single burst, try firing 2 to 3 short bursts in succession. This may use up more ammunition, but it can be effective for neutralizing the target.
* '''Light Pillbox''': Try hitting them with bursts of up to 40 shots, aiming directly at the window if you're approaching from the front, or at the door if you're coming from behind. Light pillboxes can endure quite a bit of damage, but targeting these spots often leads to faster destruction, requiring less firepower.
* '''Pillbox''': If you don't have bombs, I suggest avoiding trying to destroy them.
* '''Patrol Boat''':  Try to fire a burst of about 50 shots at the bridges, if there are many of these vessels together consider dropping a 1000 pound bomb.
* '''BTR-152''': Fire short bursts of 10 to 20 shots at the front, directly over the engine. This can cause fires, and the bots in air mode never extinguish fires.
* '''AAA (no crew/module modeling)''':  With short bursts(10~20 rounds), you can destroy them from practically any distance, but be careful with the sandbags that may exist around them.
* '''PT-76-57''': Try hitting them with a short burst directly on the side, perpendicular to side of the tank, just below the turret, from a distance of max 800 m . With tracer ammunition, you can penetrate the armor, killing the gunner and commander and disabling the vehicle.
* '''Studebaker Trucks''': You have the option to shoot at the front of the vehicle, destroying the engine and causing fires from practically any distance you feel confident. Alternatively, you can try to kill the driver and the passenger, which will disable the vehicle.
* '''Medium/Heavy tanks(no crew/module modeling)''': It is recommended to skip these vehicles or reserve them for later. These vehicles can be destroyed with .50 caliber machine guns, but you need to be at a short distance, about 400m, for the shots to start causing damage. With a jet like the F-84, this will be difficult to control due to its considerable speed. Additionally, reducing your speed is not advisable because, as an older jet, it takes a long time to regain speed, leaving you exposed to enemy players who can easily destroy you.
* '''AAA truck(no crew/module modeling)''': They are very good targets to destroy. With short bursts(10~20 rounds), you can destroy them from practically any distance. Just be careful with the server's latency, as it can cause them to show strange zigzag movements.
* '''T-44-100''':  I suggest avoiding attempting to destroy this vehicle. It has more armor than the others mentioned, and even if you manage to set the engine on fire, you'll likely need to significantly reduce the plane's speed to make high-angled attacks to penetrate the armor above the motor. It simply isn't worth becoming such a vulnerable target. Another way is to use bombs.
* '''Air bots''': Planes don't have much mystery, but I recommend always trying to use short bursts to shoot them down.

=== Operational procedure on some aerial realistic maps ===
As already mentioned, it is a ground attack plane, and even with the upcoming [[Update "Seek & Destroy"|Seek and Destroy]] update, it will continue to have air respawn. However, since it is a BR 7.7 rank 5 aircraft, it will face several enemies and allies that are higher BR and rank 6. These higher-ranked ground attack aircraft will not have air respawn and will not perform much better. Therefore, this situation provides an excellent advantage for this F-84. You will be in a privileged position, allowing you to attack ground targets before your enemies even arrive in combat. This will provide you with RP points and a significant ticket advantage for your team, making it easier to farm with some peace of mind.

With 1800 incendiary tracer rounds of .50 caliber ammunition, you can allocate some for ground attacks and some for Air Combat. Initially, it may be difficult to manage this and execute effective ground attacks, as you will likely miss many shots. However, as you play, it will naturally become easier. Furthermore, with good performance, you can conduct effective aerial combat using just 400-500 rounds of .50 ammunition, and with good combat experience at this battle rating, you can take down 2 to 3 aircraft before reload.

And attention, its sugest the plane is configured with a payload of '''24x HVAR and 2x 1000lbs bombs and arround 11 min fuel'''. Additionally, note that the HVAR rockets are '''ejected right after respawn''' to maintain the plane's performance and remove the fuel tanks from the wingtips. You don't need to worry about fuel, as 11 minutes is usually enough to finish the match or even go back to airfield to reload your weapons. 

Speaking more about aerodromes, you will notice that on practically all the maps at his Battle Rate, your team will have two aerodromes: one with an improvised and shorter runway, which lacks anti-air defenses, and another with a longer runway equipped with extensive anti-air defenses provided by Rolands and some anti-air cannons. With the aforementioned configuration, this plane cannot take off from the short runway, so the game must respawn you flying after reloading, which can be an interesting advantage.

Additionally, note that on the long runway, you will need to use it almost entirely to take off, and on some maps, you will have to use a takeoff flap. Given all this, if you are safe, it is recommended to rearm on the short runway just to leave the aerodrome flying, without the need for a lengthy takeoff.

So simplifying everything above into points:

* '''Fuel Management''': 11 minutes of fuel is generally enough for your missions. Return to base if needed.
* '''Aerodrome Strategy''': Use the shorter runway for quick takeoffs when safe. Be aware that the longer runway offers better anti-air defense.
* '''Interception Awareness''': Always stay vigilant for enemy fighters, especially after completing ground attacks. Make quick decisions on whether to engage or evade based on your situational awareness.
* '''Thunderer Medal Strategy''': To secure the Thunderer medal, ensure you destroy the most ground targets on your team. Aim for 12 to 17 targets to be confident in achieving this.
