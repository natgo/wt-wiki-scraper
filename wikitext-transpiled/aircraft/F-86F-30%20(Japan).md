== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The F-86F-30 ("NA-191" as North American called it) was the first Sabre to be built with bombing in mind. Earlier Sabres had pitiful endurance when carrying bombs, which became an issue. This led to North American designing the NA-191, which had four hardpoints, either for more fuel or bombs. The combat range was greatly increased, which remedied the main issue of the Sabre's role as a fighter-bomber. The F-86F-30 would soon find a home in Japan. Although Japan was not allowed to have an air force after the war, Allied nations eased up on the restriction and allowed the Japan Air Self Defence Force in 1953. A year later, after the air force was established, they picked the F-86F to be their main fighter. 29 F-86F-25/30s were brought in from US surplus. Many early F-86Fs were brought up to the [[F-86F-40 (Japan)|F-40]] standard, which featured improved handling with leading-edge slats. 

Introduced in [[Update 1.39]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a fairly good fighter. Thanks to its sleek design and swept-wings, the F-86F-30 can reach speeds in excess of 1,100 km/h (683 mph). However, the J47 engine has relatively low thrust output, and it takes time to reach significant speeds. One of the main advantages of the F-86 Sabre is its impressive roll rate. Many aircraft at its battle rating will not be able to compete with it, especially MiG-15s. The F-86F-30 has the standard armament of six nose-mounted 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns, which have significant range but lack stopping power. This is one of the few downsides of the Sabre, but it is compensated for by the large ammunition pool. Overall, the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a powerful aircraft that can also be used as a fighter-bomber.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

While the F-86F-30's acceleration and top speed are lacking compared to its contemporaries, the F-86F-30's slats allow the plane to have an outstanding manoeuvrability. That said, one must beware of their speed as pulling high manoeuvres at high and max speed can put the plane under great stress which leads to the wings falling apart. The outstanding manoeuvrability comes at the cost of speed. Pulling hard turns will bleed your airspeed. Try to climb up before engaging the enemy to ensure you have enough energy to get out of a sticky situation. Hopefully, there will be a furball underneath you where you would be able to pounce on low-energy fighters with your guns. One advantage the F-86 has over the jets of other nations is the large ammo count of its 6 x .50 cals (1,800) although it would be wise to try and hit most of your shots. Try staying above 500 km/h as any slower and you would lose a significant amount of energy in a prolonged turn.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The F-86F-30 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great roll rate
* Retains energy well in turns and vertical manoeuvres 
* Decent turn time for jet
* Good acceleration
* Decent armament 12.7 mm M3 with a high rate of fire
* Can carry bombs or rockets
* Decent radar
* Clear cockpit view for simulator battle

'''Cons:'''

* Easy to rip off the wings with high-speed manoeuvres (realistic and simulator battles)
* This plane can match up against higher tier jets with afterburner and air-to-air missiles, like MiG-21s, Harriers, Su-25s, etc.
* Low ammo count equates to only 15-second burst

Following the Japanese defeat and the end of the Second World War, Japan was prohibited from maintaining armed forces of its own. Following the disbanding of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy in 1945, this decision was written into law in the 1947 Constitution. While the original article declared that Japan would never resort to war as an instrument to settle disputes and would never maintain land, sea or air forces or other instruments of war, later on the exact meaning of this article was questioned by successive governments as it meant Japan was fully dependent on the occupying Allied forces to come to its defence in case of an armed conflict. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 only furthered this concern, and a new interpretation of the constitutional article came into being: while Japan was prohibited from maintaining an offensive force, the article did not state that they were also prohibited from maintaining a purely defensive force.

The formal establishment of a mutual defence clause in the 1951 US-Japan Peace treaty led to the founding of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954, with the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force being its air component. As a result of negotiations concerning the founding of the JASDF, it was eventually decided that the new armed force would use the North American F-86F as its standard day-fighter, with license production being undertaken by Mitsubishi in the form of assembly of knock-down kits produced by the North American factory in California. However, as it would take time for production to start, the decision was taken to hand over USAF aircraft to the nascent JASDF pending the arrival of the first domestically-produced F-86Fs. This first delivery included 30 North American F-86F Sabres and 55 Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star jet-trainers.

The official handover of the first seven F-86Fs for the JASDF took place at Kisarazu Base on December 1st 1955; the last of the 30 aircraft was handed over four months later in April of 1956. This first tranche of 30 aircraft, consisting of 10 F-86F-25-NHs and 20 F-86F-30-NAs, was originally used as a stop-gap pending the delivery of the F-86F-40 variant intended for the JASDF. These aircraft served to equip the 1st Air Wing, which was officially declared operational on October 1st 1956. In the four years they served as daylight fighters, 2 aircraft were written off in accidents. As soon as sufficient North American and Mitsubishi-produced Block-40 aircraft became available, the 28 surviving F-86F-25s and -30s were put into storage.

This was not the end of their story, as 18 aircraft were converted to RF-86F reconnaissance aircraft in 1961. These aircraft were used to equip the 501st Squadron where they would have a surprisingly long career: the last of these RF-86Fs were only withdrawn from service in 1979.

The following F-86Fs were transferred from the USAF to the JASDF:

* F-86F-25-NH: 51-13361; 51-13368; 51-13369; 61-13376; 51-13385; 51-13390; 51-13414; 51-13474; 52-5327; 52-5439
* F-86F-30-NA: 52-4542; 52-4618; 52-4679; 52-4684; 52-4693; 52-4699; 52-4705; 52-4708; 52-4745; 52-4758; 52-4836; 52-4844; 52-4845; 52-4905; 52-4909; 52-4913; 52-4914; 52-4916; 52-4923; 52-4939

These aircraft were (randomly) renumbered in JASDF service as 52-7401/7409 and 62-7410/7430. Aircraft later converted to RF-86F standard were renumbered from the x2-74xx to x2-64xx.
