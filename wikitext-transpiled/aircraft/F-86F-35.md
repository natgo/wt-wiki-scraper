== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5924-development-shop-jet-packs-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/7417-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-in-gaijin-net-store-en|9th Anniversary Sale]]. It was briefly made available for purchase in the store during the [[wt:en/news/7765-special-us-independence-day-en|2022 "US Independence Day"]] mini-event.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} boasts of a excellent speed compared to its other counterparts, at least until the [[Shenyang F-5]], [[MiG-17AS]] and [[Hunter FGA.9]] were released as premium vehicles. This aircraft was one of the first Premium jets available for sale, therefore it is unable to carry either air-to-air or air-to-ground missiles. Retaking on speed, this aircraft is quite fast in a straight line but loses a lot of energy and speed especially when facing a turn. Therefore, if in a pursuit, a precise shot with the [[M3 Browning (12.7 mm)]], can wreak havoc on an enemy aircraft. However, these machine guns aren't so powerful in the jet age when compared to 20 mm cannons, emphasizing the importance of firing accurately and making every shot count.

This Sabre fighter is an aircraft with a very special camouflage which identifies it as one of the U.S. Air Force Skyblazers, a USAF acrobatic team. The aircraft then is great in manoeuvres at high speed, which makes it a good aircraft for air combat. You can also use it as well for ground attack if managing the 12 [[HVAR]] rockets it can carry. The only drawback to this manoeuvrability is that you lose quite a lot of speed in a turn. As well, the acceleration isn't great and makes the climb rate inferior to one of the other premium jets or other aircraft in its battle rating.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

[[File:F-86F-35 Armour layout.png|thumb|Armour layout of the F-86F-35]]
The F-86F-35 isn't very well protected, the armour may only stop small-calibre rounds and the engine and fuel tanks are exposed.

- 6.35 mm steel plate - Behind the instrument panel
- 6.35 mm steel plate (curved 29-57°) - Between the instrument panel and the windshield
- 38 mm bulletproof glass (58-60°) - Frontal windshield
- 20 mm steel plate - Pilot's head rest
- 12.7 mm steel plate - Behind the pilot's seat
- Self-sealing fuel tanks - In each wing, behind the pilot and under the engine

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|M3 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 6 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (300 rpg = 1,800 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|AN-M65A1 Fin M129 (1,000 lb)|HVAR}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 16 x HVAR rockets
- 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 Fin M129 bombs (2,000 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:F-86F-35 saori takabe 001.jpg|250px|thumb|right|F-86F-35 in the livery of the US Air Force Skyblazers aerobatic team, predecessors to the modern-day Thunderbirds.]]

The F-86F-35's acceleration and top speed are excellent compared to its contemporaries. Along with this the F-86F-35's slats allow the plane to have an outstanding manoeuvrability. That said, one must beware of their speed as pulling high manoeuvres at high and max speed can put the plane under great stress which leads to the wings falling apart. The outstanding manoeuvrability comes at the cost of speed. Pulling hard turns will bleed your air speed. Try to climb up before engaging the enemy to ensure you have enough energy to get out of a sticky situation. Hopefully, there will be a chaotic fight underneath you where you would be able to pounce on low-energy fighters with your guns. One advantage the F-86 has over the jets of other nations is the large ammo count of its 6 x 50 cals (1,800) although it would be wise to hit most of your shots. Try staying above 500 km/h as any slower and you would lose a significant amount of energy in a pro-longed turn.

=== Radars ===

<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->

The F-86F-35 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

[[File:F-86F-35 penthyn 001.png|250px|thumb|right|]]

'''Pros:'''

- Turns well at high speeds
- 6 x M3 Browning machine guns, if aimed well, can wreak havoc on nearly any aircraft
- Good dive characteristics
- High top speed for its BR; can outrun the MiG-15
- Decent acceleration

'''Cons:'''

- Poor low speed handling characteristics
- M3 machine guns' high fire rates can quickly use up your ammo
- M3 machine guns will not tear apart enemy aircraft as easily as the 23 mm cannons on the MiG-15
- Slower climb rate compared to the MiG-15
- Tends to quickly bleed off airspeed in a sustained turn

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The F-86 Sabre was designed by North American Aviation Company in the mid-late 1940s as an air superiority fighter, entering service in 1949 with the USAF. In 1950, it was deployed to Korea to combat the communist MiG-15s, and went on to score 560 kills to only 78 losses against the MiGs. Post-Korea, it went on to serve many other nations such as Pakistan, Taiwan, and Bolivia, the latter nation retiring its Sabres in 1994. Over 9,000 Sabres were built, including versions built in Canada and Australia, making the F-86 the most-produced Western fighter jet in military history.
