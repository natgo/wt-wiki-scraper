The F-86K Sabre (also known as "Sabre Dog" or "Dog Sabre") is a first-generation American interceptor fighter developed by North American in 1953. The first prototype, YF-86K, took to the skies on July 15, 1954. It was produced in the United States and Italy (at the Fiat factories), with 120 and 221 aircraft manufactured, respectively. Widely exported to NATO member countries as an interceptor, the aircraft was originally intended to be designated as the F-95A. However, the conclusion of the Korean War forced the designers to use the already well-established F-86 designation to secure funding from Congress. Nevertheless, only about 25% of the original F-86 components and assemblies remained in the F-86K. The aircraft underwent significant improvements in terms of armament and electronics, and it received a new engine equipped with an afterburner, which greatly enhanced its flight performance. The West German Luftwaffe would acquire 86 F-86K from the Fiat factories.

Introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]], the aircraft closely resembles the familiar F-86 Sabre, but the strengths of the original Sabre were further enhanced in the F-86K. The aircraft boasts better speed and altitude capabilities with its afterburning engine, powerful forward armament, high roll rate, and good horizontal maneuverability. However, like its predecessors, the "Sabre Dog" has a mediocre vertical maneuverability and wings that are somewhat susceptible to overloads. With only AIM-9B missiles available, the F-86K"s capability of reaching out towards the enemy is rather limited, but can help out in a pinch than just reliant on the aircraft's guns.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The F-86K is a decent aircraft at its BR. Unfortunately it rarely fights at its BR. When uptiered, which is most of the time, it is abysmal, being both slower and less manoeuvrable then the opposition. The F-86K has good low-end acceleration due to its afterburner, however, this aircraft is still only a subsonic fighter. Like every other jet, it's bad at manoeuvring at low speeds and its control surfaces compress at high speeds. However, the F-86K can handle top speed relatively well compared to other aircraft of its rank. If the F-86K can do one thing very well, it excels when going into vertical flight, which is only a factor when playing at its BR or lower, which is extremely rare.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The plane is equipped at the front with a 6.35 mm steel plate protecting the pilot's wrist and up. The cockpit's frontal glass is made of 38 mm of bulletproof glass that helps against incoming small calibre rounds. All the while the pilot's seat is made of 12.7 mm of steel which protects his back of any incoming small calibre rounds and shrapnel.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The F-86K should only be used as a support fighter, due to its sub-par manoeuvrability and relatively low top speed compared to other aircraft at its BR such as the MiG-17 at low speeds and the fact that it is most often up-tiered, in which case it is greatly outclassed. These flight performance issues mean the F-86K will not do well in 1 vs. 1 dogfight scenarios, except perhaps in downtiers when fighting against planes like the [[MiG-15bis]] and [[F-86A-5]] that the F-86K will be able to out-climb or out-run. However, more often than not the F-86K will be flying against F-105s, AV-8s, F-4s, and the like, to which the F-86K is highly vulnerable to and pose nearly no threat as they can either outrun or out-turn the F-86K, or both. As such it is recommended to work with teammates to help divert the enemy attention while dodging any incoming enemy attacks. With the help of allies, try and get the enemies into a vulnerable state that the F-86K can destroy when the opportunity presents itself.

When it comes to bomber hunting, this aircraft has four M24A1s, one of the few things that makes this aircraft somewhat playable. With this armament, head-on attacks are a viable option.  However, do not commit to head-ons, instead fire a burst from maybe .8 km out then pull out. This is to decrease the chances of both planes crashing and increasing the F-86K's chance of surviving. Be advised that early radar-guided missiles can be present and will negate the plane's head-on capability.


=== Radars ===

The F-86K is equipped with an [[AN/APS-21]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good top speed

In March 1949, the North American company launched the development of a new jet interceptor, based on the existing F-86 Sabre, as part of a private venture. The new design was the first interceptor developed to be operated by a single crew member and utilized unguided rockets in combination with a complex fire control system, rather than conventional guns, in order to destroy its target. Already by April, the project had received official endorsement from high-ranking military officials and development of a production version began in parallel.

While a production contract was signed in October, the first prototype, designated YF-95, conducted its maiden flight in December 1949. In the early '50s, Soviet nuclear testing and the subsequent start of the Korean conflict led to an accelerated development of the YF-95. Despite this, problems during development caused production to be delayed, resulting in the aircraft reaching its first units only in March 1951. During the delay however, the designation of the aircraft changed to F-86D and it received its unofficial nickname "Sabre Dog".

In January 1953, North American was approached by an offer from the Italian military to develop a twin-seater version of the F-86D armed with cannons. As the cost and necessary redesign work turned out to be too great, an agreement was made to produce the aircraft in its original design, but with cannon armament and a simplified fire control system instead. This new export version of the Sabre Dog received the new designation of F-86K.

Initially, the F-86K was produced exclusively in the U.S., but would later also be manufactured under licence by the Italian Fiat company. The F-86 entered service in 1955 and apart from the West German's Air Force, the F-86K also served with many other operators worldwide including France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Honduras, Venezuela. Around 340 F-86Ks were produced out of over 2,800 Sabre Dogs built in total. Most of the F-86Ks would be decommissioned by the late '60s, while some even went on to serve into the '70s.
