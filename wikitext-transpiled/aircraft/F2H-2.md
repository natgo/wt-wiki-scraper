== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.45 "Steel Generals"]]. The F2H-2 Banshee is a fantastic jet-fighter with great overall speed and good manoeuvrability. It is most recognized for its ability to remain stable even past its speed limit break (933 km/h or 580 mph) and also for its fantastic high-altitude performance.

The Banshee is a very stable platform at high speeds. Speed warning appears at 940 km/h (584 mph), but it can reach over a 1,000 km/h (621 mph) and still not rip apart if flown carefully and kept it in a straight line.

Overall this jet is one of the best US early jets, its BR coupled with its very good performances make it a very pleasant aircraft to fly and grind the whole US air tree.

The aircraft is very powerful and even if one of the engines is taken out, the machine can still return to base safely.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The F2H-2 Banshee is a carrier-based jet fighter aircraft. The plane is powered by the Westinghouse J34-WE-34 engine, the same that can be found in the F3D-1, although it is over 90 km/h faster than the former in level flight at sea level, it can reach 933 km/h. The Banshee is significantly faster than the F-80C and slower than jets from other nations, the Yak-30, M.D.452, J29 or export versions of the F-84G, also the structural speed which is 994 km/h is lower than their maximum level speed, so it can struggle with catching up to them.
Its level acceleration is decent, it varies a lot on the fuel amount since the plane carries a lot of it and when there is 30 minutes or less left it is very comparable to jets at similar battle rating, but any F-86 or MiG-15 version will easily outperform it. When it comes to climbing it can start struggling against any other planes, when the plane is fully loaded it is only 27 m/s and increases to ~37 m/s when there is only 20 minutes (30%) of fuel left.
The F2H can fly for around 30 minutes at 100% of power, then it can start to overheat. There is no time limit for flying at 94%.

The manoeuvrability is also decent: at low and medium speed it can give a hard time to jets with swept wings and some other like the F-84G, performing a full horizontal circle will take 25 seconds at 1000 m with full fuel tanks and around 20 seconds with 20 minutes of fuel. The flaps also can decrease the turn time by 20% but their drawback is their quite low speed limit. The plane will suffer from high speed compressibility near 1000 km/h IAS. Since it is a carrier-based jet, its stall speed is low: it varies from 185 to 205 km/h IAS, depending on the weight.
The positive and negative G limit for wings are very low, the plane can suffer from wing failure after reaching close to 9G with full loadout. When rolling, it can reach up to 100 degrees per second at 600 km/h IAS and it is mediocre below 300 km/h IAS, 50 degrees per second and lower. The Banshee has also access to airbrakes which can help during landing or in combat situations to slow down the plane.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

''Compressor'' and ''Engine'' are always useful upgrades and all acceleration unlocks are a top priority. Given the ''uniqueness'' of the AN/M3 armament ''New 20 mm cannons'' and ''[[G-Suit]]'' should be preferable tier 4 goals. The stock belts are better than any other type of ammo, due to more two times more HEFI-T inside of them, but for the improved cannons, they need to be researched, albeit that can wait past the G-Suit. To help with the manoeuvrability issues, boosters should be considered a priority as well.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Banshee is first in the US naval jet lineup and possesses many characteristics that make it a fantastic start for jet players.

Some tips to use it effectively are:

*Staying at a high altitude (side-climbing)
*Avoiding/evading higher-flying prop and jet planes (Stay aware of your surroundings and watch for enemy fighters)
*Using Boom & Zoom or Hit & Run tactics

In AB, the F2H is actually quite mediocre. Its high BR makes it liable to be put with superior jets such as the Me-262 (which has unlimited fuel, as is characteristic of AB) or the F-86 Sabre.

AB will initially be frustrating as the un-upgraded Banshee is a very poor performer. Its cannons jam, it has a relatively poor climb rate, and acceleration is poor as well.

Once upgraded, however, the Banshee can be a very effective and useful plane.

The F2H-2 is most effectively used as an energy fighter. It has great energy retention, turns well, and accelerates quite well once fully researched. However, the stock Banshee is terrible compared to super-props such as the [[Tempest Mk II]], [[F8F-1B]], [[La-9]], and others. Therefore, it is recommended to climb at the beginning of a match to at least 4-6 km as the Banshee performs extremely well at these altitudes. However, keep in mind that evasion of superior planes such as the F8F-1B or the [[MiG-15]] is key. Once optimal altitude is reached, Boom & Zoom can be employed. The F2H has sluggish controls at speeds below 482 km/h (300 mph) so try to maintain above that speed in level flight. But when facing super-props, low-speed stability coupled with an airbrake makes the Banshee an extremely good prop-killer. If you maintain a high speed during combat, you can outrun most jets at your [[Battle ratings|Battle Rating]].

If you are unlucky, you will face the [[F-86A-5|F-86A]] and [[MiG-15]] in some battles, be sure to avoid them at all costs as they climb far better than the Banshee and have superior top speed.

Unfortunately, like most other jets, modifications take a long while to grind. Go for anything that increases the Banshee's climb rate. Leave the cannon ammo belts alone because default has the most HE shells (besides Stealth), and research the ''New Cannons'' modification; It will markedly improve the terrible spread of the cannon.

The cockpit of the F2H-2 is fantastic- the bubble canopy provides good visibility to the front and back of the aircraft.

Even with good advantages as a starting jet fighter (if you went with the Naval Line of USA Fighters), it has some disadvantages going up against MiG-15's and MiG-17's. It can certainly outrun La-174's and La-15's with splendid ease, but it will never be able to outrun a MiG once it's on your tail. As for MiG-9's, they can't outrun the Banshee but can probably out-turn it if the MiG-9 pilot is properly trained and experienced.

It's best used as a support fighter in EVERY situation unless you are down-tiered and you are put against Ho-229's and Me-262's. In this case, you can become an aggressive fighter and easily score some kills. Although if you are put up against MiG-17's, MiG-15's and La-15's, best prepare yourself to side-climb and get behind your allies. Get some altitude and be patient to pursue MiG's that are either chasing Hunters or Sabres or an unfortunate bomber.

A good recommendation is that you should never go for [[IL-28|IL-28s]] alone. Other recommendations are that you should never take rockets or bombs unless you're in a squad and you bomb points together. It is NOT recommended either way. Another tip is to try holding your speed and use airbrakes when being tailed by a MiG.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The F2H-2 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

The twin-engine F2H Banshee was a follow up to McDonnell's successful FH-1 Phantom and was designed to become the Navy's next carrier-borne aircraft. The two aircraft appear very similar but the F2H was improved in several ways. Primary upgrades include larger airframe, heavier armament, and better power-plants. Nearly 800 Banshees were built for the Navy and Marine Corps during the early 1950s.

The Banshee saw use in Korea with the Navy and Marines escorting Air Force B-29s on bombing missions but would never encounter an enemy fighter throughout the whole war. As a fighter/bomber, the Banshee saw limited use, but the greatest role the F2H performed in the war was doing reconnaissance over hostile territory. A majority of the F2H's service took place in the Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans but its appeal came from its ability to go unnoticed by enemy forces and would primarily serve recon or escort purposes. The Navy and Marine Corps would retire the Banshee from active service around the early 1960s and would replace it with aircraft such as the F9F Cougar, F3H Demon, and the F4D Skyray. In the 1950s several refurbished Banshees were purchased by the Canadian government where they saw limited service on the HMCS ''Bonaventure'' until the early 1960s when they were finally retired from military service.
