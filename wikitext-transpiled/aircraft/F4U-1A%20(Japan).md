* 38 mm bulletproof glass

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 6 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (400 rpg inner + centre + 375 rpg outer = 2,350 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Players should side climb in this plane and once at altitude, begin to dive down on enemies below. Due to the weight and aerodynamics of this aircraft, it is a fantastic Boom & Zoomer for the battle rating. With enough energy, no other comparable aircraft can catch it in a dive. When you have speed at your disposal, you can easily energy fight against higher-rank aircraft. Be aware that over speeds of approximately 550km/h the rudder is almost useless and if the target evades you it will be almost impossible to hit them. Using the aircraft's great flaps and energy retention allow the fighter to hang in the vertical much longer than other planes; it's here you can corner enemies into an energy trap. However, those who wish to take on the {{Specs|name}} in combat must make sure they go into the engagement with a significant energy advantage over your opponent or you may find yourself on the receiving end of a lead shower.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list.

'''Pros:'''

* Heavy armament of 6 x 12.7 mm machine guns
* Fantastic energy retention
* Extremely fast dive speed

'''Cons:'''

* Poor manoeuvrability for a fighter (heavy aircraft)
* No payload options

== History ==

Vought F4U-1A Corsair single-engine carrier-based fighter (IJNAF)

A single-seat, single-engine carrier-based fighter; an all-metal cantilever monoplane with a peculiar inverted gull wing. It was designed in the design bureau of Chance Vought for a single-seat carrier-based fighter competition announced by the USNAF. The V-166B prototype fighter made its first flight on May 26, 1940. In June 1942, the F4U fighter entered mass production.

In the middle of 1943, the F4U-1A variant began full-scale production. While creating this variant, Chance Vought's experts introduced some changes into the aircraft's design which contributed to its success as a carrier-based fighter.

The main landing gear shock absorbers' stroke was increased, and their stiffness was reduced. The pilot's cockpit was drastically redesigned; to improve forward and rear visibility, which was especially important when landing on an aircraft carrier, the pilot's cockpit canopy was made convex, and the pilot's seat was raised 17.8 cm.

The designers solved the problem of the fighter's stalling at near-minimum speeds in quite a simple way: a stall strip, 152 mm long, was fitted on the right wing in the area of the machine gun ports. When the left wing began to stall, which was typical of the F4U-1, this strip initiated flow separation over the right wing, leveling the aircraft out.

The F4U-1A's armament consisted of six large-calibre 12.7 mm Colt-Browning ANM2.5 machine guns, three on each wing.

The Corsair fighters were quite dangerous opponents for the Japanese fighters, so the Imperial Japanese Navy's experts wanted to take a closer look at the new American machine.

The Japanese managed to capture two Corsair fighters which had made forced landings. One of them was an F4U-1A, and the planes had apparently belonged to the US Marine Corps and the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

The Japanese successfully repaired one machine, using the second F4U as a source of spare parts and partially covering the damaged parts of the wing surfaces with canvas. This restored Corsair was flight-tested. After Japan surrendered, this machine was discovered by the Americans at the flying school airfield in Kasumigaura.
