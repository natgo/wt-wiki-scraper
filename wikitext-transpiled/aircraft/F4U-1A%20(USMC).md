== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American naval fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.39]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 3 mm steel - above front fuel tank
- 8 mm steel - behind pilot's body
- 12.7 mm steel - behind pilot's head
- 38 mm bulletproof glass - armoured windscreen

{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 6 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (375 rpg outer + 400 rpg centre + inner = 2,350 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Due to its great energy retention and high dive speed, the Corsair is very good at Boom and Zooming. It is recommended to be used this way, especially against any Japanese planes. Against any German planes BnZ is still recommended, but some planes you can out turn ([[Fw 190 A-4]]). As with every American fighter, always climb at the start of a match. The only way to be successful with this plane is to climb high and end up higher than the enemy. Using this tactic will greatly increase your chances of getting the enemy and forcing the enemy down low where you can finish them off.

The removal of the carrier landing equipment lightened the {{PAGENAME}} by a few hundred kilograms compared to the original F4U-1A, resulting in a better climb rate and slight advantage in manoeuvrability. This positively affects both the vertical and the horizontal manoeuvres along with providing slightly faster acceleration and a minor edge with its maximum speed.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Great diving characteristics
- Good energy retention
- Great speed
- Better performance than its original counterpart
- Good climb rate
- Great high-speed manoeuvrability
- Great armament

'''Cons:'''

- Can't land on carriers, lack of arrestor hook

- Big target, easy to hit
- Weak damage model

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The single-engine Chance Vought F4U Corsair was designed in 1938 for a U.S. Navy single-seater carrier-based fighter competition. This aircraft was designed from the outset as a carrier borne fighter. It featured an inverted gull wing to keep the huge propeller off the ground while keeping the landing gear short for carrier operations. Even after the completion and launch of the F4U-1, a number of problems were discovered which initially prevented the aircraft from being used as a carrier-based fighter such as bad stall characteristics due to the gull wing, no visibility over the nose for carrier landings and bouncing off the deck after landing. The Navy was forced to use the first F4U-1s for Marine Corps ground-based operations until January 1945 when most of these problems were overcome.

In the middle of 1943, the F4U-1A variant made its debut. To improve visibility, which was especially important when landing on an aircraft carrier, the cockpit canopy was modified to a convex shape, and the pilot's seat was raised 17.8 cm. Dive speed problems were solved with a stall strip just outboard of the gun ports on the starboard wing's leading edge.

The F4U-1A was produced not only at the Chance Vought factory, where the aircraft was designed but also at the Brewster and Goodyear factories (with the designations F3A-1A and FG-1A, respectively). The latter model differed in that its wings could not fold. The Chance Vought factory produced a total of 2,126 F4U-1As.
