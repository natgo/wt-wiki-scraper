== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French naval fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 38 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit front.
- 3 mm Steel plates in front of the cockpit, top of the fuselage.
- 8 mm Steel plate behind the pilot.
- 12.7 mm Steel plate on the headrest.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|M3 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm M3 cannons, wing-mounted (246 rpg = 984 total)

The four cannons are arranged in bundles of two mounted in each wing. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|No.1 (100 kg)|AN-M57 (250 lb)|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)}}
{{main|HVAR|SNEB type 23|T10 140|T10 151}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 10 x 100 kg No.1 bombs (1,000 kg total)
- 10 x 250 lb AN-M57 bombs (2,500 lb total)
- 4 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (2,000 lb total)
- 3 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (3,000 lb total)
- 10 x HVAR rockets
- 10 x T10 140 rockets
- 10 x T10 151 rockets
- 114 x SNEB type 23 rockets

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

- Play it as a pure fighter, no payload, with the powerful 4 x 20 mm AN/M3 guns there is no need to spray the enemy aircraft with ammunition, just one hit will severely damage the enemy fighter to include a potential loss of control systems, fire or multiple leaks, if you're facing attackers or heavy bombers (especially the [[He 177 A-5]]), you must keep your distance because the F4U-7 is a fragile aircraft, engage them from far or attack them par surprise. Use this aircraft as a boom and zoomer.
- Play it as an attacker, use the famous 114 x SNEB rocket payload. This payload is the best for the Enduring Confrontation. There is enough firepower to eliminate all the enemies on the battlefield with careful aim. And a convoy is just a piece of cake. For the tanks, send six rockets, two for howitzer and two to four rockets for a pillbox. When you run out of rockets, you have two choices:
  _# Return to the airfield to reload
  _# Use it as a fighter, but you'll be turning 2.7s slower, select those fighters which have a poorer turning radius.
- Fly the aircraft as a fighter/bomber, take the payload with the 3 x 1,000 lbs bombs and attack the bases. Once you're out of bombs, you can dogfight other planes.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Better high altitude performance than [[F4U-4B]]
- Excellent armament when fully upgraded, high ammo count
- 114 x SNEB rockets are devastating against both ground and air targets

'''Cons:'''

- Painful to play when stock
- Relatively bad climb rate
- Limited WEP (11 minutes)
- Fragile tail section
- Extremely inaccurate guns when stock
- Performs poorly with added weight from suspended armaments

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The French Navy (Aéronavale) desperately needed a carrier-born aircraft for their newly acquired carriers from the U.S. and Britain. The U.S. decided to help France by making the F4U-7. The F4U-7 was essentially the AU-1 Corsair and F4U-4 Corsair mixed together. It combined the engine from the F4U-4 and airframe, but it also had the payload capacity of the AU-1 Corsair. This allowed it to be powerful against fighters but also effective against ground targets. The U.S. actually bought the F4U-7s first, then through MAP (Military Assistance Program), France received them.

In 1956, due to the inaccuracy of free-fall bombs and unguided rockets, France experimented with the F4U-7 in its ability to carry [[SS-11]] guided missiles. France couldn't afford sortie after sortie with a shortage of pilots, so the only way to combat that was to make weapons more accurate. Use of the SS.11 on the F4U-7 required intense training as there would be 2 sticks, one to fly the plane and one to guide the missile to its target. This required the pilot to have "2 brains" as you would have to fly while watching the ATGM. France found it to be a success, so they decided to select a squadron to start the process on, but however, they decided to not pursue it. France couldn't take 15 Corsairs at a time to be fitted with ATGMs due to their small fleet of only around 115 F4U-7s. However, the idea did live on with the MD.311 Flamant.
