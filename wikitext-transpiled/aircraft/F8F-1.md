== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American naval fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.33]].

The F8F-1 is an all-purpose light fighter-bomber, and excels as such. Although it may seemed incredibly outgunned with only four M2 Brownings, the Bearcat can be a more than decent fighter in the right hands. The plane was developed to achieve two things: the best possible climb rate and the ability to land on escort carriers.

The in-game F8F-1 retains many advantages of the real-life counterpart. The F8F has very good acceleration and climb rate, thanks to its powerful engine. Because of that, it can quickly gain an altitude advantage over its opponents. Thanks to its high top speed, good wing endurance, and good energy retention capabilities, the F8F is perfectly suited to energy fighting. A Bearcat pilot should avoid low-speed dogfights, instead opt for a diving attack from above.The Bearcat is also a very hardy aircraft able to sustain several hits from enemy cannon and machine gun rounds before being decommissioned. The phrase "Grumman Ironworks" comes into play on the Bearcats just like their previous works; The F3F, The F4F ''Wild Cat'', and the F6F ''Hellcat''. Therefore you shouldn't be too wary of 13-15 mm. 20 mm Hispanos and 30 mm Rhein Borsig series guns are your biggest threats in terms of damage.

The main issue with the F8F-1 is its armament. With only four 12.7 mm M2 machine guns, the F8F-1 is lacking especially when compared to the succeeding F8F-1B that has four 20 mm M3 autocannons. With a relatively low fire rate and low damage, pilots must make their shots count. Unlike most other planes equipped with the M2 Brownings, the Bearcat can utilize M20 API-T rounds. These rounds excel at setting targets aflame. Precise aiming is key, specifically targeting the enemy aircraft's engine or pilot. Aiming for the fuselage is less effective as unlike the P-47D, which has eight M2s which can chew through aircraft fuselages by hurling twice as many bullets down range. Meanwhile the measly 4 x M2s Bearcat will pepper the hull and simply be absorbed. And unlike other Browning armed airplanes, it has mediocre ammo load of only 1250 rounds.

Make use of the secondary payloads as well. The Bearcat can make use of the Tiny Tim rockets as well as a large array of HVAR rockets and bombs. Tiny Tims are especially useful against heavy ground targets and tanks.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 8.5 mm Steel - Under cowling engine armour plate
- 8.5 mm Steel - Fore cockpit protection plate
- 9.5 mm Steel - Pilots seat and headrest
- 60 mm Bulletproof glass - Windshield

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

- The "holy trinity" of flight performance upgrades: Compressor, Engine, and Engine injection. All three combined increase climb rate by 10 m/s (~2,000 feet/min)
- Armament upgrades are worth considering due to lacking armament, bad stock belts and mediocre ammo count
- G-suit is very useful, given the plane is most manoeuvrable at medium to high speeds

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (300 + 325 rpg each wing = 1,250 total)

The M2 Browning machine gun by this rank is a very familiar machine gun to most American players. The usage of the M20 API-T rounds in the belts available makes the {{PAGENAME}} able to dish out similar damages to that of other Rank III-IV fighters with the M2 Browning armaments.

However, the mounting of the armaments on the {{PAGENAME}} has some downsides. The {{PAGENAME}} only comes with four machine gun totals, two per wing, compared to the usual six machine guns in American fighters. Not only that, the {{PAGENAME}} guns come with less rounds per gun in the wing. This means the {{PAGENAME}} overall loses out in firepower and firing time available with the click of the trigger.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)|HVAR|Tiny Tim|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 4 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (gunpods) (340 rpg = 1,360 total)
- 2 x Tiny Tim rockets
- 4 x HVAR rockets
- 1 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bomb + 4 x HVAR rockets (1,000 lb total)
- 1 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bomb (1,000 lb total)
- 1 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bomb + 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (2,000 lb total)
- 3 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (3,000 lb total)

In modes outside of Arcade Battles, the F8F-1 releases some suspended armaments in pairs rather than singular. The Tiny Tim rockets are both fired at the same time, so the pilot will only have one chance to hit the target. In configurations with multiple bombs, the wing-mounted bombs drop off first before the fuselage-mounted bomb.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:FighterImage_F8F1.jpg|thumbnail|left|A Bearcat dives towards a formation of [[Kikka]] fighter-bombers.]]
This aircraft is best when used as an energy fighter; however, unlike other American planes, it doesn't fulfil the Boom-and-Zoom role very well because of lacking armament and rudder lock-up above 720 km/h.

Originally designed to achieve best possible climb rate, this aircraft sacrifices almost everything else, including armament, supercharger, fuel load and radiator. However, as it was also made to be able to use escort carriers, it is also small and durable.

This aircraft has great climb rate in Air Realistic Battles (spaded and with minimum fuel) as well as great acceleration; these two traits should be used accordingly for the plane's best performance. At the beginning of the match, climb into the battlefield, and attack the opponents with the highest energy. If there is an enemy above you, disengage using your great acceleration. Do not be afraid to attack lower enemies, as this plane's optimal altitude is below 1,000 m. It is also quite fast in a straight line, especially on low altitudes.

The bad low speed manoeuvrability isn't really an issue given the plane's acceleration.

- Although the name "Ovencat" may not sound encouragingly, MEC lets pilot completely forget about the overheating problem. Set the prop pitch to 100%, Mixer to ~95%. Change supercharger gear around 1,100 m. Manage radiators according to the temperatures.

=== Pros and cons ===

The first idea for the creation of the Grumman F8F Bearcat was pitched after the Battle of Midway. Many pilots who took part in it remarked that one of the most important parts of naval air warfare was an aircraft's rate of climb. This of course meant that an increase in power was necessary. In 1943 the design work on the new aircraft began. The outline called for a fighter-interceptor, capable of operating even from small escort carriers. While the engine – the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial – was the same model used on the earlier [[F6F-5|F6F Hellcat]], the new fighter would be lighter which also meant an increase in speed and climb rate. The concession was limiting the range of the new aircraft. The F8F would also feature a bubble canopy for better all around visibility. The first prototype, the XF8F-1, first took to the skies on the 21st August 1944. Further tests proved the aircraft's reliability and ruggedness, and the F8F was accepted into mass production. The first serial models rolled off the assembly line in February 1945 and were delivered to VF-19 fighter squadron, which began operating flights with the Bearcats in May 1945.

The new fighter, was, however, too late for any combat in World War II. After the war the situation of this propeller aircraft got even more complicated thanks to the introduction of naval jet aircraft. Even though the F8F was one of the fastest propeller-driven aircraft of its time, it was clear that the jet age was dawning. The F8F was replaced in US Navy and USMC service by the F9F Panther and the [[F2H-2|F2H Banshee]] jet aircraft. Some Bearcats saw combat service with the French in French Indochina in 1951, when they were used in the CAS role against the Viet Minh troops. Thailand also received a shipment of Bearcats which were then operated by the Thai Air Force. The F8F found a new life – thanks to its speed and acceleration - it was and still is widely used as a racing aircraft. One of the most famous racing Bearcats is the Rare Bear – a specially modified F8F, which holds many propeller aircraft speed and climb records.
