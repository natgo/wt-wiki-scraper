== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American naval jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.37]].

The Panther will typically find itself outclassed as it often faces against more advanced jet designs, such as the [[MiG-15]] or [[Venom FB.4|Venom]]. However, it does excel in a support fighter role. Distracted opponents are easy prey when the Panther's high-speed driving and manoeuvrability are applied correctly. When engaged 1 on 1 with other jet fighters, its flaws (low top speed) can be exposed. Defensively, the Panther has an uncanny ability to escape pursuing enemies when using its agility to your advantage. The Panther greatly excels at the Fighter-bomber role due to its optional payloads.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 9.5 mm Steel - Fore cockpit armour plate
* 9.5 mm Steel - Armour plate behind pilot's seat
* 60 mm Bulletproof Glass - Windshield

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The primary modules that will need to be unlocked are flight performance, handling (''New boosters''), and ''Offensive 20 mm'' belts. After unlocking these high priority improvements, then the focus is secondary weaponry. Without the ''New 20 mm Cannons'' module the plane tends to have a high spread when firing its primary armament.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm M3 cannons, nose-mounted (190 rpg = 760 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The F9F-2 is best described as a support fighter. It is often outclassed by more powerful enemies such as the [[MiG-15]], but as a support to allies, it shines nonetheless. In this play-style, the Panther can leverage its desirable dive characteristics to prey on distracted opponents. A Panther pilot may often find themselves with an enemy on their six. In such a defensive situation, the F9F-2 provides an excellent roll rate with which to dodge enemy fire. However, to dispatch the opponent, it is often necessary to employ the help of teammates.

The Panther has a wide selection of ground-attack ordnance options and can use either bombs or rockets to destroy ground targets very effectively in ground realistic battles. In air battles, the Panther is in almost all cases better suited for an air-to-air role, but even when ordnance is not mounted, the internal 20 mm cannons are able to destroy lightly armoured ground targets. When using HVAR rockets, the aim is especially important, as the six rockets are fired in pairs. With only three shots, it is important to maximize the rockets' effectiveness by aiming slightly to the side of the target. Since the rockets are wing-mounted, this will result in one of them hitting the target directly and causing the maximum possible damage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent manoeuvrability at higher speeds
* Excellent roll rate
* Decent suspended armament
* Good low altitude performance
* Powerful armament with a high rate of fire
* High ammo capacity
* Large fuel capacity in comparison with other fighter jets

'''Cons:'''

* Poor high altitude performance
* Poor low-speed manoeuvrability
* Poor top speed
* Very fragile tail
* WEP runs out very quickly
* Battle rating puts the Panther against planes like the [[MiG-15bis]], the [[MiG-17 (Family)|MiG-17]] and the [[Hunter (Family)|Hawker Hunter]], all of which outperform it
* Cannons are horribly inaccurate when stock

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The Panther was born during a time when the jet engine was beginning to make its appearance into service. The United States Navy commissioned a jet-powered fighter for its carrier decks. Grumman began work on the XF9F-1 Prototype (Grumman designation G75). The airframe would carry two crewmen and implement four turbojet engines. At the time, four of them were planned to be used due to the low power output by early turbojet engines. This ran into several issues including taking up too much space on American carriers. Eventually, the design was dropped in favour of the XF9F-2 prototype, Grumman's Model G79, that utilized 1 crew member and eventually a single-engine. The British Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine was used for basic testing. Pratt & Whitney were eventually able to produce the engine and it was designated "J42". As the Panther moved along the creation process, items like wingtip fuel tanks were added to increase its range. Carrier trials with the prototypes were completed in March of 1949. The F9F-2 entered US Navy service in May of 1949.

The F9F-2 is the first production variant of the Panther. It is powered by a Pratt & Whitney J42-P-8, a license-built version of the Rolls Royce Nene engine. The F9F-2B was a new variant of the F9F-2 which allowed it to carry 2,000 lbs of ordnance under its wings. Once all F9F-2s were upgraded to the B standard, the B designation was dropped and the aircraft was simply referred to as F9F-2.

The Panther entered combat during the Korean War. It was the primary jet fighter used by the U.S. Navy and Marines. It played a significant part in the ground attack role and flew over 78,000 sorties. It secured the first U.S. Naval air to air kill against a Yak-9. Famous F9F pilots included astronaut John Glenn and Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams. Panthers were pulled from front-line service in 1956 in favour of the swept-wing "Cougar". F9F Panther was the first jet used with the US Navy's Blue Angels aerobatic team.
