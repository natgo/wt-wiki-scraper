== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]]. 

Starting in 1946, the Netherlands Naval Aviation Service (MLD) purchased a large group of surplus Fairey Firefly aircraft from Britain for operations off of the aircraft carrier HNLMS Karel Doorman (R81). The MLD primarily deployed their Firefly squadrons in the Dutch East Indies to perform ground attack missions against Indonesian forces in the 1950s to 1960s. This aircraft's camouflage represents Firefly F.Mk.IV '16-44' of VSQ-7 of the Royal Netherlands Navy. 

Players who have flown this aircraft in the British tech tree will be familiar with this variant. The Dutch Firefly F.Mk.IV is a stable and competent ground striker with its decent cannons and secondary weapons. It is recommended to perform ground strikes against targets in areas that have established air superiority, as enemy fighters will often be able to catch up to and out maneuver the Firefly F.Mk.IV.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
