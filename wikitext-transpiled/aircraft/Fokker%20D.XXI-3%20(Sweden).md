== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was designed by the Netherlands in 1935. It was meant to be a cheap and compact fighter, it served for both the ''Luchtvaartafdeling'' (Dutch Army Aviation Group) and the Finnish Air Force, some aircraft captured by Germany were actually placed in service with the Luftwaffe. The Fokker D.XXI was first used in combat by the Finnish Air Force during the 1939–1940 Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland. The '''D.XXI-3''' was a license built D.XXI-2 for Finland. The aircraft used the normal armament but was eventually fitted with 20 mm cannons. Against the Soviet Union, the aircraft was initially successful, but eventually it became underpowered and sustained heavy losses. During the Continuation War, the Fokker was surprisingly effective, with some Finnish pilots even becoming ace fighters on it with the top scoring ace being Jorma Sarvanto. Finland continued to operate their D.XXIs until 1949, and classified them as surplus to requirements in 1952.

It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a slow, although very agile fighter. It could be compared to fighters like the I-16 that are excellent dogfighters but lack the engine power of other aircraft like the Bf 109. It has a capable offensive armament for its BR, with 4 x light machine guns, it's enough to destroy most biplanes, however, more advanced fighters would be more tricky to destroy. Even though it's a slow fighter, it does have a high climb rate, so try climbing to a good altitude since the start of the match, 4,000-5,000 m would be a good idea. It is also particularly stable in simulator battles so it's a beginner friendly aircraft. For its survivability, the aircraft has only a single fuel tank, so a leak would eventually result in the aircraft losing all the fuel, and a fire in that tank would also cause the aircraft to get destroyed. In low-level flight, the aircraft is very slow, and most fighters would catch up to you if you try to retreat.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Fokker D.XXI-3 is highly agile for its class, and many opponents (except biplanes) will often struggle to get a good shot. The downside to its manoeuvrability is its speed. The Fokker D.XXI-3 is quite primitive, with only landing flaps, and fixed landing gear causing considerable drag. This makes the Fokker D.XXI-3 unable to run away from most opponents, as even some biplanes are capable of catching up. This doesn't mean the plane is weak however, as the engine provides excellent power for such a light machine, allowing it to climb high above most targets.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* Armour: one 9 mm steel plate behind pilot's seat
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 in front of pilot)

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FN-Browning M.36 No.3 (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.7 mm FN-Browning M.36 No.3 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)
* 2 x 7.7 mm FN-Browning M.36 No.3 machine guns, wing-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In dogfights, use your superior turn time to get an advantage over opponents. Keep your speed above 170 k/h while dogfighting to avoid becoming sluggish. Having a good altitude advantage is a must as this will grant your plane more energy before entering a fight.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* High climb rate, especially for a monoplane of this BR
* Only one fuel tank, so fires usually would not be started if the aircraft was tailed
* Great turn time
* Engine takes a while to overheat on WEP
* Sturdy airframe tolerates high speed dives
* Very stable aircraft to fly in simulator battles
* Fixed landing gear makes landings easier and more simplified
* Good armament for its BR

'''Cons:'''

* Rather slow, cannot escape fights
* Only has landing flaps
* No armour
