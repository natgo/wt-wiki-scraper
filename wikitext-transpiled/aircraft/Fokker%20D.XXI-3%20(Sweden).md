== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. Apart from the armament and a bit of armour behind the pilot, it is broadly similar to the premium [[Fokker D.XXI|D.XXI]]: primitive but rugged, slow but very manoeuvrable. The loss in punch of its offensive armament (four 7.7 mm Brownings instead of the two 7.7 mm and two 20 mm cannon in the premium version) is partially offset by the lower BR. Even stock, the engine can be run at WEP for extended periods of time without overheating.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Fokker D.XXI-3 is highly agile for its class, and many opponents (except biplanes) will often struggle to get a good shot. The downside to its manoeuvrability is its speed. The Fokker D.XXI-3 is quite primitive, with only landing flaps, and fixed landing gear causing considerable drag. This makes the Fokker D.XXI-3 unable to run away from most opponents, as even some biplanes are capable of catching up. This doesn't mean the plane is weak however, as the engine provides excellent power for such a light machine, allowing it to climb high above most targets.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* Armour: one 9 mm steel plate behind pilot's seat
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 in front of pilot)

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FN-Browning M.36 No.3 (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.7 mm FN-Browning M.36 No.3 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)
* 2 x 7.7 mm FN-Browning M.36 No.3 machine guns, wing-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* High climb rate, especially for a monoplane of this BR
* Only one fuel tank, so fires usually would not be started if the aircraft was tailed
* Great turn time
* Engine takes a while to overheat on WEP
* Sturdy airframe tolerates high speed dives
* Very stable aircraft to fly in simulator battles
* Fixed landing gear makes landings easier and more simplified

'''Cons:'''

* Rather slow, cannot escape fights
* Only has landing flaps
* No armour
