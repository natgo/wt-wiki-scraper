== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Fokker G.1A ''{{Annotation|Jachtkruiser|Air Cruiser (Lit. Hunt Cruiser)}}''''' was a Dutch twin-engined, twin-boom heavy fighter developed in 1937. Nicknamed the "Grim Reaper" by both the French and British due to its heavy firepower, it attracted significant foreign interest for export. Consequently, a smaller variant, the Fokker G.1B / G.1 Wasp, was conceived, equipped with a Pratt & Whitney SB4-G Twin Wasp Junior engine, while the domestic G.1A was powered by the Bristol Mercury VIII engine. By the start of WWII, only 36 G.1As were airworthy. Despite being overwhelmed by German forces, they managed to shoot down up to 167 Ju 52s and achieve 14 confirmed aerial victories.

It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]]. Equipped with 8 x 7.92 mm FN machine guns in the nose with plenty of ammo this aircraft offers a deadly amount of head-on firepower but requires cautious flying and positioning due to its heavy nature. It's up to its pilot to decide whether to use this aircraft as a ground attacker, using bombs and strafing light targets with its MGs or using it in a head-on or interceptor role.
