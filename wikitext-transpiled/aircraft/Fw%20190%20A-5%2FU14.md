== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Focke-Wulf 190 A was the first production series of the Fw 190. Many variants were developed, from the A-1 to the A-8. The A-5 had an extensive list of aircraft that were fitted with different "''Umrüstbausatz''" kits. Most included simple camera additions or weaponry changes, as was the case with the A-5/U14. The U14 was intended to utilize the [[F5b|LT F5b]] torpedo, which was mounted under the fuselage. For safety reasons, the tail wheel and fin height were increased so the torpedo could not accidentally strike the ground. As for armament, the A-5/U14 was only armed with two 20 mm MG 151 cannons mounted near the engine. Two planes were tested in this setup: "TD SI" (model shown in-game) and "TD SJ".

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced as a premium fighter in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. The A-5/U14 was only a very minor development in the A-5, so it is largely the same as other A-5s when it comes to performance. The same engine and airframe were utilized across all the different Umrüstbausatz kits. Armament wise, the A-5/U14 most closely resembles the [[Fw 190 A-5/U2|A-5/U2]] since both carry two [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151]] cannons near the engine. The main difference is the A-5/U14's ability to carry an aerial torpedo, which is only useful in Naval matches, and a select number of Air Realistic Battle maps. Unsurprisingly, equipping the torpedo significantly drops the performance, so players should immediately drop it if an enemy fighter starts attacking.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Fw 190 A-5/U14 has five different steel panels. The two steel rings protect the oil cooling system. The three other steel plates protect the pilot from fighters attacking from the rear. The A-5/U14 has two separate self-sealing fuel tanks underneath the pilot

* 57 mm bulletproof glass pane in front of the pilot
* 3 mm steel ring around the cowling
* 5 mm steel ring around the cowling
* 12 mm steel plate behind the pilot's head
* 8 mm steel plate behind the pilot's torso
* 5 mm steel plate behind the 8 mm steel plate

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, wing-mounted (250 rpg = 500 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|F5b}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 1 x F5b torpedo

In a torpedo bomber role, the Fw 190 needs to maintain low altitude to release a torpedo. The "fragile" characteristics of the torpedo makes a torpedo run complicated, as the torpedo has to be released on low speeds, making the aircraft more vulnerable to ship AA and other enemy aircraft. Launch the torpedo at a distance of 800 m to 1 km. After release, quickly break off from the run and gain altitude, either returning to the airfield to rearm or engage enemy aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Fw 190 A-5 U/14 is an excellent fighter. It has great energy retention in a dive, and an excellent flight performance at higher speeds. As such, it should be used as a Boom and Zoom fighter, as its inferior turn rate will make a turnfight end badly for you. The torpedo bomber role is best used in naval battles, as the torpedo severely impacts the flight performance.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Sturdy airframe
* Good energy retention
* Able to carry a torpedo
* Plentiful ammunition for the 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turn rate
* No other loadouts other than a single torpedo
* The aircraft has to slow down considerably and fly low to release the torpedo
* Enters flat spins easily in Realistic Battles
