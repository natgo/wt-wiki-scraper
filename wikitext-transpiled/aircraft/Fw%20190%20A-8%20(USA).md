== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].

{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 131 (13 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, wing-mounted (250 + 140 rpg each wing = 780 total)
- 2 x 13 mm MG 131 machine guns, nose-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Fw 190 A-8 possesses far below average speed, acceleration, and climb ability for its rank. It does, however, have great high-speed control and a wicked armament that will shred any fighter almost instantly. It is recommended that you climb to the side and let your teammates engage first so you can put your excellent BnZ ability to work. If you spot a bandit co-alt, a head-on attack followed by an evasive manoeuvre and then extending away to repeat the processes is a recommended tactic. If a bandit has superior energy and is pressing an attack against you, try to drag them to friendlies, but don't sacrifice too much energy to do so. If you are skilled enough, another tactic would be to initiate a scissors; either rolling or flat, and then break away when he goes to yo-yo to control his overshoot. The scissors is a highly effective manoeuvre in the 190 A-8. If you are ballsy enough to press for a gun solution when scissoring an enemy, you could be greatly rewarded. In summary, climb to the side, Boom & Zoom like a champ, never get in a sustained turn fight, and use your rate of roll to free yourself when cornered.

==== Specific enemies worth noting ====
The premium Fw 190 A-8 sits at a high battle rating, close to the Spitfire LF Mk. IX and La-7B-20, both of which are vastly superior planes overall. It frequently faces Tempests, Fw 190 A-5, Bf 109 G-10 variants, Griffon Spitfires and F4U-1C's. Unfortunately, the A-8 is by large worse than all of these planes, but it still possesses some unique advantages and if piloted correctly is really going to give anyone trouble. However, these advantages are quite predictable and easily nullified by an attentive opponent.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very strong 4 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons
- Great roll rate
- Great energy retention
- Heavy armament
- Wide track landing gear makes landing easier
- Plenty of ammo
- Well armoured from the front

'''Cons:'''

- Large, slow turn rate combined with no combat flaps greatly reduces dogfight efficiency
- Elevator has low responsibility & effect on low-medium speeds
- Manoeuvrability at low speeds is bad
- Bad climb rate for a 190

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

On January 1, 1945, an Fw 190 A-8 (W.Nr. 681497) flown by Corporal Walter Wagner from 4./JG 4 landed at the allied-held field at St Trond, Belgium, after having been hit by flak and being forced to make an emergency landing during Operation Bodenplatte. From here it was transferred to the 404th Fighter Group, USAAF.<ref name="Wikimedia description">US Army Air Forces. File:Fw 190 A-8.Jpg.
