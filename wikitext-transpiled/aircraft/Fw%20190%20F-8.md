== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} is the main serial production of the F-series [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]] fighter. The F-series is designed as a multirole ground attack fighter-bomber aircraft meant to replace the obsolete [[Ju 87 (Family)|Ju 87]] dive bomber. The F-8 variant is based on the [[Fw 190 A-8]],  featuring reinforced airframe to allow it to carry its payload of up to a 1,000 kg bomb. To compensate for worsened flight performance, the F-8 features a slightly modified compressor injector which improves the engine's performance at low altitudes. Despite 6,143 F-8 models were produced it could never fully replace it this late into the war (1944), and as such the F-8 often ended being used as a low altitude fighter-interceptor instead of its ground attacking role.

Being in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. The {{PAGENAME}} is a Fw 190 who thought it was a Stuka. The F-8 version is a peculiar one, being classed as a strike aircraft due to its relatively heavy suspended armaments. As an attacker, this Focke-Wulf gains mid-air start on most maps which can either be used to get to ground targets quickly or get the jump on climbing fighters. While generally more sluggish than the A-8 variant, the F-8 features a 30 mm gun pods that allows it to dismantle the enemy planes in a few hits. The F-8 is perhaps one of the most versatile Fw 190s in the game, though it tends to be outperformed in most categories by more specialised planes.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Being essentially a modified [[Fw 190 A-8]] for ground attacking role, the {{PAGENAME}}'s general flight performance is generally similar to the A-8, though being noticably more sluggish to handle, especially while stock. The F-8 retains the typical handling of the Fw 190 series; good roll rate and high-speed handling, but mediocre climb rate and atrocious turn rate. Which means it can perform reasonably well as a boom-and-zoom fighter, though not as well as delicated fighter variant. The F-8's heavier airframe resulting into the plane often struggle in a prolonged dogfights, as it will herrmorage its energy much faster than other delicated fighters.

A caveat worth noting is that, while the F-8 can performs as a boom-and-zoom fighter, it suffers from rudder lock-ups at higher speed (~650 km/h), which may results in a fatal failed-pull ups if the pilot are not careful. On the plus side, while the F-8 does not have a delicated combat flaps, the takeoff flaps can be used instead in place of it to improve its manoverability due to its unusually high rip speed (~700 km/h).

As it was classified as a strike aircraft, the F-8 greatly benefits from its access to an air spawn, as it gains a headstart speed to help it climb up to medium altitudes (~3,000 - 4,000 m) at the start of the match. This allows the F-8 to gain an altitude advantage against most fighters, and even capable of intercepting bombers.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The attacker "Würger" has such awful responsiveness from the elevator that anything which improves turn rate should have the highest priority. Otherwise, it will kiss the ground more than cows do! Don't forget, it needs to dive-bomb to hit anything. And grinding the bombs cannot be forgotten!! This is an attacker, so it needs the payload unlocks, but without performance upgrades, it is just a pain to fly. A detour to the new belts could be considered, but two 20 mm cannons are enough to handle any ground units even with stock ammunition, especially as the other performance upgrades are necessary as well due the F-8's great weight.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 131 (13 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, wing-mounted (250 rpg = 500 total)
* 2 x 13 mm MG 131 machine guns, nose-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)

The 13 mm IAI belts are extremely potent against bomber and fighter aircraft alike; featuring a mere 1 g of explosive mass. The belts have a strong chance to simply rupture the airframe or disable many flammable modules at the same time.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Fw 190 F-8 possesses below average speed, acceleration and climb ability for its rank. If you spot a bandit at the same altitude, a recommended tactic is to head-on attack, followed by an evasive manoeuvre and then extending away to repeat the processes. If a bandit has superior energy/altitude and is trying to attack you, try to drag them to friendlies, but don't sacrifice too much altitude to do so. If you are skilled enough, another tactic would be to initiate scissors; either rolling or flat, and then break away when he goes to yo-yo to control his overshoot. The scissors manoeuvre is a highly effective manoeuvre in the 190s. Many good pilots have dismembered many superior aircraft simply because of the roll rate and firepower this plane possesses. If you are clever enough to press for a gun solution when scissoring an enemy, you could be greatly rewarded.

In summary for the unintended fighter-role, climb to the side or continue climbing when starting mid-air, Boom & Zoom like a champion, never get in a sustained turn fight, and use the rate of roll to free yourself when cornered. The F-8 is most likely to be successful in realistic battles when used as a ground-attacker or bomber hunter. [[B-17 (Family)|B-17s]] and [[Halifax B Mk IIIa|Halifaxes]] are unlikely to fly at higher altitudes than the F-8 can perform at, which allows for the F-8s armament (especially with the 30 mm gunpods) and decent durability to be useful while not being held back by its relatively poor dogfighting capability. It is best to make quick, diving attack passes targeting the wings and engines before extending out to avoid return fire from the bomber's defensive guns. Do not turn back until you are at least 1 km away from the bomber to avoid being an easy target. Until the frontal gunpods are unlocked, 2-3 passes may be required to fully destroy a bomber. Frontal attacks can also be effective especially with the engines and cockpit both viable targets, but with the trade-off being less time to shoot at the target (this goes both ways, you won't be in the range of defensive guns for very long either).

In combined forces battles, the Fw 190 F-8 can carry a wider range of ordnance than most other German fighters, allowing for ground-attack using rockets, gun pods, bombs or equipping them together because of the ability to make custom load-outs. The 1,000 kg bomb is unique to F-8 among German fighters; while the [[Do 335 (Family)|Do 335 (A-1 & B-2 variants)]] and [[Me 410 (Family)|Me-410 (A1 & B1 variants)]] can carry 1,000 kg worth of bombs, they can only carry 250 kg and 500 kg bombs. The F-8 combines the ability to carry heavy ordnance while still retaining decent fighting capability after dropping said ordnance.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list.

'''Pros:'''

* Retains most of the positive flight qualities of the Fw 190 series: Good roll rate and high speed handling
* While the plane does not have a delicated combat flaps, the take-off flaps can be used in place of it due to its very high rip speed (~700 km/h)
* Has an airspawn, allows the plane to easily get a headstart above most fighters and intercept bombers
* Heavy suspended weapon options, including up to 1,200 kg of bombs or 30 mm gun pods with an access to anti-tank rounds
* Powerful main armaments with high ammo capacity, the 30 mm gun pods can further augmented the plane's firepower with minimal performance loss
* Very durable airframe, capable of taking a lot of punishments

'''Cons:'''

* Awful stock grind; the plane is essentially a worse [[Fw 190 A-8]] when its offensive armaments and flight performances were not upgraded
* Heavier and more sluggish than other Fw 190 variants, resulting into worsened handling, often got beaten by delicated fighters in a dogfight
* As with other Fw 190 variants, the plane's climb rate is rather mediocre and the turn rate is terrible
* Carrying heavy payload will significantly reduces the plane's flight performance
* Rudder is unresponsive at higher speeds (~650 km/h), which may causes the plane to crash into the ground, especially while stock

The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Wuerger (Shrike) was a single-seat single-engine monoplane fighter used by the Luftwaffe in WWII. One of the best fighters of the time, it was widely used during the Second World War. A total of over 20,000 were produced, including some 6,000 fighter-bomber variants. The 190 remained in production from 1941 until the end of the war, going through multiple redesigns. The Fw 190 made a name for itself as a true Luftwaffe workhorse and was used in a wide variety of roles, including a high-altitude interceptor (especially the Fw 190D), escort fighter, fighter-bomber and night fighter.

The Fw 190 F-8 was the most mass-produced variant of the Fw 190 F series, based on the Fw 190 A-8. By March 1944, Fw 190 F-8s were also produced by the Arado company in Warnemuende, and by April the NDW company in Wismar. The aircraft was powered by the BMW 801 D-2 engine with improved injector on the compressor, which provided emergency power for up to 10-15 minutes at 1,000 m of altitude. Otherwise, the plane's equipment was largely similar to the A-8, although the FuG 16 ZY radio was replaced with the FuG 16 ZS in April 1944. This allowed direct communication with ground troops on the battlefield. A distinctive characteristic of the F-8 was a widened rear canopy. The new canopy was introduced in the latter half of 1944. It improved forward and downward visibility, which was very important for ground attack. On-board armament consisted of twin MG 131 machine guns in the fuselage and two MG 151/20E cannon in the wings.
