== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27 in the German aviation tree. In [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]], the G.50 as well as the other Italian planes in the German tech tree were moved to the new Italian tree, although it still exists in the German tree for those who unlocked it prior to Update 1.69.

The Fiat G.50 is the oldest of the ''Series 0'' planes, its fellow stablemates are the M.C. 200 and Re.2000, both built around the same 860 HP radial engine and having the same armament.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

In general, it is a slightly worse version of the M.C 200, and as such, it very much flies the same, albeit a little bit slower. With its decent rate of climb, it's generally best to ensure you have proper altitude to play around with first. Generally for low-tier planes like the G.50, 3,000 - 4,000 m is generally enough, from there, the way of flying should be dedicated by the situation and opponents. Its good acceleration in dives and respectable dive speeds means it can be used as a pure Boom and Zoomer, especially when you realise its energy retention is better than that of many other planes at its BR. However, it is a decent turn-fighter, barring the poor acceleration so it can be used as such as well. Be careful against regular biplanes and Japanese monoplanes, both of which are considerably better, bar high speeds, where the stiffness of controls on the G.50 are less than on either biplanes or Japanese planes.

The Fiat G.50 Freccia is a typical Italian pre-war design and therefore fairly sturdy, it hasa modest speed and poor armament consisting of 2 Breda SAFAT 12.7 mm guns mounted in the upper cowling, which means it has the distinctive low rate of fire (roughly 400 rounds per minutes). However it does have its merits as well, it's fairly agile, it has no trouble dogfighting Hurricanes it will commonly face, and if things become too hectic, the G.50 can quickly escape by going into a dive, and exploit its surprisingly good dive acceleration to gain separation. Furthermore, it pays to be aware of its modest acceleration and overheating, as such, it's generally advised to maintain an eye on your speed and use WEP sparingly.

For the armament, the same applies to all other Italian aircraft; generally, you want to use Tracers, Air targets or Stealth since they are the belts that deal the most damage. Shell velocity is low, hence they suffer above 300 m, so only fire at or below that range for best effects. Furthermore, much like the other Italian fighters, the armament is woefully inadequate to deal with bombers, hence it is best to avoid them entirely, or focus on taking out the engines. The only exceptions are the very early biplane bombers, such as the [[Swordfish Mk I|Swordfish]], [[Po-2]] and the likes.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The G.50 Freccia ("Arrow") was the first Italian all-metal monoplane fighter, which, although clearly inferior to allied fighters of the time, was the best Italian fighter aircraft.

Development of the fighter began in 1936, at the request of the Italian Air Force, and ended with the creation of an easy-to-manage and extremely manoeuvrable interceptor. The "Arrow" used such modern technology as a constant-speed all-metal propeller and variable pitch, as well as retractable landing gear. The "Arrow" however, could not take advantage of the monoplane design because its engine was too weak (at 840 hp). The aircraft's limited armament was also a weakness - it had two synchronous large-calibre machine guns with 150 rounds of ammunition.

The first series of 45 G.50s, production of which began in late 1937, had a closed cockpit, and while it provided relatively good visibility, the pilots were not very enthusiastic about it, so the second series of planes (200 aircraft) were built with an open cockpit. All in all, 833 G.50s were build (including all variants).

Besides Italy, the plane served in Finland, Croatia, and Spain as well.
