== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]] as a premium purchasable in-game for Golden Eagles {{ge}}. It was later added to the store as a [[wt:en/news/7087-shop-new-packs-and-a-unique-bundle-en|premium pack]] in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]] until it was removed after the [[wt:en/news/7417-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-in-gaijin-net-store-en|9th Anniversary Sale]], but was later re-introduced as a regular in-game premium for {{GE}}.

The R/4 is a variant of the G.91 jet fighter that has been modified for ground attack, allowing it access to a competitive selection of air-to-ground ordnance such as bombs, rockets, and high-explosive air-to-ground missiles. The R/4 also has the option to equip two different types of air-to-air missiles; the IR-tracking [[AIM-9B Sidewinder]] missile, or the command-guided [[AA-20 Nord]] missile.

The G.91 R/4 is a very nimble fighter with relatively average top speed and fairly good acceleration. Best played as a support fighter, the G.91 R/4 can use its incredible roll and turn rates to quickly get guns on target, as well as to dodge the typically less manoeuvrable fighters that it shares its battle ratings with.

The main difference between the [[G.91 R/3|R/3]] and the [[G.91 R/4|R/4]] is the armament choice. While the former has more powerful cannons, it lacks the capability to mount air-to-air missiles while the later is the opposite, weaker machine guns but it is able to use air-to-air missiles.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The G.91 was intended to replace the [[F-86A-5|F-86A Sabre]] in German, Portuguese and Italian service and it shows. With an empty weight of only 3,100 kg (6,800 lbs) and a takeoff weight of 5,500 kg (12,100 lbs) the Gina is in the weight class as the [[P-51D-5|P-51D]] and [[MiG-9]], yet severely lighter than most other jets and losing about one and a half tonnes compared to the Sabre A.

Although only outputting a meagre 22 kN of thrust, this first look disadvantage is literally outweighed by the high thrust to weight ratio of 0.73 empty (0.41 full). This makes the Gina an excellent dogfighter as jet fighters maintain both their top speed, climb and sustained turn-rate by their engine power rather than other flight characteristics. It can easily reach its own terminal speed (1,011 km/h, 921 ft/s) and self-destruct in level flight.

Lacking in straight wings and leading wing slats, the stall speed for the G.91 is higher than the low weight leads one to assume. One should hence be wary of many older jet types with said features, as after bleeding too much speed they can easily out-manoeuvre the Gina.

Starting with 20 min of fuel, gaining the climb speed of 800 km/h IAS (sustainable @ 7-8°; 730 ft/s) takes a mere ~80 seconds with 20 predicated for taking off at 230 km/h or 210 ft/s IAS. An Immelmann at 800 km/h will gain 1000 m and lose 300 km/h. A hard 180° turn at the same speed takes >100 km/h and may lose up to 60 m.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 40 mm Bulletproof glass in front of the pilot
* 6.5 mm Steel plate, starts in the pilot's seat, goes below the pilot, ends in front of the pilot
* 6.5 mm Steel plate below a fuel tank in the centre-front of the fuselage
* 6.5 mm Steel plate below a fuel tank in the centre-rear of the fuselage

Though the G.91 R/4 does have a decent amount of armour spaced out between the centre and front of the fuselage, the steel plates will only be sufficient to protect the pilot and aircraft from lower calibre fire (7.92 mm to 7.62 mm machine guns will only penetrate at '''very''' close ranges). And, thanks to the sacrifices made to lighten the aircraft, the airframe is not particularly reinforced. The wings are very thin, and susceptible to being out-right broken off by most-all primary armaments the G.91 will face at its tier, and the fuselage is full of juicy fuel tanks as well as the single engine of the R/4. Even more so than most planes, the G.91 R/4 is not capable of taking any hits. Even low calibre fire, such as that from .50 calibre machine guns, can cripple an R/4 nigh-immediately, and necessitate an immediate return-to-base.

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|Aerea 559G1 incendiary|FFAR Mighty Mouse|M3 Browning (12.7 mm)}}
{{main|AA-20 Nord|AIM-9B Sidewinder|AS-20 Nord}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 4 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (300 rpg = 1,200 total)
* 4 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 38 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets
* 2 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 2 x AA-20 Nord missiles
* 2 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 2 x AS-20 Nord missiles
* 2 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 4 x AS-20 Nord missiles
* 2 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 4 x AA-20 Nord missiles
* 2 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs + 2 x AS-20 Nord missiles (1,000 lb total)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs + 2 x AA-20 Nord missiles (1,000 lb total)
* 4 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 4 x AIM-9B Sidewinder missiles
* 4 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (1,000 lb total)
* 4 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns + 2 x Aerea 559G1 incendiary bombs

Featuring a wide range of ordnance, the G.91 R/4 can be equipped for any role from ground to air combat, though it prefers air superiority.

The M3 Browning is a new weapon in the German arsenal at rank V and compared to the previous experiences a let down. The rate of fire is phenomenal, but the small calibre and ammo size put a serious damper to the mood, that is in comparison of course. In practise and with good aim, it can easily shred four fighters. The high bullet velocity and fire rate is quite the advantage in the fast pace world of jet combat, ensuring hits in deflection shots were the lower rate of fire found in the [[:Category:Fifth_rank_aircraft|Soviet jet fighters]] might have failed the pilot.

Yet one will always look onto greener pastures, especially as the Gina only has four guns unlike all other Browning armed jets. No matter how you turn it, the armament is only manageable with skill and outright bad for a beginner.

For air-to-ground purposes, the G.91 R/4 is similar to the [[G.91 R/3]] in loadout options, sharing the same FFAR Mighty Mouse rocket option as well as the choice of a pair of 500 lb bombs. However, the G.91 R/4 must sacrifice half of its machine guns to carry 4 x AS-20 Nord air-to-ground missiles.

Air-to-air ordnance selection is where the G.91 R/4 stands out from its brethren; the G.91 R/4 is able to load the unique AA-20 Nord air-to-air missiles; keyboard guided missiles with a 15 metre proximity fuse. Unlike infrared-guided missiles in War Thunder, the AA-20 Nords do not warn targets of a missile launch giving R/4 pilots the element of surprise, and the Nord's proximity fuse increases the chance of long-range launches striking a target as well as successful head-ons, though these perks come at the demand of a much higher skill floor for usage.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Due to the G.91 R/4's notably lower speed and high-end acceleration as compared to its contemporaries, the R/4 should be played as a support fighter; meaning the pilot should seek to stick near teammates rather than hunting targets solo, and opt to pick off hostile aircraft that are engaged and distracted with/by allied fighters. The G.91 airframe is exceptionally agile, and the R/4 is no exception; even heavily manoeuvring targets are easy for this plane to keep the nose on. The plane's exceptional roll and turn rates are its biggest strengths, and the pilot should seek to use that to their advantage rather than attempting to fight speed or energy battles.

Make use of the G.91 R/4's varied suspended armaments to dispatch a variety of targets. The AIM-9B is very easy to use missile and can force faster targets to manoeuvre, slowing them down, and can sometimes even net target destructions. Be careful when using this missile around friendlies though, as a misguided Sidewinder '''will''' destroy allied aircraft. The AA-20 Nord is a much more difficult missile to use, but it has a far longer effective range and can often surprise enemies who expect a warning from enemy missile launches. Use the massive range and proximity fuse to take down faster targets flying away from you, and consider using them to destroy bombers such as the often-seen [[S.O.4050 Vautour IIB|Vautour IIB]], [[S.O.4050 Vautour IIA|Vautour IIA]], and [[Vautour_IIA IDF/AF (France)|Israeli Vautour IIA]], who not only are far less able to dodge missiles but also have larger airframes that trigger the proximity fuse from longer distances.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Exceptional manoeuvrability, with very high roll and turn rates
* Varied and effective suspended armament choices
* Access to air-to-air missiles, including the [[AA-20 Nord]]
* Access to 4 x [[AS-20 Nord]] like its [[G.91_R/3|predecessor]]

'''Cons:'''

* Relatively low calibre primary armament (four .50 cal Brownings)
* Slower than most of its contemporaries
* Very fragile airframe
* Poor energy retention

== History ==

The G.91 R/3 was the primary West German variant of the Fiat-made light fighter, with 50 built in Italy and another 294 under license in West Germany. It had more powerful armament, added two wing hardpoints, and improved avionics compared to the Italian G.91 R-1s. The 50 R/4 that followed were identical to the R/3 other than in terms of armament. The R/4 supposed to have been sold to Greece and Turkey, but after that sale fell through they entered West German service instead.
