== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

The {{PAGENAME}} is a multi-role fighter which first debuted in 1966. Based largely on earlier Fiat G.91 fighters, the G.91 YS was a complete redesign but kept the basic shape of the G.91 series. The biggest difference between the two types was the conversion from a single-engine to two General Electric J85 turbojets outfitted with afterburners. This conversion alone resulted in a 60% increase in the aircraft's thrust, however, it was not enough for this jet to become supersonic even when in a dive.

In similar fashion to the earlier French fighter, the [[Super Mystere B2]], the {{PAGENAME}} was outfitted with dual 30 mm DEFA autocannons in the cheeks of the forward fuselage.  Also in the same vein, the {{PAGENAME}} was built to be a multi-role fighter as a fighter-interceptor or a fighter-bomber. Due to the increased power of the dual engines, this fighter when acting in a bomber role has the ability to carry up to 4,000 lbs of bombs, though configurations as low as 1,000 lbs is available. FFAR Mighty Mouse unguided rockets are another good option for taking out softer ground targets in which the larger 500 – 1,000 lb bombs would otherwise be overkill.

The {{PAGENAME}} while lacking in the supersonic flight department is a feisty little fellow which can still hold its own in an air-to-air combat role. The dual autocannons can make quick work of any head-on attacks provided the pilot gets out of the way of incoming bullets in return. AIM-9B Sidewinder missiles prove themselves very effective especially against slower targets such as bombers and helicopters but are a bit more difficult to achieve success against other fighters due to their ability to pull high-G manoeuvres and break the missile lock and avoid them.

The pilot has the option to change up the load-out of the aircraft due to the map he finds himself on and what they are comfortable with. Air-to-air and ground-attack options are both viable and can help change the tide of the battle by loading up on what the team needs more.

[[File:G91YS Jermster 91 001.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A bird's eye view of a {{PAGENAME}} fighter.]]
The {{PAGENAME}} is a very good Boom & Zoom fighter, the only issue is confronting other jets with afterburner capabilities which make your Boom & Zoom attempt more difficult. The YS has a lower turn speed than the other G.91s (swapped for acceleration and a little bit more speed) it is also two high power engines, making it possible to return to base on one engine or even fight like that if you want. Sadly the G.91 isn't supersonic but it can get close in a steep dive, making it one of the best trans-sonic jets!

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 40 mm bulletproof glass in the canopy windshield (angled to provide about 94 mm of protection)
* 6.5 mm steel behind pilot's seat

Like many later generation jet fighters (those built in the 1960s-70s) the {{PAGENAME}} traded armour for greater ordnance carrying capacity. Though not without all armour, the canopy windshield has an effective thickness of 94 mm to protect the pilot in the event of a head-on attack. Though the 6.5 mm of steel behind the pilot's seat seem to be on the thin side, bullets coming in from that direction will need to pass through the engine first. If the pilot is going to be hit by bullets it will most likely be through side angle shots or from above.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The G.91 YS has a lot of power and energy potential, keep that in mind before going into battle. To add to this fighters punch, it also utilises AIM 9B missiles and in capable hands, this fighter can be a monster on the battlefield. The YS also has the capability of mounting 76 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets which provide the potential of low-altitude Boom & Zooming on trucks, anti-aircraft artillery, light tanks and even enemy fighters attempting an airfield capture, though this does not come without a cost. When dropping in low on ground targets, the fighter sacrifices its speed and manoeuvrability for that ordnance. The YS also can outfit a few bombs so the YS can then be used as a base bomber following up by attacking enemy fighters, but even still it isn't always reliable and can be easily intercepted from any other supersonic fighter jets patrolling the area.

Your biggest threats will be F-4Cs, MiG-19S/PT, F-100D, Mitsubishi T2, J-6A, J-7II, Hunter F.6, mainly because they have superior speed and ordnance. The Hunter is probably the best-matched jet to the {{PAGENAME}}. The only top tier jet which should not be too much of a pain is the Super Mystere B2, and F-86K because they have limited speed and slow acceleration compared and will never win in a vertical climb against the {{PAGENAME}}.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent acceleration and roll speed
* Able to carry air-to-air missiles
* Wide variety of payload options
* High rate of climb
* Deadly main armament
* Drag chute helps slow you down very quickly during landings

'''Cons:'''

* Slower than most planes it will face
* Limited ammo
* Slower turn rate compared to earlier G.91s
* Flaps and landing gear are prone to ripping off
* New booster module is a must to research in order to avoid crashing during a very fast and low-level dive
* AIM-9Bs have a poorer performance other air-to-air missiles at this BR

== History ==

During the 1960s, Fiat began developing a successor to their previous G.91 fighter, which had thus far managed to obtain a favourable reputation with its operators. Fiat based their new aircraft heavily on the two-seat trainer version of the G.91 and decided outfit the aircraft with two General Electric J85 afterburning engines contrary to the preceding single-engine G.91.

Additionally, the aircraft's fuselage and wings were enlarged to accommodate 3 more fuel tanks (for a total capacity of 3200 liters), bigger powerplant and improve handling characteristics, while a slew of other tweaks and upgrades further enhanced the aircraft's overall design, including an automatic slat on the wing's leading edge. The new G.91Y performed its maiden flight in December 1966. Testing revealed minor aerodynamic issues which would be resolved on subsequent production aircraft with only minor redesigns. At high altitude extreme manoeuvres at high angles of attack could lead to engines flame-out.

Production of the G.91Y began with an initial order for 20 pre-production machines, following the manufacturing of two prototypes. This order would eventually go up to 75 aircraft, although only 67 including the initial prototypes were delivered in the end. By the mid 1970s, all outstanding orders for the G.91Y were fulfilled and production had ceased for this variant.

The G.91Y served exclusively with Italian squadrons up until the early 1990s, before being replaced by a more modern counterpart.

The G.91YS was a single prototype conversion of the G.91Y, which followed a requirement issued by the Swiss Air Force. The aircraft allowed installation of American Sidewinder air-to-air missiles (adding 2 more sub-wing pylons) and a Swedish weapons control system. This special prototype first flew in October 1970, but was eventually not accepted into service by the Swiss. The prototype was converted back into service as a regular G.91Y.
