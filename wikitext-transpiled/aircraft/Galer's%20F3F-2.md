== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
'''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]]. The plane is painted after the camouflage scheme of American pilot Bob Galer in the USMC, whose plane can be viewed today at the National Naval Aviation Museum.

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
[[File:Galer's F3F screenshot 5.jpg|thumb]]
The F3F-2 is a highly manoeuvrable aircraft as would be expected from its biplane configuration, this allows it to competitively turn with majority of the enemy aircraft that it encounters, the energy retention is good at lower speeds (<250 km/h), but at higher speeds the F3F-2 will lose energy quickly when in a hard turn, problems will be found when facing higher BR monoplane fighters which will have a considerably superior top speed this can cause problems due to the slower speed of the F3F.

Despite the slower speed of the F3F-2 it does have good early acceleration (0-240 km/h) and will usually be one of the first aircraft in the air at the start of the match thanks to its 210 m needed takeoff distance, the 16 m/s climb rate will also allow for the F3F-2 to have an altitude against majority of the enemy fighters that it will face.

The F3F is first and foremost a fighter aircraft, this is a role in which it thrives with its brilliant manoeuvrability allowing it to deal with majority of enemy aircraft in a turn fight, trying to get an enemy aircraft to turn with you will be the best way to engage and win a fight, if the enemy is a monoplane they will usually have worse performance at slower speeds, so making them turn and lose energy is a good way to gain an advantage with your superior slow speed performance, if the enemy aircraft is also a biplane your main focus should be preventing them from getting guns onto your aircraft, if you can gain a turning advantage you should move into position and attempt to down the enemy aircraft, your two guns can end up putting lots of rounds into an enemy, but a hit to any critical component such as the pilot or engine will either end the fight or put it strongly in your favour. It is best to avoid "head on" engagements with enemy aircraft, as the engine on the F3F has a large frontal profile (Radial engine) along with the engine front being exposed, this makes the engine being hit a common occurrence and without your engine survival is unlikely.

The F3F will commonly come across aircraft with superior top speed, such as many of the early Bf 109 variants (A,B-1,E-1 & F-1), these aircraft will usually attempt to use a "boom & zoom" attack style against your aircraft, the best you can do is to keep a good amount of energy and be ready to evade when the commit to an attack run, if you can evade them for long enough you will hopefully receive some help from some of your other team members or you might be able to make the enemy try and commit to a turn fight where you should have an advantage and be able to critically damage or down their aircraft.

As for using the F3F for close air support (CAS) you will have a few possibilities, the most popular choice will be to take the two 100 lb bombs (AN-M30A1), these only contain 24.5 kg of explosive mass so you will need to land them very close to the intended target to do any meaningful damage. A second option is to use your .50 cal (12.7 mm) Browning M2 machine gun to destroy ground targets, all belts for this gun have 26 mm of penetration, although the ground targets belts are best as they contain more AP rounds, these will be able to go through SPAA (Self Propelled Anti Aircraft) vehicles as well as some light & medium tanks, firing for the upper armour or side armour on enemy vehicles will usually prove to be the most effective way of going through enemy armour.

It is recommended not to hold the brakes on landing, as the F3F will likely flip over, it is best to tap the breaks on and off to avoid this occurring.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list.

[[File:Galer's F3F screenshot 4.jpg|thumb]]

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent manoeuvrability
* Very low stalling speed
* Controls are extremely responsive
* Powerful .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine gun
* Climb rate is competitive against aircraft of similar [[Battle ratings|BR]]
* Two 100 lb bombs for attacking ground targets

'''Cons:'''

* Small primary armament which can be inadequate against large targets
* Low ammunition count for the 12.7 mm machine gun
* Can flip over the nose when landing if the brakes are held down too long
* The 100 lb bombs have a small explosive warhead and therefore aren't very effective against ground targets

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

Galer’s F3F-2 is the F3F-2 flown by then-First-Lieutenant Bob Galer, USMC, who was forced to bail out during landing operations. Lt. Galer would become a double-ace during WWII, having survived being shot down four times, received the Medal of Honor for heroism at Guadalcanal, and retired as a brigadier general. Galer’s F3F-2 was recovered in 1988 from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean; following a reunion with the aircraft’s former pilot, the plane is now on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum of the United States.

Robert ‘Bob’ E. Galer was a naval aviator in the United States navy, having joined the navy in 1936. While assigned to Marine Fighting Squadron two (VMF-2), he was attempting a landing on the USS Saratoga (CV-3) when his F3F-2 failed; as a result, he was forced to ditch the aircraft into the ocean. He was later stationed in Hawaii for most of 1941, promoted to the rank of captain. He was stationed with VMF-211 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour on December 7th, 1941.

Galer was given command of VMF-224 in May of 1942 and later fought at the Battle of Guadalcanal; it was during this conflict that he shot down 11 enemy aircraft, becoming a double-ace and receiving the Medal of Honor for his actions. Galer was also awarded the British Distinguished Flying Cross, a rare occurrence for the time. Afterwards, Galer served as assistant operations officer at Naval Air Station (NAS) Miramar; he was not permitted to fly in combat due to his status as a medal-of-honor recipient, exacerbated by the fact that he had been shot down three times already.

By 1945, Galer had obtained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Staying with the navy, he was sent to Korea in 1952 as a full Colonel, received a Gold Star (in lieu of a second Distinguished Flying medal) for leading an aerial attack on Pyongyang. He was shot down once more in August of 1952 after being hit by anti-aircraft fire. Galer returned to the United States after the end of the Korean conflict and retired in 1957 at the rank of Brigadier-General; he later served as vice-president of Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) later as an executive with Bright & Co. He would be reunited with his former F3F-2 in 1988 after the aircraft was recovered from the depths of the Pacific Ocean. Brigadier General Galer died of a stroke on 27 June 2005 in Dallas, Texas; he is survived by his wife, four children and six grandchildren. Galer’s F3F-2 is now on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum, restored to its markings when flown by Galer in 1940.
