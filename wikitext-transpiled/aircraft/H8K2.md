In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 "Battle March"]].

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The H8K2 can be thought of as a Japanese version of the German [[BV 238]], and plays similarly. However, there are some key differences between the two aircraft. The H8K2 can be used in both Naval battles, and Air battles, though there are some key limitations. The aircraft has a strong defensive armament suite of ten guns (five 20 mm cannons and five 7.7 mm machine guns), and can also carry a pair of torpedoes. However, it is a very large aircraft, and is easily shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire. In general, the aircraft should avoid close-in, frontline combat, and instead be used as a heavy bomber/support aircraft.

The first playstyle for this aircraft would be a heavy bomber in RB. The aircraft benefits from airspawn, meaning that it is much less vulnerable from interception. However, there is one key limitation to this role - the H8K2's tiny payload. The aircraft can only carry a maximum of 1,600 kg of bombs, in two 800 kg bombs. This effectively limits the aircraft to destroying a single base, which doesn't yield great bonuses. The 800 kg bombs are also ineffective against ground targets, as they drop together. This means that the only viable option against ground targets are the 60 kg bombs. However, these are also rather ineffective due to their tiny size and low explosive mass.

The second, and more interesting playstyle would be in Naval RB. The aircraft is a floatplane, meaning that it can be used to cap bases. As well, the aircraft can carry two torpedoes, which are very effective against larger vessels. Thus, the aircraft could be used as a torpedo-bomber, staying low and attacking enemies with torpedoes from a distance. However, do not approach to close to enemy naval vessels, as the H8K is massive and an easy target for enemy AAA.

When being attacked, one excellent option is the H8K's defensive armament. The 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannons are essentially upgraded MG FF cannons, and can do extensive damage to attacking fighters. However, take note that the aircraft has very limited protection from the underside, similar to other flying boats. Try to bait attacking fighters to your six (and slightly to the right or left), so that you can engage them with the tail, dorsal and beam turrets.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Widely recognized as the best maritime combat aircraft of WWII, the H8K2 was the main production model of the H8K series of bombers, making up 112 of the 167 total H8Ks of all variants. In 1938, just as its predecessor, the H6K, was entering service, the Imperial Navy ordered the development of a larger aircraft with longer range suited for solo bombing and patrol missions. The resulting H8K flying boats, entering service in February 1942, performed well until the end of the war, and were respected by allied pilots for their fearsome defensive armament. After the war, an H8K2 (one of only four which survived the war) was captured by American forces, and was eventually returned to Japan in 1979, where it remains on display to this day.
