== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 "Battle March"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

- 20 mm steel plates protecting rear gunner
- 5 mm steel behind pilots
- 5 mm protecting dorsal gunner
- 5 mm behind hull fuel tanks

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- '''H'''8K for Flying boat:
  ** Bomber spawn
  ** Landing floats
  **\* Can capture points in Naval
  ** Excellent combined defensive armament
  ** 2 x [[Type 91 Model 3 (850 kg)|Type 91 Aerial Torpedo]] \*** Torpedo has the highest drop speed in the game at {{Annotation|580 km/h|350 mph}} and is one of the most feared torpedoes in Naval Battles
  ** 16 x [[Navy Type 97 Number 6 (60 kg)|Type 97 No.6 Land Bomb (60 kg)]] \*** Gets 2 x bomb racks of 8 x 60 kg bombs which can be used to hit multiple targets
  ** 2 [[Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 (800 kg)|No.80 Land Bomb (800 kg)]] \*** Heaviest bomb Japanese Navy can offer
- '''H8K''' specific:
  ** Decent defensive armament for its rank: [[Type 99 Model 1 (20 mm)|20 mm Type 99 Model 1 Cannon]]
  ** Quite fast for its size and rank
  ** Incredible climb rate
  ** Decently survivable with armour and self-sealing tanks
- '''{{PAGENAME}}'''
  ** Improved aerodynamics due retractable landing gear \*** Faster
  \*\*\* Better climb rate

'''Cons:'''

- '''H'''8K for Flying boat:
  ** Huge target
  ** Lack of land-suitable gear
  **\* Very unreliable to land on regular run-ways
  ** Bombs drop in series
- Common Navy plane construction:
  ** Poor defensive armament: [[Type 99 Model 1 (20 mm)|20 mm Type 99 Model 1 Cannon]] \*** Very low muzzle velocity
  \*\* Poor defensive armament: [[Type 92 (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm Type 92 MG]]

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The H8K3 was a prototype variant of the H8K2. It was modified to allow the dorsal turret and the landing floats to retract, as well as to include fowler flaps, and the blisters which housed the side guns were replaced with sliding hatches. All such changes were made in order to reduce drag and thereby increase speed (Note: None of the turret modifications are currently modeled in game). A total of only 2 were built.
