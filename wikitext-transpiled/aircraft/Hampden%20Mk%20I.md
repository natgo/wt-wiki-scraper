== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].

The Hampden is one of the first bombers you get in the British tree, and without a doubt defines the style of flying for the remainder of the tree. Its decent performance combined with all-powerful bomb load can quickly rack your score up into the thousands. On maps like Essen, use your superior speed to bomb the ground targets before any other bombers, then drop your altitude and rearm at the airfield. After, fly low with a bomb delay and hit the remaining targets or bases.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Hampden Mk I is an average early bomber which, though rather average, should not be taken lightly. It is able to take quite a large bombload for its size, allowing it to take out bomb points and ground targets with ease.

The below tactics can be used in all games modes:

'''How to offensively engage an enemy aircraft:'''

If you happen to see an enemy aircraft, you should not engage it. Only in cases where it's the last enemy player or it should be at and disadvantage should the Hampden be brave enough to attack an enemy aircraft. Hampden should try and climb above the enemy then dive to get in front of target. Then use its defensive four 7.7 mm machine guns to tear into enemy aircraft's cockpit and knock out the pilot, engines and any gunners. This way try to use the defensive armaments in an offensive way. The single offensive .30 cal machine gun might not put out enough firepower to take out enemy aircraft, other than some reserve and lower battle rating aircraft, since it's only a single .30 cal with 300 rounds which will limit the damage the Hampden can do.

'''How to perform defensive fighting:'''
Best way for the Hampden Mk I to defend itself is by trying to get the enemy aircraft to get on the rear where its 4 x 7.7 mm Vickers K machine guns have the coverage to be able to fire at the enemy. Lacking 360 degree turrets makes the Vickers have a limited area of coverage and leaves a lot of the plane exposed for enemy fighters to swoop in from. So best course of action is to get them on the Hampden's tail.

Should an enemy fighter move to engage the Hampden, do not try to outmanoeuvre it. Simply dive and go as low as possible while in gunner view and aim for the enemy's engine. Try and damage it or give it some critical damage to fend it off. If one is lucky it will burst into flames or the pilot be knocked out and it will be out of the battle for good.

==== Specific enemies worth noting ====
The planes to be feared are usually those that carry cannons or 12.7 mm machine guns. These kind of planes can easily cause heavy damage to the Hampden.
Planes like: [[P-400]], [[P-40 (Family)|P-40]], [[LaGG-3 (Family)|LaGG-3]], [[Ki-45 (Family)|Ki-45]] and [[J22-B]]. But those are not the only threats, since there are many more aircraft that will be a considerable threat to Hampden Mk I.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Third heaviest payload for its BR (behind the [[Ju 88 A-4]] and the [[Hampden TB Mk I]])
* Offensive machine gun can be useful for killing soft ground targets
* Back gunner makes short work of low tier planes
* Decent manoeuvrability for a bomber

'''Cons:'''

* Terrible roll rate
* Possibility to face planes with 20 mm cannons and 12.7 mm guns
* Vickers machine gun isn't very accurate
* Unlike the [[Hampden TB Mk I]] it cannot carry a torpedo
* Does not like to take battle damage
* No protection for pilot when enemy planes attack you head on
* Hits to the wings can start fuel tank fires due to all the fuel tanks being internally mounted in the wings
* Rear gunners' arc is very limited
* Carrying the largest payload option will slow the plane to a crawl

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Handley Page Hampden was the last and fastest twin-engined bomber of the "trio" during the Phoney War. It was designed to meet Air Ministry Specification B.9/32 which called for a faster, heavier, and more powerful bomber that would replace the existing Bristol Blenheim and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. The designer, G.V Vokert, designed an interesting prototype, designated HP.52. This plane was originally powered by Napier Sabre Dagger engines, but switched to the more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines. Originally the Hampden had two Vickers K gun in ventral and dorsal positions, which proved to be inadequate for daylight defence. This was then switched to two Vickers K guns with modifications. The Hampden had many nicknames, because of the slim, compact and cramped fuselage it was nicknamed the "Flying Suitcase". It was oddly similar in role and appearance to the German fast day-bomber [[Do 17 (Family)|Do 17]], which had the nickname "Flying Pencil".

RAF Squadron No.49 was the first to receive their new Hampdens. Bearing the brunt of early bombing raids on Europe. The Hampden proved no match for Luftwaffe fighters. It was subsequently switched to various night time operations, such as mine-laying, bombing raids on German soil, propaganda and torpedo bombing. Despite having great speed and manoeuvrability, the Hampden was declared obsolete and retired from service in 1942.
