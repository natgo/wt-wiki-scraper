== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].

The Hampden TB is a lend-lease Soviet bomber of British design, and plays much as standard tree Soviet bombers do. Its good performance and respectable payload can destroy a bombing point in one go, and still have some to spare. It can also carry a torpedo, making it an effective anti-carrier craft. However, it is not well equipped to defend itself, and as such suffers in up-tiers.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 9.5 mm Steel plate in front of pilot, top of fuselage.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 7.7 mm Browning machine gun, nose-mounted (300 rpg)

The four machine guns are arranged in bundles of two mounted on the underside of the upper wing. Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire with each other until empty.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|G.P. Mk.IV (250 lb)|G.P. Mk.IV (500 lb)|G.P. Mk.I (1,000 lb)|18 inch Mark XII (450 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 6 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,500 lb total)
* 2 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,000 lb total)
* 4 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (2,000 lb total)
* 4 x 1,000 lb G.P. Mk.I bombs (4,000 lb total)
* 1 x 450 mm 18 inch Mark XII torpedo
* 6 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (3,000 lb total)
* 4 x 1,000 lb G.P. Mk.I bombs + 2 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (5,000 lb total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)|Vickers K (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, dorsal turret (1,200 rpg)
* 1 x 7.7 mm Vickers K machine gun, nose turret (1,000 rpg)
* 2 x 7.7 mm Vickers K machine guns, ventral turret (1,350 rpg = 2,700 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This bomber is strictly that; a bomber. With a mediocre defensive armament and only a single offensive 7.7, engaging enemy aircraft is an absolute last resort. The lack of defensive capabilities, combined with the thin tail and wings, make the Hampden TB a fragile aircraft. Upon spawning, climb at a very shallow angle to increase your speed and altitude at the same time. When the bomb points are in range, level off and drop your load. This will make you significantly lighter and allow you to return to base extremely quickly. During this time, one must take care to avoid aircraft that will now be at your altitude. A shallow dive will allow a boost in speed, and a corkscrew over the airfield will let you drop the remaining altitude without ripping due to speed.

====Specific enemies worth noting====
<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->

Any vehicle with an offensive armament of more than machine guns will shred the Hampden. Flak can be very dangerous due to the fragility of the aircraft, and the large glass nose almost always results in your forward gunner dying when engaging enemy units. All in all, avoid any contact with enemy vehicles.

====Counter-tactics====
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->
For its BR, the Hampden is quite fast at altitude. It can turn well at lower speeds, but this feature should not be utilized if you're being engaged. The most effective method of escaping combat is to run, ditching your bombs if absolutely necessary. Its bottom and forward gunners can deal with unarmoured aircraft, but will struggle against anything with a small amount of armour. There is, however, a Berezin UB machine gun in the top rear turret that can effectively deal with most fighters if needed.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Carries a large payload for rank I aircraft
* Offensive machine gun can be useful for killing soft ground targets and fighters
* Top rear gunner makes short work of low tier planes
* Good speed and overall manoeuvrability for a bomber
* Can carry a torpedo for anti-shipping runs

'''Cons:'''

* Roll rate is to be expected of a fast bomber
* Cannons obliterate the airframe easily
* Vickers K machine guns lack accuracy
* British torpedoes require a low drop speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The Handley Page Hampden was the last and fastest twin-engined bomber of the aircraft designed to meet Air Ministry Specification B.9/32. Which called for a faster, heavier, and more powerful bomber that would replace the existing Bristol Blenheim and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. The designer, G.V Vokert, designed an interesting prototype, designated HP.52. This plane was originally equipped with Napier Sabre Dagger engines, but switched to the more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines. Originally the Hampden had two Vickers K gun in ventral and dorsal positions, which proved to be inadequate for daylight defense. This was then switched to two Vickers K gun with modifications. The Hampden had many nicknames because of the slim, compact, and cramped fuselage. It was often nicknamed the "Flying Suitcase". Oddly similar in role and appearance to the German fast day-bomber Do 17, which had the nickname the "Flying Pencil".

RAF Squadron No.49 was the first to receive their new Hampdens. Bearing the brunt of early bombing raids on Europe, the Hampden proved no match for Luftwaffe fighters. It was subsequently switched to various night time operations, such as mine-laying, bombing raids on German soil, propaganda, and torpedo bombing. Despite having great speed and manoeuvrability, the Hampden was declared obsolete and retired from service in 1942.
