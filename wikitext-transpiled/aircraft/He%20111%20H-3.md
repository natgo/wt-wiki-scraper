== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The He 111 H-3 will often find itself in light vehicle battles due to its battle rating. The sole purpose of the He 111 H-3 is to destroy as many ground targets as it possibly can to aid in winning the match.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 10 mm Steel plate in the pilot's seat

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|SC50JA (50 kg)|SC250JA (250 kg)|Flam C 250 incendiary}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 32 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (1,600 kg total)
* 8 x 250 kg SC250JA bombs (2,000 kg total)
* 8 x Flam C 250 incendiary bombs

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, 2 x nose turret (375 rpg)
* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, dorsal turret (750 rpg)
* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, 2 x beam turret (375 rpg)
* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, 2 x ventral turret (375 rpg front-facing + 750 rpg rear-facing)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Upon spawning, you should put the plane into a slight climb, so it gains speed and altitude. Head immediately to nearest key ground targets. Ask your teammates to provide escort, the He 111 H-3 is quite durable and can absorb a lot of damage from a pursuing fighter but not several. Next, drop your payload into the targets. Here, it is better to use the 8 x Flam C 250 incendiary bombs, as they can easily take out multiple bases in a single run at this BR.

In battles without bases, it would be wise to immediately head toward and carpet bomb targets after spawning, either until you are dead or have destroyed all key targets in an area. Most of your adversaries won't be equipped with cannons, so if enemy fighters decide to attack you, you can act as a distraction while your teammates eliminate key targets.

In ground strike maps with tanks, equip the 8 x 250 kg bombs and either do high altitude base bombing or go for their tanks, ships or pillboxes. A bombing run with the 8 x 250 kg will be enough to destroy a bombing point, and a single direct hit from a 250 kg bomb will surely destroy any ground targets like pillboxes and heavy tanks. Lead the targets before dropping your bombs; it's not easy but becomes easier with practice. If you're not used to bombing moving targets, hit static ones like pillboxes.

You can do the same thing as stated for Arcade mode, which also works well in Realistic/Simulator Battles, or just go for bases with the 8 x 250 kg loadout. 2,000 kg will be enough to destroy a bombing point. Just ensure that you stay alive during your trip back to the base.

In Ground RB, carry the bomb load of 32 x 50 kg load out, as at your BR most enemies will be lightly armoured and only 2 or 3 bombs will be required to take them out. A good strategy when using this plane is to fly over enemy and allied capture points, as this is where most of your targets will be. Use your bombsight to pinpoint targets on the ground, then bombs away! Remember not to spend all your bombs on one target which is what most beginner pilots will do in this plane. Instead, drop around 5 bombs in a straight line near the target(s). Do this until your bomb load is exhausted.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Resilient against small arms fire, which is common at the rank
* Amazing stock bomb load of 32 x 50 kg bombs
* Good roll and turn rate for a bomber
* Decent speed
* Can carry an efficient maximum 2,000 kg of payload
* Defensive armament is decent against biplanes
* All payload options are internal
* Provides a very good learning curve to the next H-6 and H-16 models

'''Cons:'''

* Defensive armament is inadequate against planes when up-tiered
* Like all He 111 models, it suffers from poor gunner placements
* Cannot dive bomb like the [[Ju 88 A-4]]
* Has a cockpit made almost entirely of glass, which provides almost no protection for the pilot
* Tail controls can be easily damaged
* Cannons with high explosive filler are a threat

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
First appearing in November 1939, the He 111 H3 was intended for level bombing as well as anti-shipping work. The type was supplied to Romania and also license-built in that country. The subsequent H-4 and 5 variants were powered by improved engines and featured increased bomb loads.<ref>Green, William. Warplanes of the Third Reich. New York: Galahad Books, 1990</ref>

The Heinkel He 111 was a German monoplane medium bomber (also torpedo bomber and attack bomber). The He 111 H-3 entered production in November 1939 and could also be used in a naval bomber role. However, its defensive armament was not particularly effective, with limited defensive arcs and a very low rate of fire of only 540 rounds per minute.

The He 111 H-3 had a crew of five, but when used in a maritime role, this would usually be increased to six. The bomber was powered by Jumo 211 D-1 engines with a takeoff power of 1,200 HP. Up to 2,000 kg of bombs could be housed in the bomb bay; the left section of the bay could also house extra fuel tanks.
