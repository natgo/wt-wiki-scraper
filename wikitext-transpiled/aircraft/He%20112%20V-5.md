== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The He 112 V-5 is best used in lower altitudes. Even without diving down to the enemy to gain speed, it's a very good turn-fighter and has very good energy retention. It has very weak protection and armament, but you will most likely face with biplanes, so you will easily rip off their wings. The 7.92 mm ammo has a very simple ballistic trajectory, so its a very good plane to learn how to play in Realistic Battles (RB).

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The He 112 V-5 has no armour protection, but the fuel tanks are self-sealing. All the major modules are located in the nose and wing roots of the plane. This means the pilot and major modules have very little protection, although from the front the engine can absorb shots before the injure the pilot.

- No armour protection
- Self-sealing fuel tank

{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|MG 17 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

Both machine guns are arranged with one gun on each side of the fuselage, forward of the pilot, mounted beside the engine. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that both guns will fire together until empty. The He 112 V-5 may suffer in uptiers with only 2 x 7.92 MGs as armament.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:Cockpit_He112V5.jpg|thumbnail|right|The He 112's instrument panel.]]
The He 112 V-5 is a very good turn fighter. The elliptical gull wings allow it to turn just like the Spitfire. It carries the same engine used in the early Junkers Ju 87, but it performs badly above 3,000 m. Only use M.E.C. if you know what are you doing.

After takeoff, stay at an altitude where you want and gain some speed. Only go above 3,000 m if it is necessary. Only use M.E.C. if you practice it with the engine in test flights, any bad movement with M.E.C. can kill your engine within a few seconds. Once you have found an enemy, make a short burst to its wings as the 7.92 mm ammo will rip the wings off easily if you accurately place your rounds on target. If you overshoot the enemy, cut your throttle a bit down, your performance will not change too much.

==== Counter-tactics ====

<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->

If you stay above 3,000 m, you should not need to worry about them as the He 112 V-5 engine does not do well above that altitude. If you are below 3,000 m, try to turn-fight with them if you have a more manoeuvrable aircraft, if not, try to gain some distance and go for a Boom & Zoom attack against them. If you carry one of the dreaded .50 calibre machine guns, line up a shot and make some precise bursts to deal with the He 112 V-5.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Can perform well enough at almost any role
- Agile
- Has flaps

'''Cons:'''

- Poor maximum altitude
- Open and exposed cockpit
- No match for most fighters at the same rank
- Poor armament

Heinkel He.112V5 single-engine front-line fighter, issued 1936.

A single-seat all-metal monoplane fighter with an enclosed cockpit and a retractable landing gear system including tail wheel. This aircraft was designed in the Heinkel Flugzeugwerke design bureau by the brothers Walter and Siegfried Günter.

The aircraft was built for a single-seat fighter monoplane competition announced by Hermann Goering in May 1934. The He.112's main competitor in this competition was another famous German aircraft designer's creation: the Messerschmitt Bf.109V.

The first prototype He.112V1 fighter made its first flight on September 1, 1935. The experts of the Reich's Ministry of Aviation were unable to select just one prototype, so Messerschmitt and Heinkel were given orders for 15 pre-production machines, to be deployed for military trials. Based on the test results, the Bf.109 fighter was adopted by the Luftwaffe in the summer of 1936.

It was decided that the He.112 would be kept as a backup in case, for some reason, production of the Bf.109 had to be stopped. Construction of the 15 pre-production vehicles continued. The designers continued their work, making changes and improvements here and there in the plane's construction.

The next prototype He.112V5 was equipped with an inline 12-cylinder liquid-cooled Junkers Jumo.210D engine with a takeoff power of 680 hp and a two-bladed metal Junkers-Hamilton variable-pitch propeller. The aircraft was armed with two synchronous 7.92-mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG.17 machine guns with 500 rounds per gun, which were installed on the sides of the forward fuselage.

The aeroplane's wing shape was significantly modified. It now had a sharp bend in its leading edge and rounded tips.

The company's head, Ernst Heinkel, decided to show the prototype He.112V5 to the international market. In the spring of 1937, the aircraft was shown to a Japanese naval delegation, sent to Germany to learn about prospective future developments in aviation technology. The Japanese showed interest in the aircraft and decided to obtain a prototype for more detailed study and testing. In March 1937, an He.112V5 was sent to Japan by sea.

In the Land of the Rising Sun, the fighter was delivered to the Technical Commission of the Imperial Navy and designated the A7He1. Together with two other pre-production aircraft, the He.112A-05 (Wr.N.1959) and the He.112A-06 (Wr.N.1960) - also acquired by the Japanese Navy - the He.112V5 underwent tests to compare it to the carrier-based Mitsubishi A5M4 fighter. Japanese experts appreciated certain features of the design, such as the in-line engine and innovations like the retractable landing gear, but they decided not to order a large batch of planes. Primarily, the military did not like the fighter's relatively poor armament.
