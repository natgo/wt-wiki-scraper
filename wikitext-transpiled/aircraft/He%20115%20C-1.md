== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 15 mm cannon does decent damage for its BR
* Is quite durable, can take many MG rounds to take down
* Can fly back on 1 engine, although careful management of WEP is required

'''Cons:'''

* Poor speed and manoeuvrability, many fighters at its BR can catch up to if it descends from bomber altitude
* Poor defensive protection
* Major blindspots in defensive coverage, especially below the aircraft
* Poor dive speed, can rip its wing easily

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
