=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 15 mm steel - bulkhead behind cockpit
* Engine exposed on top of the fuselage
* Fuel tanks in fuselage and wings below the engine

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

"Offensive 20 mm", "Compressor", "Wings repair", then "Engine", is the recommended order of unlocking. Why? The stock MG 151 belts are bad as they lack the very powerful HE ''Minengeschosse''. Compressor and Engine are no-brainers. Everything that improves acceleration is a must for early jets. Wings repair is superior to new cannons, the stock MG 151 does not overheat and accuracy is acceptable in short bursts.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, chin-mounted (120 rpg = 240 total)

The twin MG 151s are one of the weaker cannons equipped by the early Rank 5 jets. However, when compared to the 30 mm Mk. 108s found on other German jets, its cannons have acceptable muzzle velocity, though this will remain a problem. The ammo count is less than enough considering the speeds at which jet combat takes place.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This aircraft is best used exclusively for Boom & Zoom attacks and fighting at high altitudes (over 5 km).

It bleeds energy fast in dogfights against early jets, and when matched with propeller planes, dogfights become suicide. Head-ons may seem like a good idea due to the plane's small size and powerful 20 mm cannons, but keep in mind that most of the time you will be fighting American or British aircraft, which will often one-shot or severely damage you with their multiple sets of .50 cals or Hispanos.

He 162 is an excellent bomber hunter, especially if you choose to fly with minimum (8 min) fuel and go to intercept bombers attacking your team's bases. Your 20 mm and small size will make you a deadly opponent, but keep in mind that most propeller bombers at this rank have great defensive armaments. When up-tiered with jets you will probably never see a bomber in-game.

When attempting to Boom & Zoom enemy fighters, it is vital that you climb at least 1 km above the enemy. Try climbing along the corners of the map, as if you go head-on you'll run into fighters without the energy you need to get away. Avoid sharp turns when diving and pulling up as you lose energy very fast in this aircraft. This becomes even more important when up-tiered, as enemy jets at higher battle-ratings have no problem catching up to you just long enough to destroy you.

The best place for He 162 is combined battles, where it has relatively low SP requirements and does not face a large group of enemy fighters. In this mode fly with a minimum tank load (8 min) as it's all you need and it gives you agility. Just as in air realistic, use Boom & Zoom to shoot down enemies ground attacking your team or unsuspecting enemy fighters.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* One of the best climbing early jets
* Faces almost only propeller-powered aircraft and some early jets
* Great manoeuvrability at high speed
* Good acceleration for an early jet at speeds below 800 km/h
* Excellent shallow dive rate
* Hard-hitting armament of two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons that fires Minengeschoß shells
* Small wing surface area means difficult target to shoot down
* Very good visibility
* Does not have war emergency power, however, the throttle can push up to 108%
* Relatively good bomber hunter, especially if the opponent lacks defensive armaments
* Can use its 108% throttle almost indefinitely above 6,000 m
* Great roll rate

'''Cons:'''

* Above 800 km/h, acceleration in straight line is almost non-existent
* Not beginner-friendly
* Suitable only for energy fighting, loses all energy in turns
* Bad manoeuvrability at low speed
* Very fragile even for a jet, a little damage can cause significant performance loss
* Limited amount of ammunition
* Limited energy retention due to bad high-speed engine performance and a lightweight airframe
* Setting throttle above 100% does not bring significant gain of power
* Armour protecting the pilot insufficient to prevent knock-out
* Difficulty with take-off, struggles on some airfields
* Extended usage of the throttle over 100% burns out the jet engine (deteriorates quality of use until its own destruction)
* Engine mounted on top, vertical manoeuvre techniques need to account for the pitching-down moment of the engine thrust
* Engine easily overheats below 2,000 m
* Poor performance when stock

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

Initially, this Heinkel fighter was designated He 500, but by October, in order to fool enemy intelligence services, the RLM redesignated the plane He 162; the number being previously assigned to a Messerschmitt fast bomber prototype that competed with the Ju 88. At the same time, the fighter was named the Salamander, which initially was the codename for the very same fast bomber design. The official name at the start of introduction was '''Volksjäger''' to emphasize the usage as "every man's fighter" similar to Volkswagen aka VW.

Overall 170 to 320 aircraft were produced, most of them A-2 variants. The previous A-1 were first fitted with Mk108, but these shocked the airframe too hard and were changed into the less recoil-heavy MG 151/20. An interesting feature is the dorsal mounted engine. It serves two purposes; first: Easier maintenance like with Me 262s underwing gondolas and second - and most importantly: The high installation greatly reduced foreign object damage - or FOD. Unpaved runways were common on all sides in WW2 and rocks and other debris were often sucked into the intake -- the main cause of engine failures in early jets.

Albeit named the Volksjäger, the jet was a dangerous vehicle for beginners. Short flight time and a high stall speed compared to the gliders most recruits trained on caused a high after-combat crash rate, especially on landing approaches. Pilots often failed to attain the recommended landing speed of 250 km/h (100 more than the Bf 109) due either inexperience or lack of fuel. The high landing speed was the cause of even more deadly problems.

In the air, however, the aircraft was praised even by its foes. Allied pilots loved to take the captured He 162s into the air, praising its smooth flight and good controllability. The only downside was the weak rudder and weak in the literal meaning. RAF pilot, Flt Lt. R. A. Marks, despite being instructed not to use heavy rudder on high speed, performed a low-altitude, high-speed barrel roll during a demonstration. A fin and rudder assembly ripped out of its socket, the sudden loss of control and insufficient height resulted in a fatal crash.

Like the Me 262 Schwalbe, the Volksjäger proved to be too little too late.
