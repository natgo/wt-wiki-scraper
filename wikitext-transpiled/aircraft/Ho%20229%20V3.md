== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].

The Ho 229 V3 is the first jet in the "Zerstörer" tech tree of the Luftwaffe and currently comes before the [[G.91 R/3]]. Ironically, it goes against much of the doctrine set by the previous planes, favouring speed and manoeuvrability over armament and durability.

Something that will immediately stand out with the Ho 229 V3 is how incredibly manoeuvrable it is compared to most other jet fighters. The Ho 229 V3 can almost quite literally turn on a dime and can even in some circumstances out-turn late super props such as the [[P-51H-5-NA|P-51H]] if manoeuvred correctly. However, if its manoeuvrability is used to its full extent, it also causes the plane to bleed speed at a crippling rate, making a sustained turn fight impossible to win. As such, it is advised to use the Ho 229 V3 as a Boom & Zoom fighter in order to maintain airspeed and altitude. Remember that jet engines' efficiency is directly proportional to the IAS, due to the increased air intake, meaning the Ho 229 V3 will be accelerating very slowly between 0-500 km/h, but beyond will be able to outrun any propeller-driven aircraft.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

An obvious flaw of the Ho 229 is the large surface area created by the flying wing design. This means that is it easier for enemies to land a shot on the plane. It can be countered by turning the side of your plane towards the enemy, henceforth decreasing the surface area that can be shot.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Given the Horten's weight, the acceleration is an issue on the stock plane. Go for ammunition, engine and compressor upgrades first.

After that, any upgrade is equally good. Weapon upgrades can wait, as the Mk 103 is the best gun in-game, with high accuracy and long bursts stock. The belts also shouldn't be a priority unless using the Ho 229 as an attacker. In that case, the "Armoured targets" belt is very useful against tanks & light pillboxes.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|MK 103 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 30 mm MK 103 cannons, wing-mounted (170 rpg = 340 total)

====Ammunition====

- '''Default:''' {{Annotation|HEI-T|High-explosive incendiary tracer (minengeschoß)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|I|Incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}}; okay against planes.
- '''Armoured targets:''' {{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|I|Incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}}; the armoured target belt is different for the Ho 229 V3, compared to all other Mk 103 armed aircraft, and is only a 1/2 as effective, due to the belt being filled with incendiary shells.
- '''Air targets:''' {{Annotation|HEI-T|High-explosive incendiary tracer (minengeschoß)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEI|High-explosive incendiary (minengeschoß)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEI|High-explosive incendiary (minengeschoß)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|I|Incendiary}}; each Minengeschoß (mine-shell) has the same HE power as a 37 mm round, wonderful against anything that flies and light ground targets.
- '''Stealth:''' {{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}}; difficult to use; cannot destroy most tanks nor pillboxes, lacks the destructive force of HE shells against planes.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:FighterImage_Ho-229Vunknown.jpg|thumbnail|Horten 229 Version 3 with its wings attached by the USAF in 1950.]]
The Horten 229 flying wing is a dogfighter, heavy-fighter, or even an attacker.

Its single wing design allows for amazing manoeuvrability despite its weight of up to 8 tonnes, when equipped with full fuel load. This is, however, the Horten's literal downfall; the weight. Its acceleration is awful, even for jets. But the energy retention is great and climb acceptable. With that in mind rule number one of jet battle comes into play: do not turnfight! The 229 will tempt anyone though. The low wing loading for a jet and even some piston planes allows for tight turning circles. Being heavy also allows to keep that velocity well in the initial turns, but with the inability to regain that speed afterwards... leads to a flaming wreck thanks to an opportunistic enemy. The classic dogfight is thus only for emergency situations!

As a fighter, stick with Boom & Zoom, in which the Ho 229's heavy weight is of assistance in zoom climbs. However, it will also dampen the Horten's starting acceleration in a dive, making out diving an enemy difficult. The bad roll rate makes it hard to get some shots on target, But watch out! Don't pull too hard on the elevator to get that shot, or the Horten will lose much speed (which cannot be regained quickly) or rarely, lose a wing.

The heavy fighter role equals the fighter one in every aspect, just that the targets are usually bombers. Stay fast, and try to get shots off in head-ons, or in slight diving turns from the bomber's six (tail), to make it difficult for the defensive gunners to hit the Ho 229.

The attacker role is a dangerous one. The Ho 229 will have to fly slow, in order to have time to properly aim, hit & evade trees. While all of these aren't difficult in the Horten 229 V3, it leaves the plane in a dangerous spot: low and without speed. Both are vital though for the sluggish plane. In this role, be sure to have good escort fighters, as enemies can come at any time in jet combat.

Once the Horten is fully upgraded, or at least the performance parts are, one detail to notice is that the wings won't rip so easily like before, but the Ho 229 still has to turn cautiously, because it is still a wooden plane after all.

Perhaps the most dangerous enemy of the Horten 229 is the F-84 Thunderjet. Since the Thunderjet gets an air spawn it already has all the energy it needs to get around the map quickly. There are occasions when players spawn in late, only to be strafed by an F-84 Thunderjet on the runway. The Ho-229 is decent at accelerating once up to about 550 km/h, past that point, the Ho 229 becomes a V2 rocket in terms of acceleration until about ~750-800 km/h, then there will be a hard time accelerating again.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Excellent armament, MK 103 is one of the best guns in the game
- Great ammunition supply with 170 rounds per gun
- Low wing loading, incredibly good at turning when flown at medium speeds (400-600 km/h)
- Good energy retention if not manoeuvred too harshly
- Outruns piston-engine aircraft and all Allied jets, except for the F-84 Thunderjet when up-tiered
- Low stall speed of 165 km/h
- Fast when diving if flown at medium to high speeds before committing to a dive
- The air brake can bleed airspeed efficiently

'''Cons:'''

- Acceleration is slow- even its initial acceleration in a dive
- Only 2/4 of its armoured target belt is comprised of HVAP-T shells, unlike other MK 103 equipped aircraft, which have only HVAP-T shells
- Is easy to hit when turning, above, or below because of the size
- Easy to destroy wings in hard turns at high speed
- Terrible yaw rotation
- Poor roll rate - Significantly hinders the ability to counter defensive scissors
- Slow rate of fire results in occasional misses when sweeping quickly behind enemies if aiming at wings, which have a thin profile
- Have to land slow, cause of the lack of brakes
- Loses speed quickly in elevator turns
- Gets matched against enemy jets that have superior performance
- The cannons have a large dispersion cone.

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

In the 1930s, the Horten Brothers were really interested by the concept of "flying wing" for the potential of drag reduction.

In 1943, Marshal Hermann Göring requested a plane that could carry a 1,000 kg bomb load to a range of 1,000 km at a speed of 1,000 km/h. Because jet engines of the time had poor efficiency, the Horten Brothers thought putting them in a flying wing, which had reduced drag, was the solution.

The Horten Brothers proposed their project for a bomber, Ho IX, but the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) thought the plane would be better as a jet fighter than a long range bomber and requested that two MK 103 cannons were mounted. The result was the prototype Ho 229.

Only one example of a Ho 229 V3 was in final phase of assembly at the end of the war, and sent on to the United States by the allies.

The Ho 229 had three prototypes before the facility was overrun.
[[File:FighterImage_Draeger suit from the side.jpeg|thumb|right|Pilot with Draeger suit in Ho 229]]

# '''V1''' was a glider to test the design.

# '''V2''' was a down-scaled prototype fitted with the Jumo 004B.

# '''V3''' was a testbed for serial production, it was however not completely finished when the US Army arrived.

Originally the V3 was intended to have the Jumo 004C jet engines, these weren't ready though and the Me 262 A's 004B was installed. <!--(--~~~~14:12, 22 September 2014 (UTC) B-2, or B-4?).-->
The final production version would have had the ability to load bombs, switch the main armament to four [[MK 108 (30 mm)|MK 108]] and the pilots were to be equipped with the Draeger pressure suit ([[G-Suit]]).
