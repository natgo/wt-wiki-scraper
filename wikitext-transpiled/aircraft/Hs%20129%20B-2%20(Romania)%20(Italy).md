== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a premium pack vehicle in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] for War Thunder's [[wt:en/news/5852-special-news-war-thunder-s-birthday-discounts-and-gifts-en|6th Anniversary]] as a replacement for the [[Hs 129 B-2 (Romania)|German Tech Tree version of the vehicle]]..

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Hs 129's flight characteristic is somewhat similar to the Soviet [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]] ground attack aircraft. The plane suffers from an underpowered engines which limits its acceleration and climb rate, but the Hs 129 can fly pretty well with enough speed, and has the ability to perform hard manoeuvres in flight even at low altitude. However, the plane cannot roll at all due to the engines lack output to prevent the plane from stalling, as well as bleeds a lot of energy away in any air-to-air engagements.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The plane is very heavy, which makes it nearly impossible to take out fighters (unless the fighters come to the Hs 129 B-2, see below), even most medium bombers are more manoeuvrable, however the plane is heavily armoured, so it can last a while even under heavy fire, even to such a degree that some planes run out of ammunition before taking out a Henschel. That combined with the heavy armament makes it ideal to attack B-17 formations, even though it requires time and effort to climb and match the speed of the formation. The armour around the cockpit makes it nearly immune to 7.92 mm rounds and could also fly with one engine, albeit with great difficulty. The planes incredibly stable flight behaviour makes aiming even for joystick pilots very easy and accurate thus not wasting too much ammunition.

Once the 30 mm additional gun with its impressive 100-round belt has been researched (the 37 mm with its smaller belt and low rate of fire should be avoided), the plane has very heavy firepower. In combination with the great stability and thus firing accuracy, this makes it an ideal heads-on fighter. With a bit of experience, it's relatively easy to finish off enemy fighters with one or two short bursts before they are even in range for the target indicator to appear. In situations where enemy planes coming at 0.5 to 1.0 km interval from the same direction, the Hs 129 B-2 can easily achieve triple or even quadruple air victories before needing to turn around for reloading.

==== Tactics ====
Using the 30 mm MK 103, which can be unlocked as an additional armament option, the Hs 129 B-2 is capable of destroying most mission relevant ground targets. Tanks of all sorts, as well as light pillboxes, can be destroyed in up to three hits, provided armour piercing ammunition (HVAP-T) is unlocked. Thanks to the 100 rounds of ammunition available, this can make a single Hs 129B-2 a game-changing aircraft. The same can be achieved using the BK 3.7, however, it is generally considered harder to use and thus not a viable option.

The Hs 129 B-2, however, does have major drawbacks. Its engines are weak which results in poor top speed, acceleration and climb rate. This, combined with the armour of nearly one-ton weight, makes it perform poorly in air combat and very vulnerable to attacks of enemy fighters. This, however, goes so far that sometimes enemy pilots underestimate the Hs 129 and overshoot it after a tight turn, which gives the Hs 129B-2 pilot a moderate chance of defending itself.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

[[Yak-2 KABB]] - Do not think that the Hs 129 B-2 can confidently outmanoeuvre this plane just because it is twin-engined. The Yak-2 has an amazing turn rate for a heavy fighter, thus the Hs 129 B-2 must avoid turning with it, if not dogfighting with it in general. It bears a pair of ShVAK cannons that can easily damage vital parts like engine or cooling systems. It has green camo, greatly resembling an Me 410 but with an H-tail like a Bf 110's.

[[ZSD63]] - A deadly enemy to face in Tank Realistic Battles. Though it is hard to identify specific SPAA vehicles on the ground (especially when they are shooting tracers at the plane), if a ZSD63 is identified, avoid it at all costs and do not attempt head-ons with it, ever. It can easily snap a wing off by causally putting a short burst in the Hs 129 B-2's flight path. Don't even get close to it unless it is occupied with another friendly or if the Hs 129 B-2 is equipped with a bomb that it can use. The Hs 129 B-2's 30 mm / 37 mm cannons in the secondary armaments cannot effectively damage it as its hull is overall quite empty, causing your shells to do little to no damage. Some identifying features of the ZSD63 is its rather boxy and tall hull with a geometric turret sitting at the back, slightly similar to a Wirbelwind's. The firing manner is also distinctive: the sound and green tracers are very rapid, much like a buzz saw, but then it will remain silent for half a minute reloading. Note that an experienced ZSD player will hold its fire or shoot in single salvoes with long halts between, making it look like that it's reloading. Armour piercing belt is recommended since their high penetration can tear through the ZSD's armour with ease and knock out its crews.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Sturdy airframe with armour and thick bulletproof glass, can take some punishment before going down
* Very good firepower when carrying either the 30 mm or 37 mm cannon pods
** 30 mm MK 103 is a high-velocity cannon with a decent rate of fire, which allows for versatility in targets, and is especially devastating against armoured vehicles
** 30 mm HVAP-T generally destroys air targets in one to three hits with a high potential to combust targets
** 30 mm HE-I/HEI-T Minengeschoß in the default belts means grinding once the 30 mm is available isn't that difficult
** 30 mm has a reasonable ammo pool of 100 rounds and the low fire rate combined with hit success allows it more than enough to obtain down five planes before running out
* Surprisingly manoeuvrable at higher speed
* Cockpit has 70 mm of armoured glass at the front, reasonable all-round protection for the pilot
* Great at head-on passes in all game modes (shoot and duck/roll away)
* Centrally mounted armament, need for gun harmonisation minimalized

'''Cons:'''
* Extremely underpowered engines plagued the overall flight performances
** Poor acceleration and energy retention
** Poor climb rate, bad manoeuvrability at lower speed
** Cannot roll at all due to the risk of stalling
** If even one engine is shot-up, the plane will fall from the sky
** Engine uses a carburettor, preventing prolonged inverted G-load state
* Has no defensive armament compared to other attack aircraft of its rank
* Engine and internal wing fuel tanks are ideal targets for enemy pilots
* Needs the gun pods to do well
* Thick cockpit armoured glass causes some distortion (Simulator)

At the start of WW2 Romania had adopted a position of neutrality. However following the Soviet Annexation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in June - July 1940, the loss of Northern Transylvania to Hungary on 30 August 1940, and the loss of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria on 7 September 1940 the popularity of the Romanian government plummeted. This led to a series of government changes, followed by a Coup and the instalment of Ion Antonescu as the country's leader. Antonescu promptly got Romania to join the Tripartite Pact on 23 November, becoming allied with Nazi Germany.<ref name="Williamson1">Williamson 2017 I</ref>

Becoming allies with Nazi Germany gave Romania access to German aircraft. It is reported that Romania received Hs 129 A series aircraft.<ref name="Kretaner">Kretaner n.d.</ref> The Hs 129 A was known for being extremely underpowered with its Argus As 410 engines, and B series aircraft were soon produced with more powerful Gnome-Rhône 14M radial engines. Romania received the latest Hs 129 B-2 version in June 1943; and they were put to use against Soviet forces on the Eastern Front<ref name="Joseph">Joseph 2012</ref>. The Romanian Hs 129 B-2s typically carried a 30 mm cannon under the fuselage, and proved to be very effective in the ground attack role, reportedly "bringing Soviet tank and infantry attacks to a halt time and again".<ref name="Joseph"/> On 23 August 1944 after Romania had been suffering heavy losses against the advancing Soviet forces King Michael I of Romania ordered Antonescu to surrender. When Antonescu refused the king had him arrested and declared war on Nazi Germany, joining the Soviet advance.<ref name="Williamson2">Williamson 2017 II</ref> It is unclear if the Hs 129s were used against Germany.

One Romanian ace to fly the Hs 129 was Teodor Zăbavă, who achieved four air-to-air kills in his Hs 129 (and more in his IAR 80). One kill occurred on 25 October 1943 against a Soviet Yak fighter.<ref name="Bernad">Bernad 2012</ref>
