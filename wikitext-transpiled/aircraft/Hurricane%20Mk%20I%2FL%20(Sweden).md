=== Survivability and armour ===

{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 8 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 2,800 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* 8 x 7.7mm MG are quite beginner-friendly to practice aim
* Excels at low-speed dogfighting, can effectively engage agile planes like [[Ki-43-I|Ki-43]]
* Also capable of Boom & Zoom tactics against energy fighters like [[Bf 109 E-1|Bf 109E]]
* Tracer belts are mostly made up of incendiary ammunition, which easily sets enemy planes on fire
* Great for simulator: clear view over the nose and is stable in a turn

'''Cons:'''

* rifle-calibre machine gun has low damage against robust targets like [[F4U (Family)|F4U]], [[Ju 88 (Family)|Ju-88]]
* Only has 2,800 bullets, so careful shot placement is crucial in realistic and simulator battles
* Combat flaps will rip at relatively low speeds (>270 km/h)
* Slow level flight speed compared to other aircraft like [[Bf 109 F-1|Bf 109 F]], [[Ki-61-I ko|Ki-61]]
* Lacklusture roll rate against planes like [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw-190A]]
