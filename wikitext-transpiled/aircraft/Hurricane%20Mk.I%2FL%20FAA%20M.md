== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Raining Fire"]] as a reward for  the [[wt:en/news/6866-special-80-year-anniversary-of-battle-of-britain-en|2020 "80<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Battle of Britain"]] event.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Hurricane Mk.I/L FAA M is a bit more sluggish in movement and turning than its brethren the [[Spitfire (Family)]] but is not an plane to take lightly because its not as agile as the [[Spitfire (Family)]] it's still a very manoeuvrable plane and a good dogfighter, having a top speed of 550km/h makes it not the fastest fighter of its BR, but combined with its manoeuvrability makes it a plane to be wary of when facing it in combat. Its manoeuvrability and Speed is not the greatest, it can feel a bit sluggish at low speed and can lock up quite easily at high speed, but when it's at an average speed it can perform very well for a plane, it can hold its own against enemies. Its Strength is that it can get up to a decently speed and it can turn very well compared to other some of the other nations fighters.

* 8 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 2,800 total)

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

The strong, sturdy wings on the Hurricane make for an excellent gun platform for pilots. So whilst it may lack the punch of cannons or heavier machine guns, you will find the Hurricane's agility and ability to put accurate fire on targets to be in your favour. The standard "Hawker" style wide track landing gear present on most, if not all of their monoplane fighters is, of course, found on the Hurricane Mk I/L FAA M as well, making this aircraft much more appealing to newer players when landing due to its stability.

In combat the Hurricane Mk I/L  FAA M allows pilots to engage almost any aircraft comfortably. Many of the fighters you will face do not have the agility to outmanoeuvre the Hurricane, which will only be surpassed by any biplanes or Japanese fighters you may face. Lone fighter-bombers, attackers, heavy fighters and bombers should also present little threat to the Hurricane as its 8 machine guns provide a dense spread of fire at a fast rate, whilst the rigidity and durability of the airframe will cope with the return fire of the opposing aircrafts' gunners.

The Hurricane Mk.I have eight .303 calibre machine guns, four in each wing. However, unlike the [[Spitfire Mk Ia|Spitfire]], the Hurricane's guns are all in a single group, so it provides a better firing platform than the Spitfire by allowing its firepower to be concentrated.

The rate of fire and the subsequent lack of ammo are an important issue to keep in mind. It is easy to deplete the entire ammo with a long burst. ''Trigger discipline'' is the key here! Furthermore, the Hurricane's heavy weight, due to its old-fashioned tube chassis (unlike the more modern Spitfire with its nutshell chassis design), results in good vertical energy retention, allowing the plane to perform Boom & Zoom manoeuvres with great success. Utilise them as the standard form of fighting in both modes, as unlike in Arcade, regaining energy and speed after a turn fight takes rather long, leaving you vulnerable to fighters who didn't join the conflict earlier.

====Counter-tactics====
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->
Countering the Hurricane almost completely depends on what kind of plane you are flying. If you see a Hurricane there are three things to remember: It is extremely good at turning, very durable and it has 8 machine guns, which despite their small calibre are extremely deadly. It will be able to place you in its crosshairs very quickly and saturate you with rounds. The Hurricane Mk I/L FAA M is not without its weaknesses, however. It isn't particularly fast, doesn't dive very well and performs poorly at high altitude.

When countering the Hurricane, you must take these strengths and weaknesses into account and also your own. If your plane is faster than the Hurricane but does not turn as well, you should boom and zoom, diving on the Hurricane from altitude and strafing it as you speed by. In a successful attempt, you will destroy the Hurricane in one pass. However, if you miss or only cause minor damage you may need to make another pass. In no situation should you try to turn fight the Hurricane at this stage. You will bleed energy and it will easily out turn and destroy you. Instead, you should use the speed gained in the dive to climb away, leaving the Hurricane behind. When you have achieved an appropriate altitude and speed you can then turn back and make another pass. This kind of manoeuvre takes patience but is worth it when it comes to fighting the Hurricane. Impatience will only get you out-paced by the Hurricane and shot down. If you want to have a higher success rate with boom and zoom tactics, it is good to choose a well-armed plane. Something with cannons or high calibre machine guns should suffice. Planes like the [[Bf 109 E-3]], [[MiG-3-34]], [[LaGG-3-8]], [[P-36G]] and even attackers like the [[IL-2 (1941)]] are effective at boom and zoom tactics on the Hurricane.

Some planes can also turn fight the Hurricane. Most biplanes should have equal or better turning capabilities than the Hurricane. An inexperienced/impatient Hurricane pilot may try to out turn a biplane, usually resulting in disaster. However, biplanes are slower. They will often find experienced Hurricane pilots performing tactics like the above-mentioned boom and zoom where the Hurricane can use its higher speed to climb away after a pass. There are also some monoplanes that can out turn a Hurricane. The [[I-16 (Family)|I-16]] will definitely challenge the Hurricane and so will the Japanese [[Ki-27 otsu]] and [[A5M4]]. However, similar to biplanes, they are slow and in the case of the Japanese very poorly armed.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Exceptional manoeuvrability, on par with biplanes
* Very high number of guns
* Plenty of ammo
* Takes off very quickly
* Perfect for dog fighting
* Quite good at Boom & Zoom once altitude is achieved
* Half of Tracers belt is AP-I ammunition
* Premium bonuses
* Excellent over-the-nose visibility ensures easy tracking and leading in cockpit view
* Is a stable gun platform with very smooth handling with simulator controls

'''Cons:'''

* Slower than most planes in its rank (especially at higher altitudes)
* Still only .303 (7.7 mm) MGs
* Dives do not accelerate the plane quickly
* Does not have a particularly good roll rate
* Machine guns can run out of ammo quickly without trigger discipline (critical for realistic and simulator battles)
