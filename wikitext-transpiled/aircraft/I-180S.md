== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]] as a reward for the 2019 [[wt:en/news/6145-special-battlefield-engineer-en|"Battlefield Engineer"]] event.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The I-180S is a quite a manoeuvrable aircraft at its BR, being able to turn better than many fighters of its tier.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm Steel - Pilot seat
* Large, single fuel tank in front of pilot
* Uncovered cockpit (no cockpit roof)

{{main|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine guns, nose-mounted (220 rpg = 440 total)
* 2 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, nose-mounted (650 rpg = 1,300 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

{{main|FAB-50sv (50 kg)|FAB-100sv (100 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 4 x 50 kg FAB-50sv bombs (200 kg total)
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (200 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

You can climb to about 4,000-5,000 m of altitude at the beginning of the battle and use Boom & Zoom tactic to get rid of some low-altitude enemies first. If there are any enemies above or at the same altitude as you, it is recommended to attempt to drag them into a dogfight. Head-on attacks are ill-advised against heavily armed and armoured planes such as the [[F4U (Family)|F4U Corsair]], [[P-40 (Family)|P-40 Warhawk]], and [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]] because the I-180S lacks armour around many critical components, including the pilot and fuel tank. The I-180S's armament seems to push the nose up a small amount, but good aim prevents this from being that much of an issue.

Although the I-180S is fairly manoeuvrable, there are some aircraft which can easily outturn it such as the British [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]] and Japanese [[A6M (Family)|A6M Zero]]. Both of these fighter types have an excellent turn rate which means that dogfighting, even against a mediocre pilot, will most likely result in them getting on your tail. A recommended strategy to combat these types is to try to gain an altitude advantage or do a head-on with a quick snap-turn to out-run them and return for another pass.

In RB/SB modes, the I-180S has a nasty habit of entering stalls at low speeds, especially when turnfighting with manual rudder and elevator controls - at which point, it falls like a rock for a few hundred metres. Daring pilots may be able to use this to their advantage to throw off pursuing planes, but be careful not to end up crashing.

;Manual activation

* For those who manually activate the gearing, switch to second gear around 3,500 m and drop the drop climb angle to 10-12 degrees which will make most effective use of the aircraft's engine and supercharger.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great all-round fighter, a bit of turn fighter, a bit of Boom & Zoomer
* Excellent climb rate due to supercharger
* Small size means small target
* Great manoeuvrability
* Great roll rate
* Excellent armament packed tightly in the nose of the aircraft, making it easy to aim
* Can carry bombs for ground attack

'''Cons:'''

* Engine tends to overheat, must be careful with WEP
* Poor rudder control, difficult to perform wing-overs or hammerhead manoeuvres
* Underarmoured for its tier
* Damage to the wings, control surfaces, or engine modules can unbalance the aircraft and or cripple performance 

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Development of the I-180 began in 1938, with the Polikarpov design bureau starting work on creating a new aircraft to meet the requirements of the Soviet Air Force at the time. In order to do so, engineers decided to base the new machine on a modified I-16 design and to install a more powerful radial engine. As a result, the I-180 was created. However, development and testing of prototypes was plagued with numerous issues, including many accidents. This, coupled with the arrival of new Soviet fighter designs quickly cast a shadow on the I-180 project which ultimately led to the project being cancelled by the end of 1940. Prior to the cancellation, a production version of the machine - the I-180S was built but only in very limited numbers. In total, around 13 I-180s were built, including prototypes, but none saw any active service.
