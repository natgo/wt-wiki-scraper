== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.47 "Big Guns"]].

The IL-2 1941 is the first [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-type strike aircraft]] a pilot will get in the Soviet aircraft tree. Players will quickly find out that this plane is very durable, but somewhat slow and unwieldy... although with some skill this plane can surprise attacking enemies. Players should research bombs and rockets as soon as they can, followed by ammo belts to augment your ground-attack role. This plane, as well as the following IL-type aircraft, have roughly the same base attributes you will find in the Pros and Cons below, with a few minor differences between models.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

For tactics, IL-2s are built to be close to the ground. Fly very low for IL-2 pilots in reality were known to skim treetops. Further try to stay out of sight of enemy planes. As tough as you are, you cannot take concentrated fire from enemy fighters, especially heavy fighters. As you near your target (about 3 km away) go into a slight climb, then nose down into a moderate dive toward your target. Imagine yourself gliding in, not diving. It is generally recommended that you use bombs first, as this will immediately lighten the plane and make you more manoeuvrable. Because the IL-2 flies so close to the ground, some pilots have destroyed themselves by bombing targets right under them. To avoid this, set the bomb fuses to around 2 seconds.

Use bombs against tanks and pillboxes, rockets against groups of light armoured vehicles (and occasionally enemy aircraft), and use your MGs/Cannons for AAA, Artillery, Armoured cars, and enemy aircraft. If you equip certain ammo belts, you may also be able to destroy pillboxes and light tanks with your primary guns alone! Experience gained with this aircraft will be invaluable for later models, who get larger cannons, rear gunners, and other handy upgrades.

Lastly, due to the extraordinary low-altitude style of the IL-2 line of planes, equipping a camouflage that matches the map actually helps in the Realistic/Simulator modes, as you need to get close to enemy planes before they become "spotted". Equipping a white camo on a winter map, then flying very low as the IL-2 is made to do, can help keep players from spotting you.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Heavy armament with large ammo capacity
- Well-armoured & durable
- Surprisingly manoeuvrable in turns with flaps and WEP, can outturn certain heavy fighters at its BR
- Diverse payload options allow for varied playstyles

'''Cons:'''

- Priority target for the enemy fighters as it is slow, big and has no rear gunner
- ShVAK cannons can not harm medium tanks as they lack penetration
- Limited view from cockpit due to armour plates (in Simulator)
- Large drop in flight performance compared to [[Yak-2 KABB|Yak-2]]

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The famous IL-2 Shturmovik was a Soviet WWII-era attack aircraft created by the Ilyushin Design Bureau and nicknamed ''Hunchback'' by Red Army troops due to the distinct fuselage shape. While the designers nicknamed their aircraft the ''Flying Tank'', Luftwaffe pilots, due to the IL-2's incredible ability to withstand battle damage, instead called it the ''Betonflugzeug'' (concrete plane). German ground troops, conversely, despised and feared the IL-2, giving it a slew of unpleasant nicknames, such as ''Schlachter'' (butcher); ''Fleischwulf'' (meatgrinder); ''eiserner Gustav'' (Iron Gustav) and ''schwarzer Tod'' (the black death). Some historians believe that the ''Black Death'' was actually a successful invention of the Soviet propaganda machine that caught on with the Germans.

The IL-2 was the most mass-produced military aircraft in history. However, early in the war German air superiority coupled with the absence of rear gunners on early variants and poorly organized Soviet fighter escorts led to high rates of losses for the type. A favourite attack tactic for IL-2 pilots was a low-level attack run, first letting loose with rockets at 600-700 m, then firing on-board armament from a distance of 400 to 600 m. Bombs would be dropped in subsequent passes from an altitude of 100-200 m, using an impact fuse. The recommended tactic for attacking concentrations of soft targets was a strafing run in a shallow dive from 100-200 m and a subsequent dropping of bombs at a low level when exiting the dive.
