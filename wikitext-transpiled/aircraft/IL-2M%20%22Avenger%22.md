== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/668--en|premium pack]] in [[Update_1.41#19.06.2014_-_1.41.27.12|Update 1.41.27]]. It was removed from the store after the 2016 clearance sale. It was again available briefly in the store during the [[wt:en/news/5232-shop-winter-sales-special-bundle-and-gift-certificates-en|2018 Winter Sale]] and has since been made available in-game for Golden Eagles ({{GE}}) for a limited time during the [[wt:en/news/5345-special-defender-of-the-fatherland-en|2018]], [[wt:en/news/6588-event-defender-of-the-fatherland-en|2020]], [[wt:en/news/7054-event-defender-of-the-fatherland-en|2021]], and [[wt:en/news/7568-special-esport-defender-tournament-and-gaijin-store-sale-en|2022]] "Defender of the Fatherland" mini-events.

The IL-2M "Avenger" is a premium variant of the [[IL-2M type 3]] [[:Category:Strike_aircraft|strike aircraft]]. It is an excellent variant of the [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]] series, a very well armoured aircraft, though somewhat little manoeuvrable and lacking in energy retention and as such it should avoid confronting fighter aircraft. However the offensive armament is nothing to be trifled with, the hitting power of the 23 mm cannons is more than enough to obliterate any enemy aircraft, but dogfighting should be left to purpose-designed fighters. It also has a rear gunner equipped with a 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, capable of dealing with any enemies attacking from the rear.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

Though the IL-2M models are improved with the better AM-38F engine, the {{PAGENAME}} is still sluggish due to the overall plane weight. Speed, maxed out around the 400 km/h range, mean many fighters are able to catch up and outpace the IL-2M and take it down on their terms. Acceleration is decent up until a speed of around 330 km/h before slowing down. Though WEP is available on the plane, it doesn't seem to help assist in acceleration very well.

The roll rate of the aircraft is particularly slow, which is exacerbated with wing-mounted weapons like rockets. Elevator and rudder response are up to par however and can be relied on for more responsive manoeuvres.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

[[File:ArmourScheme IL-2M.jpg|x250px|right|thumb|IL-2M armour scheme]]

- 6 mm Steel - Propeller ring
- 4 mm Steel - Armour plates surrounding engine compartment
- 6 mm Steel - Encasing oil cooler
- 5 mm Steel - Cockpit floor
- 6 mm Steel - Cockpit wall/canopy lining
- 12 mm Steel - Pilot/Gunner separating partition
- 4 mm Steel - Upper canopy behind pilot
- 6 mm Steel - Armour plate protecting rear gunner
- 64 mm Bulletproof Glass - Forward canopy

As can be seen by the list of armour types on the {{PAGENAME}}, the plane, like the other IL-series of attacker aircraft, has a capsule of armour surrounding the pilot and most of the plane's modules. While the thickness is not substantial, ranging between 4-5 mm of steel armour, they provide the engine, fuel tanks, and radiators a level of protection not typically enjoyed by other aircraft. The armour collectively also provides substantial protection to the pilot from the front, especially with a 64 mm thick bulletproof glass on the top and the collection of steel armour and modules below.

The pilot's rear armour is also quite substantial with more 6 mm armour platings. However, the crew partition armour of 12 mm combined with the gunner's rear 6 mm of armour means that while the gunner may be knocked out more easily by an enemy at a six o' clock, the pilot can enjoy some more levels of protection for sustained flying.

With the belly of the plane also considerably armoured, the only way to be able to attack the {{PAGENAME}}'s crew unimpeded is by attacking from above, where there are gaps in the armour for a direct hit onto the pilot.

Though the modules and crew are considerably protected, the control surfaces on the plane are not. As such, the most likely way the {{PAGENAME}} can be downed is by a shot-off/busted wing, tail, or their respective control systems.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|VYa-23 (23 mm)|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 23 mm VYa-23 cannons, wing-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)
- 2 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, wing-mounted (750 rpg = 1,500 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|AO-25M-1 (25 kg)|FAB-50sv (50 kg)|FAB-100sv (100 kg)|FAB-250sv (250 kg)}}
{{main|RS-82|RBS-82|RS-132|RBS-132}}

- 4 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs + 4 x RBS-132 rockets (400 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, dorsal turret (150 rpg)

Operated by a single gunner, the Berezin UB can provide decent coverage of the {{PAGENAME}}'s rear. If an enemy loiters around the IL-2's upper six o' clock, the gunner can have a decent chance of reaching out and hitting, or even downing the enemy plane.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Tactically, as with all IL aircraft, the Avenger is best suited to ground-pounding at low altitude. Avoiding conflict with aircraft is a priority, as, though tanky, the plane will not withstand much-concentrated fire, especially to its wings. When engaging ground targets, approach at a slight climb before nosing down to begin a shallow dive towards them. Bombing in this way will nearly always allow you to get away from the blast wave, and the 1.5-second delay is more than enough for you to gain enough distance, even from the 250 kg bombs. If using both bombs and rockets, lightening the aircraft from the bombs will allow you to more effectively manoeuvre to use rockets before returning to base. Use bombs against tanks and pillboxes, rockets against groups of light armoured vehicles (and occasionally enemy aircraft), and use your machine guns and cannons for AAA, artillery, armoured cars, and enemy aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
