== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', also referred to as the "IL-2 production of 1943", was a variant of the IL-2 family. It was produced from November 1942 to December 1943 and units began receiving this variant in the early months of 1943. Main differences between the IL-2M (1943) and earlier IL-2s included an improved AM-38F engine which allowed a return to the relatively high bomb load capacity of around 600 kg. The AM-38F ran at a higher RPM and included a 10-minute "forsazh" (WEP) mode. It also featured a stronger engine block and camshafts. However, it didn't escape the earlier AM-38 and even earlier AM-35A's tendency to overheat and also had reduced compression. Nonetheless, the AM-38F significantly increased the IL-2's capability.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"]]. It features two 23 mm VYa-23 cannons with 150 rpg and two 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns with 750 rpg. The VYa cannons have access to a handful of ammunition belts. The armoured target belt has AP rounds that can penetrate up to an impressive 46 mm of armour. There is also a 12.7 mm machine gun behind the pilot which has limited firing angles especially when firing at targets below the aircraft. The IL-2M (1943) has a good variety of ordnance and players will be satisfied with its capability against ground targets.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Although the IL-2M (1943) features the improved version of the AM-38 engine, its overall performance is still lacklustre. The sustained turn performance is inferior to many aircraft, and it struggles at higher altitudes due to the lack of a usable supercharger gear. Moreover, the IL-2M (1943) has a very low top speed of only 400 km/h (250 mph), so many fighters will be able to catch up and set themselves into an advantageous position for an attack. However, the big wings of the IL-2 help it turn quite well for a few turns, and it can put up a good fight provided it's going fast and has significant altitude to play with.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
[[File:IL-2M (1943) Armor.png|thumb|376x376px|IL-2M (1943)'s armour]]
The IL-2M (1943) does a few things very well and one of those is crew protection. The IL-2M has an immense amount of armour surrounding the pilot, gunner, engine, and vital systems like the oil cooler. Furthermore, the self-sealing fuel tanks are mounted in the center of the aircraft which is also protected by armour. The IL-2's design doesn't necessarily have armour plates. The armour is actually a part of the aircraft's structure which keeps the weight down relative to if it had armour plates added on. This is what allowed the designers to protect so much of the aircraft's systems and crewmen.

* 4 mm steel surrounding engine and frontal fuel tank
* 4 mm steel above pilot
* 5 mm steel underneath rear fuel tanks
* 6 mm steel surrounding pilot
* 6 mm steel underneath belly oil cooling system
* 6 mm steel in front of gunner*
* 6 mm steel disc behind propeller spinner
* 12 mm steel behind gunner*
* 64 mm bulletproof glass in front of pilot
* Self-sealing fuel tanks, with neutral gas pressurization system (1 in front of pilot's feet, 1 under pilot, 1 behind gunner*)

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Players should begin researching the radiator module to reduce the overheating nature of the AM-38F. The 12.7 mm and 7.62 mm ammo belts should not be a focus at this point. This will open tier 2 modifications and players can choose between more armament options like rockets or stick to performance modules. The IL-2 already has access to 4 100 kg bombs stock so going for performance modules first is a good option. Once tier 3 is open, players should immediately begin researching the 23 mm ammunition belts. The stock VYa-23 belt is weak against ground targets (50% FI-T, 50% AP-I). With the ammo belt researched, this will unlock the armoured target belt which is 75% AP-I and 25% FI-T. After, players can go back to research more weapons or performance mods but once tier 4 is open, immediately start researching the new VYa-23 cannon module. The VYa-23s have an abysmal amount of dispersion when stock which greatly reduces the effectiveness of the cannons. Once researched, the rest of the performance modules should be researched, then the new rockets/bombs, and finally the 12.7 mm and 7.62 mm guns.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The IL-2M (1943) is mainly limited to attacking ground targets. The 23 mm VYa-23 cannons can easily attack light and medium tanks as well as light pillboxes. However, light pillboxes take a significant amount of ammunition and the IL-2M only has 300 rounds of 23 mm ammunition. The cannons can easily penetrate the engine decks of many tanks at its battle rating so in ground battles the IL-2M (1943) is very potent. However, the 7.62 mm machine guns are ineffective against many ground targets although they can attack and destroy soft ground targets like anti-air positions or open-top vehicles. The bombs and rockets should be used against relatively stronger targets like light pillboxes or heavy tanks.

Fighter cover is incredibly important and it's vital that IL-2M pilots stay on their toes if friendly fighters are nowhere nearby. If an IL-2M pilot has a bandit chasing, hug the ground to make sure the enemy pilot can't sit in the gunner's dead zone beneath the aircraft. Also, use the turret sparingly as it only has 150 rounds. The IL-2M has airspawn in air realistic battles, but it is very difficult to get into an advantageous position against enemy fighters. IL-2M pilots can attack enemy aircraft by partaking in head-ons. The exceptional amount of armour and good guns make it a dangerous aircraft in this scenario: although pilots should do this as a last-ditch effort. Enemy attackers can be attacked relatively easily since they can not easily exploit the IL-2M.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The IL-2M (1943) was one of many variants designed and produced by Iluyshin. The 1943 production series of aircraft was intended to have the upgraded AM-38F engine armed with the 23 mm VYa-23 cannons. During 1943, 20 mm-armed IL-2s were slowly phased out and soon 23 mm-armed IL-2s were dominant. The IL-2M (1943) was largely unchanged from early variants other than the engine, cannons, and the crucial addition of a rear gunner. VVS (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily; Soviet Air Force) units began receiving the IL-2M (1943) in early 1943.
