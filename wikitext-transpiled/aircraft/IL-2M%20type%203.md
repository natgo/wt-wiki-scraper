== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The IL-2M type 3 is an improved version of the famous "Sturmovik" ground attack aircraft. It featured an "arrow wing" design, possessed leading edges that were swept back 15 degrees on the outer panels, giving it a better manoeuvrability and aerodynamic characteristics.

While the IL-2M type 3 is still very slow in straight line like the other IL-2s, it retains a good handling characteristic similar to the [[IL-2 (1942)]]. This, combined with an addition of combat flaps, makes the plane very flexible and can take on almost every enemy at its BR.

* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, dorsal turret (150 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The IL-2M type 3 is an attacker which excels at low altitude. You'll be flying close to the ground in order to hit your targets with your cannons and machine guns, so watch for obstacles and use the IL-2's phenomenal low-speed performance and tight turning circle to get out of harm's way, though beware of the mediocre roll rate and the weak acceleration. Give yourself time to build up a good amount of speed before going for another attack, otherwise, you'll struggle to climb away. Make note of what targets you can eliminate: light pillboxes can be destroyed by your cannons, and even extended MG fire from your 7.62 mm guns, but other pillboxes will be impossible to destroy with your guns, and bombs will need a direct hit. Likewise, light tanks and armoured cars can be destroyed with your guns, but medium tanks will need to be hit from the top or rear to penetrate the thicker armour, and heavy tanks are invulnerable unless you land a direct bomb or rocket hit.

The most interesting additions of the IL-2M type 3 is the wing redesign. An addition of combat flaps and more aerodynamically efficient wing design means that the plane is now more nimble than the single seat [[IL-2 (1942)]]. This makes the Type 3 capable of executing some tight turns to caught an enemy off guard, or attacking ground targets more efficiently.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* Numerous payload arrangements (24) including bombs and rockets of varying size, flexible ground attack options
* Sturdy airframe as with other versions of IL-2s
* Strong protection surrounds the pilot and engine
* Powerful 23 mm VYa cannons allows it to tackle any kinds of targets
* Redesigned wings with combat flaps significantly improve its turn rate, especially at higher speeds
* Rear gunner is equipped with a powerful 12.7 mm Berezin MG to ward off any chasers

'''Cons:'''
* Awfully slow top speed
* Heavy plane; horrible climb rate and sluggish acceleration
* Poor energy retention
* Tail section blocked most of rear gunner's firing range
* Rear gunner carries very limited ammunition
== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
On 21st July 1941 the lead designer of the IL-2 Sergey Ilyushin sent a request to the People's Minister of Aviation, calling for improvement of the IL-2 by upgrading the engine to a 1,675-HP M-82 and increasing the aircraft's armor. The request was extremely urgent, considering that the rapidly advancing German troops at the time threatened serial production of the engines then used on the IL-2. Several influential Party members also called for upgrading the IL-2's engine. Another crucial change, in conjunction with the engine, called for converting the aircraft into a two-seater, based on combat experience. The second crewman would mainly deal with protecting the rear section of the Sturmovik from aerial attack, making it, in the designer's opinion, "nearly invincible". An aft fuel tank, previously installed behind the pilot in the armored tub, was replaced with a gunner compartment under a stretched canopy, armed with a 12.7mm (.50-cal) UBT machine gun with 280 rounds of ammunition. The gunner position, just like the pilot's, was well armored.

Once the prototype was tested, all test pilots concluded that flight performance of the new variant was worse than that of the earlier IL-2 AM-38 variant; however, no changes in overall behavior were noted, the armor was very effective, and no shortcomings that made flying dangerous were uncovered. Therefore, the new prototype was accepted for serial production.
