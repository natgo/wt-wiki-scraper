== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Air Superiority"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XIV, "Airborne General"]].

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|VYa-23 (23 mm)|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 23 mm VYa-23 cannons, wing-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)
* 2 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, wing-mounted (750 rpg = 1,500 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

This aircraft is really useful in Ground RB due to its impressive bomb load. Use the 6x 100 kg bombs for the purpose of quickly obliterating most medium and light tanks at its BR. The 2 x 500 kg and the 2 x 500 kg Armor Piercing bombs to destroy the heavy tanks and the the tank destroyers at its BR. However, be careful due to the face that unlike other strike aircraft, the lack of air brakes hinder the aircraft a lot, so be cautious of dive bombing tanks.

{{Navigation-Start|Default weapon presets}}
{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}

* Without load
* 6 x 50 kg FAB-50sv bombs (300 kg total)
* 6 x 100 kg FAB-100M-43 bombs (600 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg FAB-250M-43 bombs (500 kg total)
* 2 x 220 kg BRAB-220 (1930) bombs (440 kg total)
* 2 x 500 kg FAB-500M-44 bombs (1,000 kg total)
* 2 x 500 kg BRAB-500 bombs (1,000 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, dorsal turret (150 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great at CAS, can help teammate greatly by bombing enemy-held points.
* Quite easy to spawn to Ground RB, only needs to destroy about one tank to spawn.
* Very effective payload of bombs
* 23 mm cannons can generally penetrate most ground targets.

'''Cons:'''

* Only has one machine gun for defense
* Lack of dive brakes makes it harder to dive on targets. 
* Rather low top speed for its BR

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
===[[wt:en/news/8698-developmentbattle-pass-vehicles-il-8-en|Devblog]]===
At the height of WWII, Ilyushin’s design team was tasked with improving the IL-2 attack aircraft by creating two new versions. The first with improved performance characteristics and a reduced payload, and the second with enhanced armor and increasing the payload to 1000 kg. The engine for both versions was to be the new AM-42, and in addition to this numerous improvements to flight and operational characteristics were implemented. The test program for the first prototype of an attack aircraft with enhanced armor, designated the IL-8 AM-42, ended in March 1944. Despite successful test results, this aircraft did not go into production.
