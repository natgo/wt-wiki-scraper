The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (歼-11型歼击机; NATO Codename: Flanker-B), aka '''Su-27SK''' by Sukhoi or '''苏-27''' in PLAAF manuals, is one of the main composition of the PLAAF's modern interceptor fleet since the early 1990s as the overseas solution to upgrade the outdated PLAAF. By 1989, soon after the improving of Sino-Soviet relationships and the nationwide riots during the economic reform, the only viable solution to upgrade PLAAF was from USSR due to the subsequent embargo imposed by NATO countries; a group of military staffs of PLAAF soon departed for the USSR to import the latest Soviet interceptors on May 1990. Initially, the VVS promoted the [[MiG-29]] to Chinese generals during their visit to Kubinka Airbase, but the generals soon spotted the state-of-the-art interceptor [[Su-27|Su-27S]] at the airbase  made the PLAAF go for the Flanker. After a series of meetings since during June to September of 1990, the deal was set to purchase the 38th batches at around USD $1 Billion for 24 jets (18 Su-27SK and 6 UBK twin-seater) by March 1991 and 39th batches of 22 Su-27S respectively. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the PLAAF saw the possibility to purchase the production license of the Su-27SK in 1993. After threats that no further jets would be ordered from KnAAPO and a long negotiation with the now-Russian Federation, the new deal was set for 200 Su-27SK assembled by SAC within 15 years since 1996. The licensed Su-27SK, now called J-11A would increase domestic production rate through the 5 batches. The design of Flanker alongside with its blueprints and punched tapes were further refined by Chinese engineers with the help of CAD that was first used on J-10 and later JH-7A, revising the redundancies of the original design and eventually set the foundation for the J-11B (Flanker-L) and future Flanker derivatives.

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]] as part of the upgrade, the J-11 shares a close to identical performance to its Soviet counterpart (while 570 kg heavier). Thanks to its well refined aerodynamic design, power engines, loads of A-A weaponries and sufficiently powerful radar/IRST, the J-11 leads the PLAAF into the current apex of air battles. While its sheer size and inferior electronics can be a problem in different occasions, the J-11 will not disappoint players with Flanker's iconic features.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
In short words: the overall flight performance is close to identical to Soviet's Su-27. Thanks to the well-refined airframe which took almost a decade to design, the Su-27 series is famous for its great manoeuvrability even at its huge size. To put it in perspective: the Su-27/J-11 is almost 4 m longer than MiG-29 series at 21 m, while it is at very similar length to PLAAF's own J-8II series, the large, trapezium wing still makes it the overall largest PLAAF interceptor up to present day (including the domestic refined J-11B and later variants). In first glance, players might consider such a huge jet doesn't have as much manoeuvrability as MiG-29 series; when they eventually have the chance to fight the J-11, they will soon know that it will be a hassle to handle, thanks to the FBW systems, airframe designs and two powerful AL-31F engine that gives almost average T/W ratio at 1.0, most earlier jets from lower BR will have major problem handling the J-11. When players expect to see an stall-out Flanker, what they might see is that: their own jet will be the first one to stall out before the Flanker eventually stalls out, sometimes even performing the iconic Pugachev's Cobra - where the jet can achieve up to 110° AoA at such speed while pulling the control stick and level out at the same altitude, therefore players might want to think twice before engaging the J-11.

But just like what the introduction mentioned, the problem is also its sheer size. Considering for its 21x14 m size, it is also easy to land shots or missiles upon the J-11 if players make an error during aerial dogfights; any damaged part of the airframe will significantly increase drag of Flanker and thus higher risk of being shot down. Be sure to utilize its manoeuvrability in solo fights, not gang fights with very little reaction time and room for errors - one wrong move can be its demise. As for the Pugachev's Cobra,  it is more of aerobatics than a tactic to reverse the battle, it is never a good idea to show the largest possible surface area to enemy guns.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
By 1980s, to further reduce the weight, most interceptors were not equipped with extra armor plates for both the pilot and critical components; this is no exception for the Flanker series, thus the pilot can face fatal hits from both autocannons or missile shrapnel.

Meanwhile, all the 5 fuel tanks onboard are self-sealed, meaning that with the help of researchable fire extinguishers, the J-11 can save itself from fatal structural failure in case of a fire.

The J-11's arsenal is entirely Soviet, which presents interesting new opportunities for pilots used to Chinese top-tier aircraft. It is oriented as an air superiority fighter, lacking any guided air-to-ground munitions, but it has some tricks up its sleeve when the airspace is more permissive to CAS.

Two families of air-to-air missiles are available, the R-73 and the R-27. The R-73E is a functionally identical export version of the R-73 short-range, IR-guided missile seen on later Soviet aircraft like the [[MiG-29SMT]] and the [[Su-25T]]. It has a great 40 G overload, a thrust vectoring system that helps it maintain sustained hard turns, and ECCM to help resist flares. Compared to the domestic [[PL-8]], it's generally an all-round improvement aside from the lower top speed. R-73s can be mounted on any of the six wing hardpoints.

The R-27 comes in radar-guided (R-27R1 standard, R-27ER1 extended-range) and IR-guided (R-27T1 standard, R-27ET1 extended-range) flavors and are the J-11's main armament for medium and long range combat. The "1" suffix denotes export variants, but again they happen to perform identically. The R-27ER1 is the J-11's best weapon for BVR combat, as its extreme speed and long range allow it to win jousts against targets with slower missiles. The R-27ET1 is a great option for distant sneak attacks as it does not give any RWR warning to its target. R-27s can be mounted on any of the four fuselage pylons and also the inboard wing pylons, but the catch is that the IR-guided -T1 and -ET1 can only be mounted on the inboard wing pylons, and are thus limited to at most 2.

Three types of unguided rockets are available, all carried as double racks on the inboard wing pylons. The S-8KO HEAT rocket comes in large pods and is significantly better than its domestic Chinese equivalent (Type 90-1) with greater penetration, flight speed, and capacity. However at the J-11's battle rating, such weapons are rather questionable for jet fighters as they have issues harming MBTs from the front and have a limited effective range. The S-13OF can be considered a heavier and more powerful cousin to the Type 130-2 HE rocket with a bonus of one extra rocket per pod; it can destroy light targets through splash damage at fair distances and direct hits can still crack open MBTs with some luck. The S-25O heavy bunker-buster previously featured on the [[Su-25]] is a unique tool lacking any equivalent in the domestic Chinese arsenal; it carries only one shot per pod and packs more explosive content than a 100 kg bomb. It may seem like a crude weapon for an elegant air-superiority fighter, but in typical Soviet ground attack fashion the S-25O can blow anything on the ground to smithereens through brute force.

The J-11 is also an impressive bomb truck, ironically outclassing or matching the [[JH-7A]] fighter-bomber. Iron bombs are available in sizes of 100, 250, and 500 kg. Incendiary and high-drag bombs are available in the 500 kg size.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Although PLAAF deemed Su-27SK, aka J-11 as the main composition of PLAAF in 1990s and early 2000s, they did have plans to introduce the more advanced domestic avionics to replace the OEM equipment. As for J-11, although it has flawed avionics with inferior RWR and unreliable radar, the sheer payload and maneuverability can make it a great alternative to [[F-16A MLU (China)|ROCAF's F-16A]] in air battles while retaining sufficient but less advanced means for ground attack operations.

; Air Battle - The Far East Flanker

The concept of Flanker series are solely for air-interception missions; just looking to the overall payload of J-11, it still leave the trace of Soviet air-defense doctrine of intercepting enemy bombers with SARH missiles. But before players can unleash missile hell against enemy jets, R-27T1 and R-73E will be the only options for the J-11 at early stages; while R-73E is known for their maneuverability even at close distance and sufficient tracking radius against enemy targets, players will need to get used to a major rule of top-tier battles: always aim for those who didn't launch flares to interfere with the missile seeker. In most cases, jets within the 4 km radius of J-11 can be potential prey of R-73E as they are likely be concentrated on taking out friendly jets; thanks to the HMD on J-11 and great overload of R-73E, players can employ some of the most impressive maneuvers to make sure the missile is within the firing range. In most cases, unless enemy jets launched flares in very short interval, they will become easy prey for the missile. As for the R-27 series, both the E and R series with IR/radar seeker are the the best friends of J-11 thanks to their impressive thrust and overload at long distance; as long as the missile can keep on the track with enemy targets, both high and low-altitude targets will become an easy prey for players while earning more experiences for other usages.

But when players have the need to gun down enemy jets in dogfights, while the powerplants and design of J-11 can make sure it can sustain long enough dogfight before it took out enemies or the arrival of friendly jets, as mentioned in previous paragraph, it is better leave the J-11 as an interceptor to take out any high-altitude targets who also planned to take out the friendly targets with SARH or ARH missiles (i.e. F-14B), thus players have to keep a keen eye on any radar signals on the SPO-15LM RWR or from its N001E radar. Make sure to pick the best possible target to dealt with as this can also help friendlies to secure the victory of battle, as well as evading enemy tracking radar as much as possible which gives them as little reaction time as possible - it is always better to take out enemy targets before they even have the chance to fire upon friendly targets, which can in turn affect the morality of enemy team as well.

; Ground Battle - The Long-time Tradition

Among the Chinese community, there were a saying that ''"Anything in PLAAF must come with ground-attack capabilities using unguided rockets"''. This is in fact true for J-11 in this case as there are many images from PLAAF showing Su-27SK or future J-11B series carrying Russian/domestic rocket pods for ground attacks. The Flanker family is known for their interception capabilities but the rather abundant payload is also a good platform for ground-attack operations albeit lacking any precision munitions; pylons on J-11 is totally identical to Su-27S with multiple payload point, when players think a Flanker is nowhere an attacker, it does in fact have even more bombs in quantity to Chinese domestic JH-7A (30 x 250 kg bombs vs. 22 x 250 kg bombs) in case players want to cause extensive damage to enemy armored column. Players can also go for even more bombs with 100 kg bombs or better kill radius with 500 kg bombs, depending on the playstyle and the composition of enemy vehicles, it is always a good idea to carry varieties of bombs for heavy targets while leaving the rocket pods (twin pods) to handle light vehicles; for example, the FAB-500 series is a good idea to take out heavy targets in stationary or armored columns, while leaving B-8 or B-13 rocket pods against light vehicles or SPAAs. But as a thumb of rule of Flanker family in-game: always plan for your assault when entering the battlefield as enemy SPAAs or fighters would want to hunt down enemy jets as well. Thanks to the CCIP and CCRP onboard, the J-11 can employ both high-altitude or low-altitude approach against enemy targets, either by bombing a certain area filled with enemy vehicles or evading SPAAs before unleashing hell against enemy players. If the skies are full of enemy jets which SPAA systems could not handle, it will also be a good time to utilize the great missiles on J-11 ranging from R-73E up to the devastating R-27ER1; it is always a good idea to pick careless players that are too concentrated on ground-attacks.

==== The Dire Situation ====
By late 1980s, both the J-8II series has already finalize the design and JH-7 were in development process; it was still the time of Sino-Vietnamese War which can be said as a war without air forces, PLAAF concerned about the fleet of Su-22 of VPAF while the latter concerned for the extensive air defense network of PLAAF. Although the need for new interceptor can be fulfilled by future J-8II, the Johnson South Reef skirmish rose the question to Chinese military commands: the lack of advanced interceptors to intercept enemy jets with AShM ''(namely, Su-22UM3K/M4)''; although the skirmish saw the total victory of PLAN with only one soldier injured and four VPAN vessels sunk, AShM was still the major concern for the PLAN fleet. This eventually led to a debate for whether introducing the production line of foreign jet fighters were viable - for PLAAF general staffs, this can improve the air force rapidly; while this also meant death sentence for any further domestic designs by domestic aircraft designers. The PLAAF at the time were threaten by USAF and JASDF's [[F-15 (Family)|F-15]] series, the future ROCAF domestic F-CK-1 IDF,  imported Mirage 2000-5Ei and [[F-16A MLU (China)|F-16A Blk. 20]], as well as [[MiG-29 (Family)|Fulcrum]] and namely, [[Su-27|Su-27 Flanker]] from Soviet Union.

==== The Komsomolets from Far East ====
The [[Su-27]] (NATO: Flanker) series were one of the top secrets of the Soviet Union since its introduction in 1985 with the PVO (Su-27P interceptor), although plans to export Su-27 has been in development since 1987, due to the dire need for funding to further develop the Flanker family, Soviet Government revoked the 1988 certification with downgraded electronics and ECM equipment after listening to the suggestions from Sukhoi engineers, instead, the new revision with only the removal of R-27E started on November 1989 and passed for export certifications on 12 February 1990. Just a few months earlier on May 1989, Mikhail Gobachev made his historical visit to Mainland China amid Chinese's nationwide protests for reform; however, the protests soon escalated to riots and resulted with the sanctions from NATO countries for any further military projects. After the halt of [[J-8B|J-8II]] Project 8-2 and the commence of Project 8-3, PLAAF has dire need for new interceptors to fill in the gap; a team of general staff led by Liu Huaqing (刘华清) went to USSR in May 1990 for the purchase of Soviet fighter jets, the two countries held a conference on 31 May where the general staffs eventually knew the existence of Su-27 from the mouth of Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the last Minister of Defense in future, the approval of negotiations and import of Soviet jet fighters was then codednamed the Project 906 (906工程). During the talks, Soviet general staffs originally only opted MiG-29 as the export product and deemed PLAAF not able to reverse-engineer the aircraft in short time, while PLAAF officials saw the inferior range and electronics of MiG-29 as the deal-breaker; however, Shaposhnikov saw the possibilities to sell their most advanced fighter jets to Mainland China despite the pressure from Soviet officials. By the time Chinese general staffs departed for Mainland China, Soviet government has approved the sales in principle. 

Soon after the negotiations and the impressive demonstration for PLA general staffs on August and September of 1990 at the Kubinka Airbase performed by Viktor Pugachev himself ''(the namesake of Pugachev's Cobra)'', USSR general staffs authorized the export of Flankers to Mainland China by October 1990; however Soviet officials originally decided to export the 1st revision with downgraded electronics, this of course cause outrages to PLA officials. Soviet officials arrived in Beijing on December 1990 for the final negotiations and eventually, Soviet Union officially approved for the sale of 18 Su-27SK and 6 of its twin-seater variant, Su-27UBK at US $1 billion as the 38th batch of Su-27 produced by KnAAPO ''(Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant)'' and Irkut at Irkutsk on 28 December. To pay these 24+2 ''<small>(Note: 2 more used Su-27UBKs and engine parts were acquired at discounted rates straight from Sukhoi, purchased solely with goods trading)</small>'' jets from Soviet Union, both country agreed for partial payment at 35% ''(5% from State Council, 30% from arms trades approved by CMC)'' with USD while the remaining would be industrial products from China, namely water kettles, blankets and hide coats; which rose fights for this deal between Chinese factories. The first two Su-27UBKs from Sukhoi arrived on 30th May way before the official delivery of the first 12 jets (eight SK and four UBK) delivered from Dzhida Airbase in Buryatia, to Wuhu Wanli Airbase, Anhui on the morning of 27th June, 1991; the remaining jets were all delivered in 25th November 1992 straight from Komosomolsk-on-Amur, where they were manufactured. <ref>https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wi4y1k7pq/

<small>''Trivia 1: Just before the intended delivery of the first 10 Flankers in 1992, due to the collapse of Soviet Union, Rostec has to pay extra '''USD $200K''' for crossing the airspace of Mongolia.<ref name=":0">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1SY411B75K/

<small>''Trivia 2: Russian pilots flew even faster than PLAAF general staffs who departed from Beijing during the June delivery, thus the jets and pilots would have to wait for the general staffs instead of opposite; all Soviet and Chinese pilots, as well as interpreters involved received USD$ 2000 bonus for their mission.''</small><ref name=":0" />

Soon after the introduction of Flankers in PLAAF service, PLAAF went for the production license of Su-27S and threatened the Russians with no further orders after the 39th batch ''(22 jets; totaled at 48 Su-27 series)''; this later led to a long negotiation since August 1993 and eventually set the deal in December 1996, where 200 Su-27SK would be assembled or produced by SAC within 15 years with 2 batches (105; 95 jets). SAC would receive the CKD kits of Su-27SK from KnAAPO to be assembled locally, while future jets would be SKD kits with progressive replacement with domestic parts; the Project 11 (11号工程) lead by Li Ming ''(李明; chief engineer of J-8II)'' soon received the documents in 1995 for the preparation of domestic assembly, the engineer team translated the documents for a year. With the manufacture equipment and SKD kits delivered to Shenyang in Spring of 1998, SAC assembled a complete jet with the help of Russian engineers and the first domestic assembled Su-27SK, now J-11(A) "Blue 49" with batch number 0001, soared into the skies on 1st September, 1998, marking one of the page of cooperation between Mainland China and Russia 4 decades after the split.

The J-11(A) series would be produced for another 4 batches (01xx to 04xx) before SAC finalized and digitalized the design documents of Flanker for domestic improvements, which would later known as the J-11B (Flanker-L) since 2006; while some J-11A received domestic and Belarusian upgrades for upgraded FCS with ARH missile capabilities and new avionics (most notably the original command datalink screen was replaced by a MFI-55 MFD and a few installed domestic UV MAWS). The Su-27SK and J-11A have been decommissioned by 2020s, likely been replaced by Chinese Flankers; while the Su-27UBK are still in service in small quantities as lead-in trainers for units operating Flankers.
