== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]].

Largely identical to the Soviet [[MiG-19PT]], the J-6A is the first supersonic PLAAF jet available in the Chinese tech tree and has much to offer; radar, air-to-air missiles, and powerful guns in addition to high speed and acceleration. The only physical difference between it and the MiG-19PT is the relocated braking parachute, which is now placed at a bulge on the base of the rudder instead of underneath the engines.

Compared to the [[F-100A (China)|F-100A]], its Taiwanese counterpart across the strait, the J-6A flies much better but has inferior suspended weapons. The J-6A's meagre selection of small bombs and rockets may be disappointing in combined battles. Still, pilots who practice with this plane or are used to its Soviet version can pose a major threat to enemy fighters. Despite having a lower top speed than many of the aircraft it encounters, the J-6A's excellent acceleration and relatively good manoeuvrability let it punch above its weight when flown carefully.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

Compression at high speeds is an issue for this aircraft. It especially affects the rudder. However, the J-6A generally has a very responsive elevator, although excessive turning will bleed much speed due to the poor energy retention. As with many jets, manoeuvrability is poor at low speeds.

The aircraft has very good acceleration and climb rate.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The aircraft is fairly fragile, with any hits likely to damage the engines due to how much space they take up inside the plane. When spaded one engine has enough power to get you back to base, but while stock it is a little harder and you may end up crashing. One benefit of the J-6A though is that the elevators are separate to each other in the damage model, and therefore a hit to the tail causing an elevator loss isn't the end of the world, since the remaining one is good enough to continue the fight. Another point to note is that loss of oil in either engine will rapidly cause engine failure, so it is best to return to base ASAP when damaged.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 30-1 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm Type 30-1 cannons, wing-mounted (70 rpg = 140 total)

The J-6A carries two 30 mm Type 30-1 cannons, mounted in the wing roots. They are licensed copies of the MiG-19's [[NR-30 (30 mm)|NR-30]] cannons and offer identical performance. Each gun has 70 rounds of ammunition, making a total of 140 rounds. The Type 30-1 cannons are very fast firing so this is not much ammo, and you can't afford to spray. The guns however are extremely powerful, and only a couple of rounds hitting an enemy aircraft will severely cripple them, if not outright kill them. The shell velocity is very high and you don't need much lead to hit a target.

The recommended belts for this aircraft are "Armoured targets", they're more reliable than the "Air targets" belt and tend to take off wings and large sections, and destroy engines with one hit, in comparison to the "Air targets" belts which tend to spark or just damage external modules. The ground belts contain APHE rounds with 60 mm of penetration, but it is not really worth going for ground targets as the limited ammunition and high speed of the aircraft makes it very difficult to hit or kill anything.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|OFAB-100 (100 kg)|OFAB-250sv (250 kg)|PL-2|S-5K}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 16 x S-5K rockets
* 32 x S-5K rockets
* 2 x PL-2 missiles
* 2 x 100 kg OFAB-100 bombs (200 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (500 kg total)

The J-6A can be equipped with PL-2 missiles, licensed copies of the Soviet [[R-3S]] with identical performance.

The ideal use-case for the PL-2 is when you're at very high speed, following something like a Phantom from around a mile. The missile will get to the target before they can react, and with large targets like the Phantom, they can't pull hard enough at those speeds to evade the missile. It is not recommended to fire the missile in any sort of turn as they will just lose track.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The J-6A has great vertical energy retention and acceleration, so you should use this to your advantage. Taking the enemies vertical is the best move as they will quickly lose energy while you can maintain it. Once at high speed, the J-6A will out-accelerate almost all other aircraft, so once you're on the tail of an enemy they will not have many options. The airbrake is also a very effective tool, allowing you to stay behind someone if they try to force you to overshoot and the plane also rolls well enough that you can engage in rolling scissors if need be.

It is recommended to avoid throttling down the engine as it has an extremely long spool time until it produces max thrust and this will let your opponent get away from you while you struggle to accelerate.

=== Radars ===
{{main|RP-5}}

The {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with a [[RP-5]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Higher top speed possible than [[F-100D]] at most altitudes, although very comparable to it at sea level
* Incredibly high rate of climb
* Hard-hitting guns, low recoil effects due to wing root placement
* Great vertical energy retention
* Roll rate superior to the [[J-4]]
* Incredible acceleration from 600-900 km/h, so it is able to regain energy very fast
* Has a target detection and tracking radar
* Decent manoeuvrability

'''Cons:'''

* Compression at high speed, wings don't provide as much lift as the Super Sabre
* Wings can rip when rolling and turning at high speed
* Only two air-to-air missiles, locking range is 0.5 km less than that of the AIM-9B on F-100D
* Poor low-speed manoeuvrability
* Ventral fin will impact the ground during takeoff if the rotation is prematurely initiated resulting in the tail breaking off
* Engines are huge; can be easily disabled by enemy fire
* Radar suite is not as good as the one fitted on the [[Javelin F.(A.W.) Mk.9]] and [[Mitsubishi T-2]]

The People's Republic of China received considerable military and technological assistance from the Soviet Union for most of the 1950s. Significant quantities of jet fighters, including the [[MiG-9 (China)|MiG-9]], [[J-2|MiG-15bis]], [[J-4|MiG-17]], and others were purchased to modernize the nation's otherwise haphazard and antiquated air force, which at the end of the Chinese Civil War consisted of assorted captured American and Japanese aircraft. Production licenses were secured for the MiG-17 and MiG-19, and these two aircraft models were produced as the domestic [[Shenyang F-5|Shenyang J-5]] and '''Shenyang J-6'''.

The '''J-6A,''' aka Dongfeng 102 (东风102) or Type 59 Interceptor (59式歼击机), was intended as an equivalent of the MiG-19P and first flew in 1958. Quality control issues, resulting from the limited experience of the Chinese manufacturing industry at the time, meant that the performance of the aircraft was inferior to the original. The aircraft was rejected by the PLAAF and production was limited. In the mid 1970s, production was restarted with new jigs from the Soviet Union. These new aircraft were of an acceptable standard and entered PLAAF service in extensive numbers.

A large number of variants and prototypes were made, though their designations and designs are muddied and difficult to research. The "J-6B" variant was a copy of the Soviet MiG-19PM interceptor model, which lacked cannon armament and was armed solely with beam riding air-to-air missiles, though its performance was unsatisfactory like the early J-6A and only a small number were produced. Several models were designed after the [[MiG-19S (Germany) |MiG-19S]] and a handful entered serial production. Later variants relocated the braking parachute to the base of the rudder. Various prototypes experimented with MiG-21 style shock cones. Reconnaissance and two-seat trainer variants were also manufactured, the latter being notable since the Soviet Union did not manufacture any MiG-19 trainer variants. One trainer airframe, known as BW-1 (变稳-1) was used to test the fly-by-wire system of the JH-7 fighter-bomber.

The J-6 served in the PLAAF for far longer than the MiG-19 had in the VVS. While it became outdated and suffered from numerous issues regarding service life and quality, the Chinese aircraft industry learned a considerable amount from its development and manufacturing. The J-6/MiG-19 design was further developed into the more well-known Nanchang Q-5 attacker.

During its 4-decade-long service life since 1962, J-6 served as the cornerstone of PLAAF and scored quite a few victories over ROCAF and USAF/USN; the J-6 was also exported to several nations under the "F-6" designation and participated in several conflicts. The F-6 was operated by Pakistan in the 1971 war with India (with some victories over the IAF), by Vietnam in the Vietnam War (alongside the original MiG-19), and curiously enough by both Iran and Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War. In these conflicts the F-6 was often relegated to air-to-ground missions since its speed and avionics were inadequate, though it was capable of dispatching subsonic aircraft and could outmanoeuvre faster jets in a dogfight.

At present, the J-6 has been retired by most of its users, with North Korea having the largest number of remaining jets in service.
