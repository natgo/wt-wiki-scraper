== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was one of the 4 earliest examples of the P-51s the Swedish got their hands on. Initially, P-51B-7 nicknamed "Hub", crash-landed in neutral Sweden after engaging in German airspace and like the other 3 P-51s that crash-landed in Sweden, got bought by the Swedish and were evaluated for potential Swedish service.

It was introduced during [[Update "Sky Guardians"]] as a rank III reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XI, "Her Majesty's Hussar"]]. Being a P-51B model, it only comes with 4 x .50 cals and the possibility to load 2 bombs under the wings.

{{main|Akan m/45 (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 12.7 mm Akan m/45 machine guns, wing-mounted (280 rpg outer + 350 rpg inner = 1,260 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

{{main|AN-M30A1 (100 lb)|AN-M57 (250 lb)|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs (200 lb total)
* 2 x 250 lb AN-M57 bombs (500 lb total)
* 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (1,000 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} is an early model P-51 which is similar to the [[P-51C-10]] in performance, sharing similar firepower capabilities and characteristics. P-51 early models lacks compared to the later war models 2 x [[M2 Browning (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm M2 Browning]] to the P-51D and H model giving them a bit less firepower than the late war models which can make it a bit tougher to deal with the larger aircraft and the more heavily-armoured ones.

'''Air Battles:'''
P-51 are known to be great at "Boom n Zoom" tactics, which indulge in maintaining its speed over the opponent where it dives to gain speed on the opponent then using the gain speed to get into an position of advantage over the target again to either do a second pass or find a new alternative target that may pose a threat to the P-51. Having 4 x hard-hitting M2 Browning machine guns and 1260 rounds means it does not lack in any firepower or ammunition to deal with most aircraft it will face. Though more heavily-armoured airplanes like [[IL-2]] can be a bit harder to neutralize with only the 4 machine guns if not dealing good crippling shots to the [[IL-2]], Some larger bombers can also be a though nut to crack if not taking care and properly aim at weak spots due to hitting the main fuselage could end up with the P-51 depleting its ammo fast and not doing much damage. The P-51 shine when it have the altitude advantage and can play to its strengths of diving on the target. It will have a hard time dealing with opponents in a dogfight, where it can bleed its speed and be easily outmanoeuvred by planes like [[Yak-3]] or [[Spitfire Mk Vb/trop]] that will have the manoeuvrability at low speed over the P-51.

'''Ground Battles:'''
The {{PAGENAME}} is best to maintain air superiority over the enemy team, protecting its own team from being attacked from the air. The {{PAGENAME}} got its 4 x [[M2 Browning (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm M2 Browning]] that can with ease deal with most enemy air units that could be sent in, The M2 Brownings can also be used to give allied ground units assistance by hitting lightly-armoured targets from above or any open top vehicle to either disable or neutralize the enemy target. In a supporting role, the {{PAGENAME}} can also used 2 x ordnance bombs to bring with into battle in case of any more heavily-armoured vehicles will appear. The P-51 gets a synchronized bomb drop, making it able to only do one bomb run before having to return to airfield to restock on bombs. Since it is lacking in ground supporting capabilities, it is best suited to maintain air superiority over the battlefield, protecting allied ground attackers, bombers, and suppressing enemy fighters or SPAAs.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* Great Boom & Zoom aircraft
* Great acceleration
* Large fuel capacity
* Good high altitude performance

'''Cons:'''
* Limited to two bombs
* Fewer [[M2 Browning (12.7 mm)|M2 Browning]]s than late war models

* High stall speed
