The '''J2M2 Model 11''', designated as '''Raiden Mod.11 ({{Annotation|雷電一一型|Lightning Bolt, Model 11}})''', was the first production model of the [[J2M (Family)|J2M 'Raiden' family]]. It was developed as a land-based defense interceptor to protect Japanese Navy bases from (high-altitude) bombers. The Navy requested this project in 1939, but only Mitsubishi responded and assigned Jiro Horikoshi and his team to work on it after the A6M production was secured. The first prototypes of the J2M were built in 1942, but it faced several technical issues, such as excessive engine vibrations and unreliable landing gear, which delayed its development and production. The Navy had high expectations for the J2M, considering it a potential replacement for the A6M, but due to its troubled development and production, the Raiden was only used as a stop-gap interceptor with limited success until the more promising [[N1K (Family)|N1K-J 'Shiden']] was available.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"]]. Equipped with 2 machine guns and 2 cannons, the Raiden will primarily rely on its heavy-hitting cannon armament as it should be primarily used in Boom-N-Zoom tactics due to its excellent climb rate and diving speeds. It has average manoeuvrability at low-medium speeds but will be severely limited once it reaches its high diving speeds.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The J2M2 Raiden is an interceptor that excels in the Boom & Zoom play style. Once off the ground, the aircraft becomes an absolute monster, with a ludicrous climb rate, exceeding 20 meters per second, or close to 4,000 feet per minute of climb. This climb rate can be used to gain altitude and height over the enemy, and when they engage your slower, but much more manoeuvrable comrades flying Zeros, you swoop in and attack, which can be finished with quick bursts of the wing-mounted 20 mm cannons. Although half of your belt is next to useless when stock, a solid burst with upgraded belts has a good chance to critically damage, if not outright down, an enemy aircraft. The ammo load of 200 rounds is not large but provides enough to keep you fighting if one does not spray too much.

If one is unable to down an enemy quickly enough, the good energy retention in the vertical allows the craft to zoom back up to altitude for another attack. The aircraft does have some deficiencies, however. Its turning circle is closer to that of a P-51 or Fw-190, and in a sustained turn fight, it will lose energy and become a sitting duck. Compression becomes an issue at high speeds, and although faster than the majority of Japanese fighter aircraft, it still struggles to catch faster opponents, such as P-51s or P-47s. This can be countered by climbing at a high angle when in pursuit and then using that accumulated energy to close the gap and open fire.

The aircraft shares the same characteristics as the future J2M3 and M5 and can be a demo of what is there to come in the Japanese tree.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

Unlike other Japanese fighters, the J2M2 has some decent armour. There is a 70 mm bulletproof glass plate in front of the pilot. There is also a tiny triangular section of steel that is 8 mm behind the pilots head. Another thing the J2M2 has that other Japanese planes don't have near rank 3, is self-sealing fuel tanks. There is however no armour around the engine so the engine is very prone to bullets striking and damaging it.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 99 Model 2 (20 mm)|Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons, wing-mounted (100 rpg = 200 total)
* 2 x 7.7 mm Type 97 navy machine guns, nose-mounted (550 rpg = 1,100 total)

The two 7.7 mm machine guns are mounted in the cowling of the aircraft serve as good backups if the cannons run dry, or if there is a need to poke a fleeing enemy into a manoeuvre, lest they are felled by a thousand strings of rifle fire.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Navy Type 97 Number 6 (60 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (120 kg total)

The two 60 kg bombs are enough to destroy light pillboxes in a pinch, or if your bombing skills are exceptional, you can use these bombs for precise targeting against tanks in ground RB, although the J2M2's lacklustre turn rate will be exacerbated by the low manoeuvring required in the game mode.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

In the start of a match, you'll want to use your best advantage, climbing. The J2M2 has an incredible rate of climb for its BR. This will almost always guarantee you an altitude advantage, and from there, you should pick out your targets one-by-one. The J2M2 does not have the best offensive guns so make sure to never head-on. If you are diving on an opponent and they are trying to head-on, break off and do a spiral climb. Your opponent (if he's greedy enough) will stay on you and lose all of his energy. Once you see him about to go into a stall, quickly dive down to him and shoot him down.  Another advantage of the J2M2 is the top speed. The J2M2 can go very fast for its BR and you should use it to your advantage. One way you can use this is by doing Boom n' Zooms, but make sure to watch your speed. You don't want to go too fast to where you'll start to "lock-up" and have almost no authority of the controls.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent climb rate
* Easily outperforms other allied aircraft it usually faces
* Outturns most allied planes except for the Spitfire
* Small size
* Excellent dive characteristic, able to BnZ
* Great energy / speed retentions in turns
* More ammo for the 20 mm than the early Zero models
* 20 mm does a lot of HE damage
* Has armour and self-sealing fuel tanks

'''Cons:'''

* Requires proper knowledge of the game to use its advantage
* Mediocre Top speed compared to its adversaries it will face
* Airframe compresses at speeds above 700 km/h
* 7.7 mm machine guns are quite ineffective at their battle rating, lowering your combat capability once cannon ammo runs out

{{main|J2M (Family)|l1=History of the J2M}}

===Development===
During the China Incident (Sino-Japanese war) the Navy had sustained some damage from Chinese bomber groups as they didn't have any dedicated interceptors at the time, for this reason the Navy put out multiple specifications for planes to deal with threats which the Chinese made clear to the Navy. For bombers specifically they specified for a strictly local-defense interceptor known as the {{Annotation|14-Shi|14th year of the Showa reign, 1939}} Interceptor.

The designer behind the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]], Jiro Horikoshi and his team started development on this specification. But due the harsh unrealistic specifications for mainly engine output required for the team to use a strong engine which wasn't available yet and with the oversized engine required for the task resulted in a sleek but stubby plane.

After the initial J2M1 prototypes outfitted with the {{Annotation|1,044 kW|1,400 hp}} Mitsubishi MK4C Kasei 13 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engine and didn't come near the specification requirements, engine vibrations coming from the cooling system and a troublesome undercarriage design held it back from being used as a production model.

The [[J2M2|J2M2 Model 11]] was outfitted with {{Annotation|1,379 kW|1,850 hp}} Mitsubishi MK4R-A Kasei 23a 14-cylinder radial engine which somewhat overcame the teething problems but still didn't reach the requirements, overburdened with engine problems and electrical malfunctions in the landing gear remained.

Mitsubishi wanted to make the best of it and get out the J2Ms into combat service before it was officially adopted in the Navy. Engine problems and performance were only further resolved in further modifications.
===Combat History===
The first few produced [[J2M2]]s were delivered to the development units in December 1942 but the troublesome amount of engine problems still held it back from mass production. Troubleshooting almost took a year and the first batch of the serial built [[J2M2|J2M2 Model 11]] could be delivered to 381st Kōkūtai in December of 1943.

Furthermore, the [[J2M2]] saw limited action in the Philippines, although it was largely ineffective due to the limited initial production batch and design flaws.
