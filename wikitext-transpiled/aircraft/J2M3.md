== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.45 "Steel Generals"]].

Although a stubby and small aircraft, the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden can be considered one of the best Japanese fighters. Wielding four 20 mm cannons, this aircraft can spell death for any enemy it encounters. However, the main advantage the Raiden has over its Allied counterparts is its climb rate. In realistic battles, the J2M3 can climb to altitude very fast, especially when given an air start. Once at a high altitude, the Raiden pilot can pick and choose targets, dictating where and when they want to fight. The J2M3's 20 mm cannons may seem lacklustre at first, but they have a knack for snapshots or quick bursts of fire that result in a kill when manoeuvring. Generally, the J2M3 performs similarly to the early Fw 190 A variants, having a deadly armament, good roll rate, low top speed, but higher climb rate. Use what the Raiden does best to achieve success - energy fighting. This aircraft is not built for turn-fighting and when does, will lose all built up energy or speed in turns. Attack enemies from a higher altitude and then regain that altitude once the attack has been delivered. The J2M3 excels at Boom & Zoom attacks due to its high rate of climb and deadly armament.

The Raiden aircraft's main downside is its lack of manoeuvrability at higher speeds. Similar to its German counterpart, the Fw 190 A-8, the Raiden struggles to beat enemies in turn fights, especially Spitfires although one shouldn't turn with a Spitfire in general. If caught in a sticky situation, the Raiden pilot may choose to dive away or seek help from teammates. Trying to fight an enemy Spitfire in a turn battle with the J2M is a terrible idea unless the enemy aircraft is damaged or many teammates are nearby. Moreover, the J2M's high-speed manoeuvrability is poor, making the entire aircraft lock up. It can be very difficult to pull out of a dive, roll, or turn when at high speeds with the J2M. The Raiden's manoeuvrability is more or less on par with its enemies in simulator battles, for the most part.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 70 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen
* 8.5 mm Steel plate in pilot's headrest

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Unlocking all performance modules should be a Raiden pilot's first concern, as the default belts for all weapons are workable. After that, go for the weapon belts, as these make more targets possible (ground units).

{{main|Type 99 Model 1 (20 mm)|Type 99 Model 2 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons, wing-mounted (210 rpg = 420 total)
* 2 x 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannons, wing-mounted (190 rpg = 380 total)

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (120 kg total)
* 2 x Type 3 No.1 Mod.28 Mk.1 rockets
* 2 x Type 5 No.1 Mod.9 rockets
* 2 x Type 3 No.6 Mod.27 Mk.1 rockets
* 2 x Type 5 No.6 Mod.9 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Featuring two 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannons and two 20 mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons with plenty of ammunition, the J2M3 is capable of destroying all kinds of aircraft. Although destroying heavy bombers like the B-29 Superfortress takes a lot of ammunition, the J2M3 can afford to lose some. The "Stealth" belt has the best combination of AP/API and HEF to shred enemy aircraft and are recommended for those who do not need a tracer shell to aim. Alternatively, for those not used to IJN 20 mm cannons, the "Universal" belt is your best bet. The "Tracers" belt is filled with HEF-T shells, but they only contain half of the power of a standard HEF, and can give away your position.

For ground attack, the J2M3 can equip two 60 kg bombs under the wings. While not the biggest, these bombs can help a team win a match, especially in arcade battles. The J2M3 can also wield armour piercing ground targets ammunition for its 20 mm cannons, although 21 mm of penetration is nothing to boast about and should be ignored unless targeting armoured personnel carriers (APC) or similar armoured cars.

Overall, the Raiden is best used as a surprise attack, high altitude, high damage output fighter. While it does not excel in the speed or manoeuvrability categories, it makes up for that in armament and rate of climb.

The Raiden pilot may also find themselves outclassed by high altitude aircraft such as the [[P-51D-5|P-51D-5 Mustang]]. All these aircraft have to do to avoid the J2M is dive away and build up speed, but the J2M3 can generally outturn them with effective use of combat flaps and rudder. Fortunately, the J2M3 has a surprise - a massive ammunition pool totalling 800 rounds. That's 800 rounds of high explosive cannon ammunition that can be dispensed at will towards fleeing enemies. With good aim and practice, it is possible to "snipe" enemies from a kilometre away.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent top speed, although lower than its contemporaries
* Large ammunition pool
* Insanely high climb rate
* Has generally adequate dive characteristics
* Quite excellent energy retention
* Great medium-speed manoeuvrability
* Reasonable roll rate at lower speeds
* Solid armament layout
* Excellent performance at high altitudes

'''Cons:'''

* Very poor high-speed performance
* Prone to engine and fuel fires
* Doesn't turn well at higher speeds
* Elevator doesn't respond well, especially at high speeds
* Lack of armour around fuel tanks or engine
* Differing muzzle velocities between the two models of the Type 99 cannon on the J2M3 will require you to lead much further than normal as an order to utilize the full effectiveness of the J2M3's firepower

===Development===
During the China Incident (Sino-Japanese war) the Navy had sustained some damage from Chinese bomber groups as they didn't have any dedicated interceptors at the time, for this reason the Navy put out multiple specifications for planes to deal with threats which the Chinese made clear to the Navy. For bombers specifically they specified for a strictly local-defense interceptor known as the {{Annotation|14-Shi|14th year of the Showa reign, 1939}} Interceptor.

The designer behind the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]], Jiro Horikoshi and his team started development on this specification. But due the harsh unrealistic specifications for mainly engine output required for the team to use a strong engine which wasn't available yet and with the oversized engine required for the task resulted in a sleek but stubby plane.

After the initial J2M1 prototypes outfitted with the {{Annotation|1,044 kW|1,400 hp}} Mitsubishi MK4C Kasei 13 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engine and didn't come near the specification requirements, engine vibrations coming from the cooling system and a troublesome undercarriage design held it back from being used as a production model.

The [[J2M2|J2M2 Model 11]] was outfitted with {{Annotation|1,379 kW|1,850 hp}} Mitsubishi MK4R-A Kasei 23a 14-cylinder radial engine which somewhat overcame the teething problems but still didn't reach the requirements, overburdened with engine problems and electrical malfunctions in the landing gear remained.

Mitsubishi wanted to make the best of it and get out the J2Ms into combat service before it was officially adopted in the Navy. Engine problems and performance were only further resolved in further modifications.

The [[J2M3|J2M3 Model 21]] was developed parallel with the [[J2M2|J2M2 Model 11]] with improved armament of four 20 mm Type 99's in the wings (two [[Type 99 Model 1 (20 mm)|Model 1]]s and two [[Type 99 Model 2 (20 mm)|Model 2]]s).

===Combat History===
Production of the [[J2M3|J2M3 Model 21]] was parallel with the [[J2M2|J2M2 Model 11]] and the first [[J2M3]]s appeared in October 1943 but deliveries to combat units started at the beginning of February 1944.

Furthermore, the [[J2M2]] and [[J2M3]] saw limited action in the Philippines, although it was largely ineffective due to the limited initial production batch and design flaws.
