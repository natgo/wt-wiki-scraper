== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.47 "Big Guns"]] as a premium vehicle purchasable in-game with Golden Eagles {{ge}}, but was removed from in-game sale after the [[wt:en/news/7408-news-happy-birthday-war-thunder-en|9th Anniversary Sale]]. It has been temporarily made available for purchase in-game with Golden Eagles ({{GE}}) during the [[wt:en/news7549-special-national-foundation-day-in-japan-en|2022 "Day of Japan"]] mini-event.
	
Although stubby, the Mitsubishi J2M4, Raiden Model 32 can be considered one of the fastest Japanese fighters in War Thunder, though it is still slower than most of its opponents.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 70 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen
* 8.5 mm Steel plate in pilot's headrest

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 99 Model 1 (20 mm)|Type 99 Model 2 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannons, wing-mounted (190 rpg = 380 total)
* 2 x 20 mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons, wing-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)

Wielding four 20 mm cannons, this aircraft can cripple any enemy it encounters. However, the main advantage the Raiden has over its Allied counterparts is its climb rate. In realistic battles, the J2M4 can climb to altitude very fast, especially when given an air start. Once at a high altitude, this allows the Raiden pilot to pick and choose targets, dictating where and when he or she wants to fight. The J2M4's 20 mm cannons may seem lacklustre at first, but they have a knack for snapshots, or quick bursts of fire when manoeuvring.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Navy Type 97 Number 6 (60 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (120 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Generally, the J2M4 performs similarly to the early Fw 190 A variants, having a deadly armament, good roll rate, low top speed, but higher climb rate. Use what the Raiden does best to achieve success - energy fighting. Instead of turn fighting or bleeding all built up energy or speed in turns, attack enemies from a higher altitude and then regain that altitude once the attack has been delivered. The J2M4 excels at Boom & Zoom due to its high rate of climb and deadly armament, even more so than its earlier variants, the J2M2 and J2M3.

The Raiden's main downside is its lack of manoeuvrability. Similar to its German counterpart, the [[Fw 190 A-8]], the Raiden struggles to beat enemies in turn fights, especially Spitfires. If caught in a sticky situation, the Raiden pilot may choose to dive away or seek help from teammates. Trying to fight an enemy Spitfire in a turn battle with the J2M is a terrible idea, unless the enemy aircraft is damaged or many teammates are nearby. Moreover, the J2M's high speed manoeuvrability is poor, making the entire aircraft lock up. It can be very difficult to pull out of a dive, roll, or turn when at high speeds with the J2M. The Raiden's manoeuvrability is more or less on par with its enemies in simulator battles, for the most part.

The Raiden pilot may also find themselves outrun by high altitude aircraft such as the [[P-51D-5|P-51 D-5 Mustang]]. All these aircraft have to do to avoid the J2M is dive away and build up speed. Fortunately, the J2M4 has a surprise - a massive ammunition pool totaling 800 rounds. That's 800 rounds of high explosive cannon ammunition that can be dispensed at will towards fleeing enemies. With good aim and practice, it is possible to "snipe" enemies from a kilometre away.

Featuring four 20 mm cannons, 2 Type 99 Mk 1 and 2 Type 99 Mk 2 cannons with plenty of ammunition, the J2M4 is capable of destroying all kinds of aircraft. Although destroying heavy bombers like the B-29 Superfortress takes a lot of ammunition, the J2M4 can afford to lose some. The "Stealth" belt has the best combination of AP/API and HEF to shred enemy aircraft, and are recommended for those who do not need a tracer shell to aim. Alternatively, for those not used to IJN 20 mm cannons, the "Universal" belt is your best bet. The "Tracer" belt is filled with HEFT shells, but they only contain half of the power of a standard HEF, and can give away your position.

Overall, the Raiden is best used as a surprise attack, high altitude, high damage output fighter. While it does not excel in the speed or manoeuvrability categories, it makes up for that in armament and rate of climb.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good top speed
* Large ammunition pool
* Climbs very well
* Has generally good dive characteristics
* Good energy retention
* 12 mm armour plate behind windscreen
* Good roll rate at lower speeds
* Decent high altitude performance due to the turbocharger

'''Cons:'''

* Very poor high speed performance
* Prone to engine and fuel fires
* Doesn't turn well
* Elevator doesn't respond well, especially at high speeds
* Lack of armour around fuel tanks or engine
* Differing muzzle velocities between the two marks of the Type 99 cannon on the J2M4 will require you to lead much further than normal as an order to utilize the full effectiveness of the J2M4's firepower

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

===Development===
As the development behind the 14-Shi Interceptor ([[J2M2]] and [[J2M3]]) were disappointing in performance and didn't achieve it's projected goal, Mitsubishi set up a new goal with the availability of newer and stronger engines, this would be called under the 14-Shi Kai Interceptor.

Jiro Horikoshi and his team redesigned the nose of the plane to hold the new Kasei 23c engine and with this prototype they achieved the requested goal, this plane would be known as the J2M4, Raiden Model 32. It solved the engine vibrations and the cooling system was more reliable compared to that of the previous models. It would still preserve the same electrical malfunctions to the landing gear which didn't get redesigned as the engine and its performance were a more pressing issue.

This progress allowed Mitsubishi to further develop the Raiden and so they would with the Kasei 26a, equipping it in the [[J2M5|J2M5, Raiden Model 33]].
