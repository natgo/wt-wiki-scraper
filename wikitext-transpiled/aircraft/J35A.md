== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''J35A''' was the first version of the J35, with a total of 90 units built between the two versions. The J35A1 (kort) had a short afterburner and a short tail. Meanwhile, the J35A2 (long) had a new afterburner with increased thrust, which meant that the tail section needed to be extended. While unexpectedly, this reduced drag, it forced the installation of a retractable tail wheel. The first batch produced in 1960 lacked gunsights and radar, which was a big mistake by the manufacturer, however, in 1961 the remaining units were delivered with the radar and gunsight installed. The J35 was the attempt by Sweden to create a domestic fighter that could replace both the J29 Tunnan and the J32B Lansen. Thus the J35 has many records, including being the first fully supersonic aircraft deployed in Western Europe.

Introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]], it was removed at the end of the 2023 May Sale and is briefly made available on some occasions The '''J35A''' is a capable aircraft for its BR, but it has a few caveats that hamper its performance. For example, the J35A does not have access to any sort of countermeasures, playing safely and with good situational awareness is crucial, since many aircraft like the A-10, Su-25, F-8s and Mig-21SMT/MF to mention just a few, have access to excellent missiles that are very hard to dodge without flares. Thus the J35A needs to remain fast, so it can outrun most missiles and force enemies to do bad launches. It has access to 4 x Rb-24 missiles, which are AIM-9Bs, they are agile and have a decent range, thus they can be used from high altitudes to be dropped on unsuspected enemies.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm Akan m/55 cannons, wing-mounted (100 rpg = 200 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 12 x m/56D rockets
* 4 x RB24 missiles
* 2 x RB24 missiles + 12 x m/56D rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Downtier: In a downtier, the {{PAGENAME}} is one of the best planes in the match. With superior speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability, the {{PAGENAME}} is almost unstoppable. Start off by climbing to around 20,000 ft (~6,000 m) and then levelling off to enter supersonic speeds, here you will have every advantage over your enemies, fire a missile or get close with your high top speed and take them down with your guns.

Uptier: In an uptier, there will be more vehicles that can match your performance with speeds (T-2, MiG-19, F-104, F-105, Lightning) so it will be much harder to get close and fire an unexpected missile. These higher performing planes also make it much harder to get away with a 1-vs-1 turn fight, as seeing a slow Draken will attract almost anyone's attention and you'll find yourself with a missile coming your way. It is recommended to avoid aproaching enemy vehicles head-on and instead to attack slow targets like attackers from behind when they dont expect it. Alternatively, its m/56D rockets can be used as flares against missiles from the front and side. Always try to keep up higher speeds, using the {{PAGENAME}}'s good acceleration to regain the lost speed after a turn.

1-vs-1 situation: In a 1-vs-1 turn fight, the {{PAGENAME}} is one of the best in the game. Its superior turning ability makes it very easy to out-turn the enemy and send a couple 30 mm round their way. Enemies to beware of in a 1-vs-1 are F-5C (very good at turning also and keeps the energy a little bit better than the J35A, in a prolonged dogfight the F-5C can come on top if you get too slow) and MiG-19s/PT (The best rate fighter in the game, if you can drag him into a 1 or 2 circle fight he will be very easy to target, but if the energy/rate fight begins, you may find yourself in a sticky situation)

One weak area of the J35A are its two 30 mm Akan m/55 cannons. While they do very high damage upon hitting, shell velocity is low, ammo capacity is low (only 100 rounds per gun), and it completely lacks tracer bullets. The lack of tracers combined with the low velocity makes accurate aiming for the average player difficult. Due to these factors, it is recommended that you exercise strong trigger discipline to conserve ammo and only fire on slow enemies at closer ranges (<750 m). 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Superior manoeuvrability at all speeds
* Good energy retention at higher speeds (above 850 km/h)
* High top speed
* Good climb performance
* Good acceleration
* Low stall speed
* Hard-hitting 30 mm cannons

'''Cons:'''

* Bleeds energy quickly at lower speeds (below 750 km/h)
* Relatively low maximum fuel load and a fuel thirsty afterburner
* Wings may rip with roll and elevator input at transonic speeds
* Cannons are placed fairly far from the center (convergence issue) 
* Cannons have low velocity and ammo
* All cannon belts lack tracers 
* Only has unguided rockets for CAS
* Lacks countermeasures: no flares or RWR
* RB24 missiles are weak and easily avoided by enemies
* Unstable wing design; if not careful can easily enter an unrecoverable stall or flat spin when manoeuvring at low speeds

The J-35 was a revolutionary design for its time and was developed and manufactured between 1955 and 1974. However, the development started in 1948 as a replacement for the J29 and J32B night fighter. Unlike any other design of its era, it featured a double delta wing, it was also the first fully supersonic aircraft to be deployed in Western Europe, being one of the first to reach Mach 2 in level flight, its unconventional wing design made it capable of performing insane manoeuvres and acrobatics, like the infamous Cobra Maneuver.

Intended as an interceptor, it took the role of the J29 Tunnan as the backbone of the Swedish Air Force and the role of the J32B Lansen as a night fighter, combining the capabilities of both fighters, thus creating a dangerous dogfighter, with supersonic performance and all-weather capabilities. Upgraded in several programs, with the last model being the J35J, the Draken was eventually replaced by the JA 37 Viggen. The Draken was very expensive to operate however, and it was retired in December 1999, before expected, but it was also exported to Austria, Denmark and Finland, being the first its last user.[[File:J35A1.jpg|thumb|373x373px|J35A1 (kort) 1960]]The '''J35A (Adam)''' was the first production version of the Draken. With 90 aircraft delivered between 1960 and 1961. The initial batch was equipped without radar and gunsight, which was corrected in 1961, with the next units being delivered with gunsight and radar. 25 of these last J35As were converted to the Saab 35C, a two-seat trainer to introduce new pilots to the aircraft. Two types of afterburners and airframes resulted in two versions. The '''J35A (kort)''' had a short afterburner and a short tail (65 units built). The '''J35A Long''' on the other hand housed a new afterburner with additional thrust as well as a longer tail section, which reduced drag but forced the installation of a retractable tail wheel (25 units built), this last design would be the one used for future J35 fighters.
