== Description ==<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Saab J-35XS turns very fast, however turning too fast at lower speeds can also lead to a "superstall", which may cause a crash. Tight turns also lead to a significant loss of energy/speed.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

== History ==
Saab 35 is the main name for the "Draken"- series of airplanes produced/designed by the Swedish company SAAB. The J35 series had many different variants like the "J35D" or "J35A", both implemented into War Thunder. After some time SAAB wanted to produce export variants of the "Draken" and those variants were named "J35X" with X standing for "export version". There were 4 different main versions of the J35X exported. The Finnish J35XS is the only one currently in War Thunder and the full name for this Finnish export version is J35XS. ("XS" stands for "Export-Suomi") <ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_35_Draken#Export_variants]Wikipedia Article</ref>

All the official export versions of the "Draken" were just variants of the regularly used J35D and J35F models with the J35XS being a variant of the J35F one. Therefore it featured almost every feature that the F-variant had. Both the J35F and J35J had IRST which was a very useful function for the airplane as it didn't produce any radar waves that could be detectable by the enemy. With the J35XS being a variant of the J35F it of course featured an IRST-system.<ref>[https://modelingmadness.com/review/mod/sweden/plesfinj35.htm]</ref>  

The most advanced "Draken" (The J35J) was reserved for Swedish use only and wasn't available for export countries. 

In the early development of the premium aircraft J35XS, it was considered to have the fully Swedish J35J instead as the new premium rank VII aircraft. Both of them are very similar but the J35J is slightly more advanced. <ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/znphk8/apparently_theyre_changing_the_j35j_to_j35xs/]</ref>     <!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
