== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

=== Flight performance ===

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The J5N1 is not very durable. Although there is 70 mm thick bulletproof glass and 20 mm of steel armour protecting the pilot from the front, the aircraft is still quite fragile. Despite having self-sealing fuel tanks, fires are almost always lethal, typical of WW2 Japanese aircraft.

{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 5 (30 mm)|Type 99 Model 2 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm Type 5 cannons, chin-mounted (60 rpg = 120 total)
* 2 x 20 mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons, chin-mounted (350 rpg = 700 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Similar to the previous aircraft in its tech tree branch, the J5N1 excels at hunting down enemy bombers. The heavy armament of the J5N1 allows it tear apart even the most heavily armed aircraft it will face, and it can gain remarkable amounts of speed in a straight line over time. Compared to the Ki-108 preceding it, the J5N1 also has substantially better vertical energy retention, allowing boom and zoom to be a somewhat more viable tactic. Pilots should be wary of approaching enemy bombers from behind, as although the pilot will probably be safe due to the aircraft's frontal protection, the rest of the aircraft is quite vulnerable.

This aircraft performs best when no enemy fighters lurk above it - although the J5N1 is surprisingly agile and quick for a twin-engine aircraft, competent enemy fighters with an altitude advantage will likely defeat it in a one-on-one engagement. Thus, similar to previous Japanese twin-engine interceptors, the aircraft excels when teammates are there to support you.

The J5N1's worst enemies are Bf 109s and Spitfires. The variants you will face at the J5N1's BR can both outclimb and outturn the J5N1 if piloted properly, and are tough to defeat in one-on-one engagements unless the J5N1 pilot comes in with an altitude advantage, element of surprise, or both. If you cannot find yourself above enemy Bf 109s or Spitfires, try avoiding them and see if your teammates can help you. Against Yaks and Lavochkins, try to engage them above 4,000 m/13,000 ft, as Soviet aircraft barring the likes of the I-225 tend to perform worse at altitude.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Devastating armament - its 30 mm cannons are both high velocity and very deadly
* All guns are mounted in the nose
* Surprisingly fast for a twin-engine aircraft - can exceed 700 km/h even in very shallow dives
* Improved vertical energy retention over previous heavy fighters means BnZ is more viable

'''Cons:'''

* Even with self-sealing fuel tanks, fires are almost always lethal
* Weak rudder
* Mediocre roll rate

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
