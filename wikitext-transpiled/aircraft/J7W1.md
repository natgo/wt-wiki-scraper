== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].

The J7W1 Shinden is a bomber interceptor designed to make quick work of raiding bomber aircraft. It has exceptional performance at altitude, more than exceptional armament and a decent climb rate. Double the weight of a fully loaded A6M, and definitely heaps faster to make up for it. This aircraft thrives with boom and zoom, and has a great energy retention at speed due to sleek aerodynamics. Inherently less stable than a normal tail plane thanks to a rear mounted engine push thrust configuration canard design, it is known for rapid pitch angle changes, great roll rate and less drag, by design. The flap system does not work in game currently however it enhances negative G two fold, at the cost of your speed. You also miss slats on canard wing, which furthermore hampers your agility. The aircraft is very prone to fires, a single hit to the fuel tanks will result in an inextinguishable flame that will for sure be your demise.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The J7W1 Shinden has a maximum speed of 892 km/h (558 mph/485 kt) IAS (this is Vne speed - the absolute maximum speed). In a dive from service ceiling, a speed of mach 0.9 has been recorded and is sustained until IAS speed limit is reached. The aircraft can handle a max load of 11G and compresses rudder, pitch and roll at extremely high IAS speed in order of descending effect.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 70 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen
* 16 mm Steel plate in the nose, in front of ammo boxes and pilot

The J7W1 is protected by armour glass (70 mm) in front of pilot and steel armour plate (16 mm) in front of pilot in between guns. It is very prone to fires, and which are difficult to extinguish. Engine snipes are common, due to the position of the engine. Wing tip damage can increase the likelyhood of unrecoverable flat spins.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Shinden is a quick, pusher prop aircraft that excels in keeping its energy up after diving from a high altitude. It is able to climb up to a nice altitude above its opponents and strafe enemies either with a boom-and-zoom or hit-and-run strategy. The Shinden sports four excellent 30 mm guns mounted in the nose making it infamous for its head-on capabilities as they are easy to get on target but require a bit of aim control as the guns have low muzzle velocity, as long as you keep your speed high you will become a big threat to the enemy team. The Shinden is able to outrun a myriad of aircraft at its BR with some exceptions being the [[F8F-1B]] and the [[Spitfire F Mk XIVe]] as they have more powerful engines. Enemy bombers such as the [[B-17G-60-VE]] are optimal targets as your main weapons are able to quickly rip through the bombers armour, heavy fighters such as the [[F7F-1]] or the [[Hornet Mk.III]] are targets you may often see at your altitude and make for great prey as they are large and aren't as agile as single-engine fighters. As a Shinden pilot, it is unwise to let the enemy get onto your six o'clock as you aren't likely to shake them with your poor manoeuvrability and the Shinden's engine is mounted in the rear of the plane, meaning any enemy behind you can quickly take you out of the fight just with a few hits to the engine. Like a majority of the Japanese planes, the Shinden lacks any armour to reliable stop bullets from damaging it, however there is a piece of bulletproof glass in the front of the planes cockpit that is 70 mm thick as well as a 16 mm steel plate in the nose, making head-ons a reliable way to kill enemy aircraft as you do not have to worry about enemy bullets hitting your engine. It is highly recommended to avoid participating in dogfights in the Shinden as almost any single prop fighter at its BR will be able to outturn it so it's ideal to stick to energy fighting. The Shinden also has access to 60 kg bombs that can destroy lightly-armoured targets in mixed battles.

In Simulator Battles the Shinden is one of a few planes which gain the ability to preform a "Cobra" manoeuvre and also has the ability to throttle the fuel mixture throttle down enough to kill the engine and stop most engine fires and even some fuel tank fires that it is prone to receiving. Bring the Tracer Belt in most scenarios as all the other belts have practice rounds.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Pilot has some protection in the back from the engine
* Competitive high speed turn rate
* Good roll rate
* Amazing pitch response
* 4 x 30 mm cannons make for some great offensive firepower
* Great high speed, both, handling and dive
* Since the engine and propeller are located in the rear, it is not likely to take damage or catch fire from shots landing at its front

'''Cons:'''

* Slow sustained turn rate
* High speed rudder suffers some compression
* Pilot more exposed at the front.
* Since the engine is located in the rear, it is especially vulnerable to enemies behind it
* Shots to the front may damage its "tail" flaps
* Armament may detonate
* Fuel tanks are easily flammable and do not fully self-seal 
* It's very likely that stalls will be fatal even with unscratched machine 

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The J7W1 Shinden (震電, "Magnificent Lightning") was an Imperial Japanese fighter of WWII that was built near the end of the war in an attempted response to the American B-29 Superfortress bombers. The aircraft used a canard wing formation, (canard wing formation refers to how the main wings are mounted at the rear of the fuselage and smaller wings are placed at the front. Similar to the Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender.) Like the Ascender, the J7W1 was never put into mass-production and was abandoned while still in the prototype stage.<ref>"Kyushu J7W1 Shinden (Magnificent Lightning)." ''National Air and Space Museum'', 18 Apr. 2019, airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/kyushu-j7w1-shinden-magnificent-lightning.</ref>

Developed with the intention of intercepting heavy bombers, it was given 4 nose-mounted 30 mm cannons.

Development of the aircraft began in 1944, but shortages of manufacturing supplies continued to delay its development and testing and the first prototype wasn't completed until April 1945. The Navy placed high hopes in the new model and it was originally hoped that the Kyushu's Zasshonokuma factory and Nakajima's Handa plant would be able to produce over a thousand of the aircraft by 1947.

The prototype first flew on 3 August 1945 from Itazuke Air Base. The plane flew a total of three times, each time as a test flight before it was grounded permanently due to the Japanese surrender and end of the war.

Various parts of the Shinden survived the end of the war and its fuselage can be seen at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.<ref>"Kyushu J7W1/2 'Shinden.'" ''Kyushu J7W1/2 - Shinden'', tanks45.tripod.com/Jets45/Histories/Shinden/Shinden.htm.</ref>
