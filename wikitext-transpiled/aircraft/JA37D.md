== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

The JA37D is a modernized version of the [[JA37C]], introduced in the early 1990s, it served the purpose of modernizing the ageing fleet of Viggens in the Swedish air force and includes various improvements over the previous variant. In game, it includes various improvements, in favour of a better pilot experience as to further improve upon BVR (Beyond Visual Range) engagements and have a better overall combat efficiency rating.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The JA37D, being mainly used for fighter-interceptor purposes, is not equipped with any sort of armour plating against ammunition. While a hit at close range has a high probability of damaging the control systems, a hit from a further distance will probably not cause any considerable damage to the aforementioned controls, however, the fuel tank above the engine does pose a great vulnerability when being fired upon. As a result of the fuel tanks' placement, a fire is a constant threat. Apart from the fuel tanks, the large ailerons are an easy target, and losing a single one will result in loss of control over the aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The JA37D is a highly manoeuvrable aircraft and outperforms most jets in its class, especially at lower altitudes (< 3,000 m). At higher altitudes, the Viggen remains manoeuvrable but, due to its delta-canard configuration, it is prone to losing speed and energy rather fast. This however does not pose much of an issue thanks to the aircraft's effective engine and high rate of acceleration at speeds above 700 km/h and aerodynamics.

In the case of a close range dogfight, you should avoid using AAMs and instead opt for the aircraft's cannon, taking advantage of its high muzzle velocity.

If an enemy positions themselves directly behind you, do not hesitate to use your airbrakes as these are very effective in defensive manoeuvres to regain control of the engagement.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Large amount of countermeasures
* Can carry a drop tank extending the plane's range
* Good acceleration
* Can carry highly manoeuvrable missiles, such as the all-aspect RB74 (Swedish license-built AIM-9L) with a 30G maximum overload

'''Cons:'''

* No tracer rounds making it hard to hit enemy aircraft without prior practice
* Very limited ammo supply with only 150 rounds with no tracer belt options
* No bombs or guided air-to-ground missiles
* The afterburner's fuel consumption is overwhelmingly fast

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The JA37D Viggen is an improved variant of the original JA37 Jaktviggen fighter-interceptor, The D variant of the Viggen first began its production in 1993 and served the Swedish airforce until 2006, with its last flight being in December 2007 during a special air show for the Swedish Air Force. The JA37D features improved, avionics, software systems of the previous JA37C, as a modernization for the ageing airframes.

However one of the main changes for the D variant, were the compatibility to equip and use the Rb 99 Air-To-Air Missile (Swedish designation for the AIM-120 AMRAAM). It could also be equipped with a external ECM pod designated as the "Störkapsel U95".<ref>https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/JA_37</ref><ref>https://www.aef.se/Flygvapnet/Notiser/JA37_Notis_2.htm</ref>  This allowed it to serve until the late 2000s, before being completely replaced by the more advanced JAS 39 Gripen jet fighter.
