== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a Swedish multirole fighter that entered service in 1996 to replace the aging [[JA37D]] and [[AJS37]] for the Swedish air force. The {{PAGENAME}} is developed by SAAB and was designed to carry out tasks such as defending Swedish airspace, engaging with hostile ground targets, and reconnaissance missions.

The {{PAGENAME}} was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]] as top rank jet fighter for Sweden, able to fight toe to toe with [[MiG-29 (Family)|MiG-29]]s and [[F-16 (Family)|F-16]]s on more even terms than the preceding [[JA37D]]. The {{PAGENAME}} can be equipped with different types of anti-air missiles for air engagements, but also does come with different bomb loadouts making it able to be used in a ground supporting role, giving it a multirole ability to engage a variety of enemies. The {{PAGENAME}} handles differently than its predecessor [[JA37D]], but will be more similar to the [[F-16 (Family)|F-16]] that some may be used to.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Gripens needs to be played in one way which is very different from all the other top-tier jets. The JAS39A has an underwhelming radar-guided missile out of all its opponents, meaning it will not play ever in BVR engagements, since it will always end up loosing. Instead, the Gripen shines in the furballs, where the chaos prevents anyone from being totally aware of its surroundings. There, it can use its two best assets: the RB 74(M) (AIM-9M copy-paste) and the nearly-unlimited flares loadout the plane can carry. When approaching the danger zone, activate the automatic countermeasure release, set to cycle 1 sec with 0.5 sec between each release and 2 releases per cycle. You have about 4:30 minutes of pure adrenaline before you run out of flares (using flares and chaff should half the time, but sticking to the deck makes radar-guided missiles easily dodgeable). Now the player can pay less (not none) attention to their surroundings and focus on launching the RB 74(M) missiles. Do not focus too much on one target, lock on with radar so the missile won't go for the flares during the lock-on phase and prefer targets that are showing you their side: this way even if they flare the missile will be less likely to notice the flares at all.
The Gripen is also a good dogfighter, use the air brake until you get into the 700-850 km/h, that way you will pull like a monster.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High speed; good acceleration gets you back in the fight after losing speed in turns or climbs
* Extreme manoeuvrability - currently possibly the most agile fighter in the game, outturns even F-16s!
* High amount of countermeasures available; a total of 720 when carrying four BOL rails on the wings
* Well balanced loadouts available, ranging from dumb bombs and rockets to F&F AGMs and laser guided bombs
* Helmet mounted sight lets the pilot slew both IR missile seekers as well as the radar onto off-bore targets
* Access to very competitive RB74(M) missiles which are highly resistant to flares

'''Cons:'''

* Prone to tear off wings at high speed; its high agility may result in over-G breaking the plane apart with reckless manoeuvring
* Mediocre radar missiles; very short range compared to the AIM-7Ms and R-27ERs carried by contemporaries
* Low ammo count for a relatively rapid firing cannon
* Canard-delta design combined with its tiny size means that any hit is likely to cause critical damage to your flight surfaces
