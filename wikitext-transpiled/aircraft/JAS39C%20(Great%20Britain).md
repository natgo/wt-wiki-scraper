== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the early 1980s, the South African Air Force (SAAF) was looking for a replacement for its aging Cheetah fleet, which was a locally upgraded version of the French [[Mirage III (Family)|Mirage III]]. The Cheetahs were subject to an arms embargo due to the apartheid regime, which limited their availability and effectiveness. In 1999, after a long and controversial procurement process, South Africa signed a contract with Saab for 26 Gripens (17 JAS39C and 9 JAS39D), becoming the first export customer of the type. The delivery of the South African Gripens started in 2008 and was completed in 2012. Since then, the South African Gripens have been involved in several operations, both at home and abroad. In 2010, they secured the airspace during the FIFA World Cup hosted by South Africa. In 2013, they provided air support for South African peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and also participated in the funeral of Nelson Mandela, the former president and anti-apartheid leader. However, the South African Gripens have faced some challenges in their service, such as budget constraints, maintenance issues, and political controversies. Due to the high cost of operating the jets, the SAAF has limited their flying hours and reduced their operational readiness. The SAAF has also struggled to maintain the jets' spare parts and technical support, which have been affected by the corruption allegations against Saab. Furthermore, the Gripen deal has been criticized by some sectors of society as unnecessary and wasteful, especially in light of the country's social and economic problems. These issues became more evident when South Africa had to ground its fleet of Gripens in September 2021 due to budget cuts and maintenance problems, which led to concerns about the country's air defense capabilities.

The {{Specs|name}} was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]]. As the first South African jet in the tree, it proves worthy of its place due to its exceptional flight performance and loadout capabilities. It has a high-performance engine and a high thrust-to-weight ratio, which gives it excellent acceleration and climb rate, as well as superb agility and energy retention. It can also carry a variety of weapons for all kinds of situations, including guided bombs, AGM-65 Mavericks, active radar homing R-Darter and IR AIM-9M missiles. It's downsides are few, but noticeable: it's mainly a dogfighter and taking too much weight will nullify its strengths, and its radar, while practically inescapable, has poor accuracy.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
{{Notice|Flight performance of this plane has been changed several times since its release, however most sections remain valid after these changes.}}

The Gripen is really simple to fly, as it has nearly all mechanics on automatic controls. Use of airbrakes is manual and is recommended when the plane is diving down, especially if pilot is about to pass out, otherwise the plane might lock up and crash into ground like a meteor.

With only light anti-air weaponry, the plane easily accelerates to 1100 km/h even without afterburner, with afterburner it is possible to reach 1500 km/h (nearing self-destruct speed) and further in a level flight.

Currently, the JAS39 family remains as the best dogfighter in game (However this is closely followed by the [[F-16A]] Block 10 and to a lesser extent, the Block 15 and 20 variants), and this mostly shows in three situations:

*It has an extreme turn rate even with afterburner on, allowing to do a 180 degree turn on a whim when completely researched. This, however, can make the pilot pass out. Despite having a delta wing, the Gripen still has good energy retention at almost all speed ranges.
*It's possible to destabilize the plane and fall into a flat spin, however the chances of this are minimal.
*Even when damage is taken, the plane remains agile and continues to hold its own in a dogfight.

Taking heavy bombs will severely hamper its flight performance. Consider using ATGMs instead, unless absolutely necessary.

Enemies worth noting:

* [[F-16C]] - The F-16C carries the highly dangerous [[AIM-120A|AIM-120]] missiles which out range the R-Darter by a large amount. However at close ranges the difference becomes much less noticeable. In a dogfight the F-16C is simply no match for the Gripen (Assuming similar pilot skill).
* [[F-16AM (France)]] - The F-16AM has all the advantages of the previously mentioned F-16C, however the F-16AM has superior flight performance compared to the F-16C and is close to the Gripen in a close range dogfight, though the Gripen still has the advantage.
* [[Su-27 (Family)|Su-27]] (All variants) - The Su-27 family have the ability to carry up to 10 missiles and is a very dangerous opponent at longer ranges, at close ranges its HMD+[[R-73]] combination continues to be a major threat but due to the Gripen's large number of countermeasures, this is less of a issue, though still dangerous. The Su-27's flight performance in a dogfight is much inferior to the Gripen as long as the Gripen is able to evade the Su-27 in the first/second turn where the Su-27 is able to pull very high AOA and launch its [[R-73]] missiles. 
* [[F-15C MSIP II]] - The F-15C is able to carry a loadout of 4x [[AIM-120A|AIM-120]] + 4x [[AIM-9M Sidewinder|AIM-9M]] missiles, making it very deadly in both long range and close range engagements
* [[Mirage 2000-5F]] - The Mirage 2000-5F carries the [[Matra R550 Magic 2]] missiles as well as the [[MICA-EM]] missiles, both of which are extremely dangerous in a close range combat, any close range engagement with the Mirage 2000-5F should be approached with extreme caution. While the Gripen remains noticeably superior in terms of flight performance, the Mirage 2000-5F will be able to keep on with the Gripen until low speeds where the difference in flight performance gets larger.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Gripen itself is rather fragile, but unlike most early delta wings British players might be familiar with it has a lot of redundant controls and even the canards on the front alone can keep the plane alive for a minute. Loss of flaps on the back can seriously hamper the ability to turn, but the plane will try to adapt. Losing half the wing will likely cause the plane to spin and crash, but pilot can fight it.
[[File:Unkillable gripen counterattacks.jpg|thumb|right|As long as Gripen still has at least one working flap and the canards, it can demonstrate truly horrific feats of defiance]]
Taking heavy hit to the cockpit or the engine is generally fatal, but in case of engine fire the plane can still use remaining energy to fight or attempt to put out the fire via use of the EFS.

One of the most important parts of this plane defences are the countermeasure pods - this plane by default has 80 large countermeasures and in its anti-air loadout it can have a large number of small countermeasures under its wings (up to 640). Even when firing countermeasures every 0.5 seconds (which is already enough to confuse AIM-9M and some ARH missiles) without any care in the world, the plane is unlikely to run out of countermeasures before every player on enemy team was already destroyed. Even when firing every 0.2 seconds (which increases survival chances against multiple opponents), the countermeasures tend to only run out once the plane is out of weapons to keep fighting anyway.

On top of high amount of countermeasures, the plane has a rather low engine temperature when the afterburner is offline, which makes it slightly easier to lose the IR missiles with the use of flares.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Akan m/85 (27 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 27 mm Akan m/85 cannon, belly-mounted (120 rpg)
* 92 x large calibre countermeasures

The cannon is similar to 27 mm Mauser used on the [[Tornado F.3]] with barely enough ammunition to destroy 4 planes, but it has significantly better ammunition. Belts have PELE-T shells mixed in, which are basically a better APHE (twice the explosive mass and explode backwards after destroying hit module) and anti-air belt has 2 HEF shells. Overall, the ammunition is extremely good at setting planes on fire, even if not always inherently lethal.

Radar gun assist is a bit weak due to the strong but unfocused radar - while it is next to impossible to shake it off (and very difficult to chaff), it will most of the time only work at 1.2 km and will fail to actually provide a correct aim prediction. With a gun convergence of 600 m, pilot must aim slightly ahead of the enemy plane to actually score a hit from the side.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{Navigation-End}}

The Gripen has a lot of ammunition types, but you need to make a choice of what exactly are you going to do in your current battle. Two outer points (wingtips) are used for AIM-9L/M, while middle hardpoints can either carry anti-air missiles with countermeasure pods, or anti-ground weapons like bombs or ATGM. On the fuselage, an optional LITENING II or a fuel tank can be equipped.

In anti-air section, AIM-9M and R-Darter are the most interesting options. Both missiles can be used with TWS and HMD radar mode, which makes them very versatile and quite hard to detect.

AIM-9M is a smokeless IR missile that shuts off its seeker when it sees flares and tries to intercept the plane on its last known course instead of just flying wherever it wants to like the 9L, which makes it incredibly difficult to evade without consistent flare spam (and not many planes have near-infinite flares like with the British ones).

R-Darter is an ARH missile, meaning it has radar built into it and will attack planes on its own after establishing a lock. The missile is best described as Skyflash SuperTemp on steroids, as it doesn't even require sustained lock-on to fire (TWS soft lock or a brief HMD lock is enough), is extremely agile and will relentlessly pursue and obliterate anything even off-screen within its optimal range, starting from 1.5 km and ending with about 13 km. Main strength of the missile is that it has longer booster stage than others, which allows it to be more active at closer ranges and when attacking from behind. The missile lock-on range is about 16 km, but it will do its best to trace chosen target until then by using IOG instead of self-destructing, though when launched at a target from very far away, it will try to loft (fly in space to then fall down) and will naively spend all of its energy on actively turning enemies, so using R-Darter at a long range is not recommended (unless fired from space to begin with). The missile will use DL (data link) to correct itself and report it's own progress (during this, the assumed target is marked by a "circle" on radar display, which disappears when the missile actually locks on and doesn't need further help), basically being also linked to the plane's radar the whole time, which makes it visible on the radar display and lets it to take notes every time TWS (or even a direct lock-on) paints the chosen target.

In anti-ground section, AGM-65G are the most interesting addition to already known ammunition (same as on Harrier GR.7). It's essentially a giant SAP shell, filled with so much explosives that it might as well be HE. Since it's IR guided, it is fire-and-forget type of launch and can be used at night. One of it's major downsides is that it could in theory be intercepted by APS or blocked off by smoke screens, unlike a regular or laser bomb.

The {{PAGENAME}} is the crown jewel of the British Aviation tech tree, sitting at one whole Battle Rating above any and all other planes. It is the most versatile fighter, ground striker, dogfighter and interceptor out of the British tree, and one of the most capable planes in game, thanks to its amazing manoeuvrability, low speed flight characteristics and suite of ordnance. While it can use a combination of IR missiles, radar missiles, guided bombs and AGMs, it does not feature more than 4 fully customizable hardpoints, along with the 2x AIM-9Ms from the wingtips. this means that you can have one radar missile, one IR missile with Countermeasures pod, one guided bomb and one AGM, ontop of fuel and a LITENING II targetting pod. The ability to take such custom loadouts makes this plane very versatile and suitable for a large number of roles in Air-to-Air combat and Air-to-Ground combat.

As a fighter, Gripen has a different role than [[Tornado F.3 Late]] - while Tornado is mainly focusing on abusing its extremely strong TWS radar and AIM-120B for long range combat (as it is lacking the mobility required for serious close range battles), the Gripen is all about getting relatively close and personal.

;Air Realistic battles:

This plane should carry 6 missiles. Two wingtip AIM-9L/M which should always be carried. On the remaining 4 hardpoints, the {{PAGENAME}} can take any combination of AIM-9L/M, AIM-9L/M on Countermeasure pods (which is obviously preferred over the AIM-9L/M with no countermeasure pods), or the same with R-Darter Radar missiles instead. The best combination and missile balance is decided by the user, though R-Darter is more inherently lethal and versatile, at a cost of being mildly vulnerable to chaff.

The Gripen is a very fuel efficient plane. You can fly it extra light at minimum fuel (9 minutes) along with the fuel pod if you do not plan to afterburn all the way to the middle of the map. This fuel loadout ensures you are the lightest possible, while giving you enough fighting time. You can always drop the fuel tank to become insanely nimble, however you should not drop below 2 minutes of fuel. You can get back to base with around 1 minute if you climb, keep your speed and start from high speed from the middle of the map, however 2 minutes insures you can also defend yourself in case anyone chases you. You can take any combination of fuel + fuel pod, however you should not have more than 30 minutes of total fuel. Flight performance suffers with more than 25 minutes of total fuel.

It should be noted that the Gripen, as a very small fighter with an efficient engine is a very cold target compared to dual-engine fighters that can fight against it, giving enemies a very hard time locking IR missiles on it, and making it very easy to defend against IR missiles.

The Gripen maximum effective range is 20 km, and most planes with long-range ARH missiles prefer to start firing from 30 km, so getting close to the enemy team can be a bit tricky. To counteract this, use super wide TWS mode of the radar, which allows to scan 70 degrees horizontally on both sides (much wider than on most planes). Set the detection range to 74 km, fly low and deflect as far away from the enemy flight direction (and, preferrably, teammates), as the tracker allows. This will allow you to avoid attention of the majority of enemies, while keeping you informed both about your targets and anyone on the other side. Once the targets approach the last quarter of the radar (19 km range), enter ACM radar mode, set it to a "line" or "look up" mode (depending on who you want to attack first) and sneak as close to them as feasible using terrain (if there is no terrain, attempt to flank and blindside them, unless someone is trying to lock onto you already, then send a missile towards that pilot first) and turn on the periodic countermeasure release, since you definitely do not want to be caught without it running during combat. DO NOT fight at close range using TWS, as the scan rate and accuracy of Gripen radar is very low and this will get you killed.

{{Notice|If you disable the radar lock or turn the radar off manually in ACM mode, rather than just lose the target, the Gripen will default to HMD mode when it will be turned back on again. This is crucial to remember when the enemy is still beyond vision range, as while it is convenient to attack multiple planes via HMD once they were detected by ACM, the HMD scan area is very small, and swapping between them takes time.}}

After getting within operational range, the Gripen can be used in multiple ways:

* Furball Fighter - Taking a full load of missiles and countermeasures. Periodic flares can be used this way along with the relatively cold engine of the Gripen, making you almost invulnerable to IR missiles. This however means than you want to be as light as possible, so taking minimum fuel and dropping the fuel pod as you enter the fight is very crucial. You should then target enemies that are not spamming flares with AIM-9M and crash anything too agressive with R-Darters. If the AIM-9M has at least 2-3 seconds of flight without seeing one flare, it is pretty much guaranteed to hit. If a lot of people are trying to set up for a head-on, you can literally destroy half of the enemy party with R-Darters before they can even get an angle on you, as R-darter can intercept targets that arent even on your screen. You can even fire at their backs as they begin their loops, but you need to check if enemy is using chaff a lot and you will have to use HMD and may accidentally crash into ground if not paying attention, so take care
* Interceptor - This involves taking R-Darter missiles and trying to pick off targets by firing at them via TWS or by sneaking on them from low ground and firing into their face from 10 km away. It is very effective because R-Darter has stupidly high manoeuvrability while it has a booster, and multiple planes can be blasted in one volley since they are ARH and do not require babysitting after initial lock like the Skyflashes. Since R-Darter lofts (goes up to fall down) really hard and doesn't turn much after the booster is gone, it is not very good for long range fights (planes with AIM-120A will win in any fair fight), but you technically can fire it at targets that are 20 km away and going along the ground or behind a mountain while you are also on at the same elevation without exposing yourself overly much (it will go up, lock on and then fall on them from about 30 degree angle). It also can conserve energy when chasing someone from behind by looming above them, so if enemy pilot gets distracted for 10 seconds it will fall on their face. Sometimes, when fired from about 25 km, the R-Darters will just find and kill their targets on their own, but keeping the TWS or lock on a plane will reduce possibility of chaff and aerobatics working on it.

If you are forced to directly fight a plane at long range (for example, someone spotted and singled you out), and you are sure that this is a 1v1 situation, you can use their tactics against themselves. Generally, the strategy for the planes with long-range missiles like the AIM-120A (at least, for good pilots) is to launch a missile at you and then turn away to spoof whatever you send back at them. What you want to do in such situation is to lock onto their missile instead, obliterate it with the R-Darter of your own and chase after them. Once you get within 6-7 km range, they can do absolutely nothing, as they are caught out of position against a missile that has a long booster stage aided by a radar with high resistance to chaff, meaning no matter how hard they hit the afterburner and go down after that, it will not save them. This will not help against people who will try to "triple tap" you just to make sure you are dead, but this is extremely unlikely unless it's an endgame standoff.

The Gripen is one of the best suited planes in Air Realistic due to its low heat signature, low fuel consumption, HMD, and strong IR missiles, However this does not mean it is not as good in:

;Ground Realistic Battles:

The Gripen has access to a good variety of guided munitions. You can chose between using GBU-12s, GBU-16s and GBU-24s (only on the inner-most pylons) and AGM-65B/Gs which can all be guided with the LITENING II targetting pod. One of the best targetting pods in war thunder, with good thermal sight resolution. This gives the Gripen the ability to take out any ground target effectively, and still be able to engage enemy Air due to its wingtip AIM-9M missiles, which effectiveness is much greater in ground battles due to the AIM-9M's smokeless motors, meaning it is effectively invisible as it approaches the target so the enemy may not be able to pop countermeasures soon enough to wave it off.

When using this plane in GRB, taking one to two AGMs is a good idea, in order to take out enemy SPAA as quickly as possible. AGMs are preferred over GBUs due to their fire and forget nature, and higher speed.

Taking out enemy SPAAs such as the Pantsir-S1 is the first thing you should do when you spawn in. The AGMs should be fired from a maximum of 8 km, and if possible 6 km. If more than 5-10 seconds pass and you have not fired an AGM at an enemy SPAA, you should instantly dive while turning the other way. After going outside of the enemy SPAA range (18 km max) you should sideclimb and get to a comfortable altitude. Try to take out the the enemy SPAA again with the AGMs. do note that they have higher range if fired from higher altitude.

After dealing with SPAA, You can start dropping GBUs or use AGM-65G, but you need to keep in mind that another SPAA can spawn in at any moment and lock you in the IRST mode, so you should always look at the ground, and always fly defensively if possible, putting objects or terrain between you and the enemy ground spawns, keeping your speed up or not flying into straight lines for too long.

;Simulator Battles:

The Gripen is a very strong plane to use in simulator battles. It gets access to a lot of countermeasures, smokeless missiles, making them quite invisible even if enemies look at you when you fire in the right conditions. You get access to a good HUD that gives good information, the HMD which is amazing in SIM, a targetting pod on its own hardpoint, which is good for spotting, and a pretty good radar, with good search sectors, range and modes. TWS should be used rather than PD.

The only downside is that the Gripen has a black line running in the middle of the glass canopy, effectively cutting your visibility when in a dogfight, and the fact that it only has access to 6 missiles.

It is one of the best SIM planes due to its very stable canard design, smokeless motors and HMD. Flight performance is a bonus.

The British variant of the Gripen is identical to the Swedish Gripen, other than name and camouflages, and is one of the best planes in War Thunder due to its insanely good flight performance, good ordnance variety, strong air-to-air IR missiles and large amount of countermeasures on top of other smaller strengths. It is a plane that has very high potential and can win any situation. This is not a plane that will limit the one who is piloting it.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very capable AIM-9M missiles, which include a seeker shutoff IRCCM and smokeless motor
* An extremely agile R-Darter ARH missile will absolutely destroy any target (including other missiles) at short to medium range
* Can attack with missiles at almost any angle it wants to, as it has access to HMD and the missiles don't really require a consistent lock-on most of the time
* Extremely nimble and capable plane, which can pull off one-of-a-kind manoeuvres
* Can be extremely difficult to kill
** lots of countermeasures, more than most players will ever need
** Able to turn, aim and fire even on the brink of death
** High performance and low temperature engine makes it hard to lock the plane and gives enough thrust to keep fighting at the same time
* High variety of ordnance including GBUs, AGMs, countermeasure pods and a good targeting pod
* A decent range radar that is nearly impossible to chaff
* Has special ammunition for its gun, mildly better than the other 27 mm

'''Cons:'''

* Can only carry a maximum of 6 missiles, anti-ground ammunition removes a missile and a countermeasure pod
* Flying it without care can cause blackout
* Flight performance suffers greatly if damaged or carrying heavy bombs
* Missiles are not particularly good at long range
* Not impossible to run out of fuel, but taking too much fuel makes the plane less agile (can be solved by bringing fuel tanks, but that requires more keybinds)
* TWS radar mode scan speed and accuracy is very poor, particularly at close range

In the late 1990s, South Africa found a need to replace its aging fleet of Mirage and Cheetah fighter jets. Looking to modernize their fleet for not only national defense, but for a better standing for their defense modernization and strategic autonomy in the global stage, South Africa sought options in the market under the Advanced Light Fighter Aircraft (ALFA) program. The decision was made and announced in November 1998 that the Swedish-made Gripen has been chosen to fulfill the program's need, with 28 Gripens to be purchased at a price of 1.5 billion USD in 1999 (this would be changed to 26 Gripens in 2005). Alongside the purchase deal was South Africa's involvement with Saab's Industrial Participation programme, which enabled South Africa's local industries to help produce and maintain Gripen parts, such as Denel Aviation producing the rear fuselage sections of the Gripen.

South Africa received their first Gripen in 2006. The aircraft, a two-seater Gripen-D, was sent to the Test Flight Development Centre in the Southern Cape for full testing and integration of South African avionics and weapons for the country. Once fully tested and handed over to the South African Air Force (SAAF) in 2008, deliveries of Gripens directly to the South African Air Force began in the same year. By 2011, 17 Gripen-Cs and 9 Gripen-Ds have been delivered to the SAAF and equipped the 2 Squadron, located at AFB Makhado in the Limpopo province.

Although the Gripens have not yet been involved with any heavy fighting in South Africa, they have been integral to maintaining the country's air superiority. Gripens were deployed during several high-profile events in South Africa, such as during the 2010 FIFA World Cup to maintain airspace security and protection and in 2013 to escort Nelson Mandela's remains to his funeral processions and maintain no-fly zones during the funeral.

However, financial constraints have cast a shadow over the fleet's operational sustainability, leading to a notable incident in September 2021 when the Gripens were grounded due to lack of funding and maintenance and support contracts not being renewed in time. This would be resolved by September 2022, enabling the Gripens to fly again, though concerns remain on the pilot readiness after a year of grounding.
