== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In the late 1990s, after the fall of the USSR, many former Warsaw Pact countries were left looking for NATO-compatible fighters, but their political climate (or financial standings) did not allow for the purchase of advanced American-made airframes such as the [[F-16 (Family)|F-16]] or [[F-15 (Family)|F-15]]. To capitalise on this, SAAB decided to pursue an "upgraded" variant of their existing JAS39 aircraft which would fill two criteria: to update the Gripens to the same standard as the latest [[F-16C]]s in USAF inventory, giving them the required technology to fulfil the requirements of the Swedish Air Force at the time, and also to add more NATO interoperability and compatibility for more ordnance and mid-air refueling, allowing the new Gripen to easily integrate into many former Warsaw Pact countries which were now joining NATO. This new standard of Gripen, called the '''JAS39C''', would first take to the skies on September 6th, 2002. While this new Gripen failed to attract as many buyers as the venerable F-16, it still found fulfilment for its original task, by helping nations like Hungary and the Czech Republic to replace their outdated MiGs with a more modern, NATO-compatible airframe.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a Swedish 4th generation fighter introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]] to the top ranks of the Swedish tree. Its main difference over the previous [[JAS39A]] is its new avionics and armament, primarily the introduction of a glass cockpit with massive colour displays, replacing the old analogue instruments, and more importantly, the addition of the RB 99 missile, a Swedish licensed copy of the AIM-120A AMRAAM active-radar homing missile. This new missile, which is also compatible with the BOL countermeasures dispenser (giving the Gripen over 700 countermeasures) and a Helmet-Cued Radar Boresight targeting system, coupled with the Gripen's already incredible flight performance thanks to its small profile and lightweight airframe, makes the JAS39C an extremely formidable aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to RB74(M) missiles which are highly resistant to flares
* Access to very competitive RB99 missiles with an ARH seeker with very long range
* Helmet Mounted sight lets the pilot slave both IR seekers as well as the radar onto off-bore targets

* High amount of countermeasures available; a total of 732 when carrying four BOL rails on the wings
* Extreme manoeuvrability - one of the most agile fighter in the game

*

'''Cons:'''

* Low ammo count for a relatively rapid firing cannon
* Mediocre amount of ARH missiles in comparison to the competition (4 ARH missiles Vs 6 ARH missiles)
