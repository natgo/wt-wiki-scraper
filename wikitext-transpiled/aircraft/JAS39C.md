<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the early 1980s, the South African Air Force (SAAF) was looking for a replacement for its aging Cheetah fleet, which was a locally upgraded version of the French [[Mirage III (Family)|Mirage III]]. The Cheetahs were subject to an arms embargo due to the apartheid regime, which limited their availability and effectiveness. In 1999, after a long and controversial procurement process, South Africa signed a contract with Saab for 26 Gripens (17 JAS39C and 9 JAS39D), becoming the first export customer of the type. The delivery of the South African Gripens started in 2008 and was completed in 2012. Since then, the South African Gripens have been involved in several operations, both at home and abroad. In 2010, they secured the airspace during the FIFA World Cup hosted by South Africa. In 2013, they provided air support for South African peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and also participated in the funeral of Nelson Mandela, the former president and anti-apartheid leader. However, the South African Gripens have faced some challenges in their service, such as budget constraints, maintenance issues, and political controversies. Due to the high cost of operating the jets, the SAAF has limited their flying hours and reduced their operational readiness. The SAAF has also struggled to maintain the jets' spare parts and technical support, which have been affected by the corruption allegations against Saab. Furthermore, the Gripen deal has been criticized by some sectors of society as unnecessary and wasteful, especially in light of the country's social and economic problems. These issues became more evident when South Africa had to ground its fleet of Gripens in September 2021 due to budget cuts and maintenance problems, which led to concerns about the country's air defense capabilities.

The {{Specs|name}} was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]]. As the first South African jet in the tree, it proves worthy of its place due to its exceptional flight performance and loadout capabilities. It has a high-performance engine and a high thrust-to-weight ratio, which gives it excellent acceleration and climb rate, as well as superb agility and energy retention. It can also carry a variety of weapons, including guided bombs, AGM-65 Mavericks, and AIM-9M Sidewinders. However, its main drawback is its Skyflash radar missiles, which are inferior to other top-tier missiles in terms of range, speed, and manoeuvrability.

The {{PAGENAME}} is the crown jewel of the British Aviation tech tree, sitting at one whole Battle Rating above any and all other planes. It is the most capable fighter, ground striker, dogfighter and interceptor out of the British tree, and one of the most capable planes in game, thanks to its amazing manoeuvrability, low speed flight characteristics and suite of ordinance. While it can use a combination of IR missiles, radar missiles, guided bombs and AGMs, it does not feature more than 4 fully customizable hardpoints, along with the 2x AIM-9Ms from the wingtips. this means that you can have one radar missile, one IR missile with Countermeasures pod, one guided bomb and one AGM, ontop of fuel and a LITENING II targetting pod. The ability to take such custom loadouts makes this plane very versatile and suitable for a large number of roles in Air-to-Air combat and Air-to-Ground combat.

;Air Realistic battles:

This plane should carry 6 missiles. Two wingtip AIM-9M which should always be carried. On the remaining 4 hardpoints, the {{PAGENAME}} can take any combination of AIM-9M, AIM-9M on Countermeasure pods (which is strongly preferred over the AIM-9M with no countermeasure pods), and Skyflash Radar missiles. Do note that the Skyflash missiles, while capable when used correctly, are not as good as the competition. Each AI<-9M is increasing the number of small countermeasures by x160 with each pylon. therefore, you should always include at least one Aim-9M with a CM pod on the 4 pylons, so you can more than double the amount of countermeasures. The best combination is decided by the user. However you should always include at least one AIM-9M or one Skyflash, so you can have a good number of countermeasures, and be able to engage targets further than the AIM-9M can. 

The Gripen is a very fuel efficient plane. You can fly it extra light at minimum fuel (9 minutes) along with the fuel pod if you do not plan to afterburn all the way to the middle of the map. This fuel loadout ensures you are the lightest possible, while giving you enough fighting time. You can always drop the fuel tank to become insanely nimble, however you should not drop below 2 minutes of fuel. You can get back to base with around 1 minute if you climb, keep your speed and start from high speed from the middle of the map, however 2 minutes insures you can also defend yourself in case anyone chases you. You can take any combination of fuel + fuel pod, however you should not have more than 30 minutes of total fuel. Flight performance suffers with more than 25 minutes of total fuel.

It should be noted that the Gripen, as a very small fighter with an efficient engine is a very cold target compared to dual-engine fighters that can fight against it, giving enemies a very hard time locking IR missiles on it, and making it very easy to defend against IR missiles.

The Gripen can be used in multiple ways:

* Furball Fighter - Taking a full load of 6x AIM-9M missiles and countermeasures. Periodic flares can be used this way along with the relatively cold engine of the Gripen, making you almost invulnerable to IR missiles. This however means than you want to be as light as possible, so taking minimum fuel and dropping the fuel pod as you enter the fight is very crucial. You should then target enemies that are not spamming flares. If the AIM-9M has at least 2-3 seconds of flight without seeing one flare, it is pretty much a guaranteed to hit. You can also take one Skyflash missile to guarantee you a hit head-on if used at the right time. Using your HMD is crucial in this situation.
* Interceptor - This involves taking one to three Skyflash missiles and trying to pick off targets in headons, or climbing targets at a maximum of 8-11 km range depending on altitudes. It is a very strong a well rounded loadout. You should keep your speed with this loadout, and try to play in more of a support role. 

The Gripen is one of, if not the best, Air Realistic Planes due to its low heat signature, low fuel consumption, HMD, and strong IR missiles, However this does not mean it is not as good in:

;Ground Realistic Battles:

The Gripen has access to a good variety of guided munitions. You can chose between using GBU-12s, GBU-16s and GBU-24s (only on the inner-most pylons) and AGM-65B's which can all be guided with the LITENING II targetting pod. One of the best Targetting pods in war thunder, with good thermal sight resolution. This gives the Gripen the ability to take out any ground target effectively, and still be able to engage enemy Air due to its wingtip AIM-9M missiles, which effectiveness is much greater in ground battles due to the AIM-9M's smokeless motors, meaning it is effectively invisible as it approaches the target so the enemy may not be able to pop countermeasures soon enough to wave it off.

When using this plane in GRB, taking one to two AGM's is a good idea, in order to take out enemy SPAA as quickly as possible. AGMs are preferred over GBUs due to their fire and forget nature, and higher speed.

Taking out enemy SPAA's such as the Pantsir-S1 is the first thing you should do when you spawn in. The AGMs should be fired from a maximum of 8 km, and if possible 6 km. If more than 5-10 seconds pass and you have not fired an AGM at an enemy SPAA, you should instantly dive while turning the other way. After going outside of the enemy SPAA range (18km max) you should sideclimb and get to a comfortable altitude. Try to take out the the enemy SPAA again with the AGMs. do note that they have higher range if fired from higher altitude. 

After dealing with SPAA, You can start dropping GBU's, but you need to keep in mind that another SPAA can spawn in at any moment and lock you in the IRST mode, so you should always look at the ground, and always fly defensively if possible, putting objects or terrain between you and the enemy ground spawns, keeping your speed up or not flying into straight lines for too long.

;Simulator Battles:

The Gripen is a very strong plane to use in simulator battles. It gets access to a lot of countermeasures, smokeless missiles, making them quite invisible even if enemies look at you when you fire in the right conditions. You get access to a good HUD that gives good information, the HMD which is amazing in SIM, a targetting pod on it's own hardpoint, which is good for spotting, and a pretty good radar, with good search sectors, range and modes. TWS should be used rather than PD simple PD. 

The only downside is that the gripen has a black line running in the middle of the glass canopy, effectively cutting your visibility when in a dogfight, and the fact that it only has access to 6 missiles.

It is one of the best SIM planes due to its very stable canard design, smokeless motors and HMD. Flight performance is a bonus.

The British variant of the Gripen is identical to the Swedish Gripen, other than name and camouflages, and is one of if not the best plane in War Thunder As of the Update "Air Superiority" due to its insanely good flight performance, good ordinance variety, strong Air-to-Air IR missiles and large amount of countermeasures on top of other smaller strengths. It is a plane that has very high potential and can win any situation. This is not a plane that will limit the one who is piloting it.

In the late 1990s, South Africa found a need to replace its aging fleet of Mirage and Cheetah fighter jets. Looking to modernize their fleet for not only national defense, but for a better standing for their defense modernization and strategic autonomy in the global stage, South Africa sought options in the market under the Advanced Light Fighter Aircraft (ALFA) program. The decision was made and announced in November 1998 that the Swedish-made Gripen has been chosen to fulfill the program's need, with 28 Gripens to be purchased at a price of 1.5 billion USD in 1999 (this would be changed to 26 Gripens in 2005). Alongside the purchase deal was South Africa's involvement with Saab's Industrial Participation programme, which enabled South Africa's local industries to help produce and maintain Gripen parts, such as Denel Aviation producing the rear fuselage sections of the Gripen.

South Africa received their first Gripen in 2006. The aircraft, a two-seater Gripen-D, was sent to the Test Flight Development Centre in the Southern Cape for full testing and integration of South African avionics and weapons for the country. Once fully tested and handed over to the South African Air Force (SAAF) in 2008, deliveries of Gripens directly to the South African Air Force began in the same year. By 2011, 17 Gripen-Cs and 9 Gripen-Ds have been delivered to the SAAF and equipped the 2 Squadron, located at AFB Makhado in the Limpopo province.

Although the Gripens have not yet been involved with any heavy fighting in South Africa, they have been integral to maintaining the country's air superiority. Gripens were deployed during several high-profile events in South Africa, such as during the 2010 FIFA World Cup to maintain airspace security and protection and in 2013 to escort Nelson Mandela's remains to his funeral processions and maintain no-fly zones during the funeral. 

However, financial constraints have cast a shadow over the fleet's operational sustainability, leading to a notable incident in September 2021 when the Gripens were grounded due to lack of funding and maintenance and support contracts not being renewed in time. This would be resolved by September 2022, enabling the Gripens to fly again, though concerns remain on the pilot readiness after a year of grounding.
