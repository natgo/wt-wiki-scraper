== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Due to the advent of the latest US and Russian strike aircraft projects of the time, such as the F-15E and the Su-34, China quickly realized their Q-5 fleet was technologically behind. Building a new supersonic heavy strike aircraft was no easy task, especially for China which had started the program lacking the required technological advancements to complete it. The development program began in the late 1980s as China aimed to bolster its naval aviation capabilities. This twin-engine, two-seat fighter-bomber was designed by the Nanchang Aircraft Corporation and later upgraded by the Xi'an Aircraft Corporation. The initial variant, the JH-7, first flew in 1988. It was equipped with a variety of systems, including the JL-10A radar and various electronic countermeasures, making it a versatile platform for ground attack and maritime strike missions. The JH-7 program faced many challenges, but by 1992, the first serial production variant of the JH-7, the '''JH-7A''', officially entered service, where it played a significant role in modernizing China's naval air forces and showcasing their ambitions in the world of military aviation. While not as famous as other strike aircraft of its era, the JH-7 series is a noteworthy example of China's incredible strides in defense technology.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (歼轰-7A型歼击轰炸机; unified NATO reporting name: ''Flounder'') was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. Being a dedicated strike-fighter, the JH-7A specializes in the ground-strike role, and suffers in dedicated air-to-air combat at its battle rating, despite having access to the formidable [[PL-8]] and [[PL-5C]] all aspect missiles. As such, this aircraft can struggle in dedicated air modes, and instead shines the brightest in mixed battles thanks to its selection of precision ground ordnance and powerful targeting pod. The strong radar and all-aspect missiles can prove to be a strong form of self-defence in mixed battles if the need arises. All in all, the JH-7A serves as a major upgrade in technology and capability over its predecessors in the tech tree, namely the Q-5 family.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
At first glance, players will see some similarities between the JH-7A and Jaguar, the latter being one of the targets the JH-7 aimed for during design (the other is Tornado IDS for its great payload). Due to the need to carry heavy ordnance such as AShMs and future provisions for AGMs, the JH-7A's size is still one of the largest among domestically designed PLANAF/PLAAF jets (even the largest J-20 is shorter than JH-7A by 2 metres). To mitigate the possible problems from its sheer size, the JH-7 series are powered by two FWS-9 Qinling turbofan engines (licensed Rolls-Royce Spey RB.168 Mk.202), with the JH-7A eventually using the completely domestic version. As such, it not only provides very high acceleration at any altitude, it can also maintain manoeuvrability when it has the need for occasional dogfights; thanks to the high wing design, it does have higher instantaneous AoA when facing manoeuvring targets. The very high acceleration also helps to push the jet to up to Mach 1.6 with only AAMs. It can still fly at supersonic speeds even at full-load; this also enables JH-7A to get to enemy bases as fast as it possible with sufficient payload for 2 bases.

However, the high wing design also brings a potentially fatal trait: poor low-speed and low-altitude manoeuvrability. This is a trait that also costed lives of PLAAF/PLANAF pilots as high wing jets will lose lift in the aforementioned scenarios, mostly during recovery from ground attacks or landing, thus players have to be more careful during such cases; if the terrain doesn't allow for a safe attack run, it's better to recover earlier and do not pull too much when doing so.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Aside from self-sealing fuel tanks which are common for jets after the 1950s, due to the need for ground attack and potential AA threats, the cockpit is surrounded by armour plates at 10-16 mm (albeit not up front); while the front fuselage tank is also protected by an armour plate at 10 mm by the belly.

Meanwhile, the JH-7A has 84 countermeasures installed; for most cases, these large calibre countermeasures can allow it to easily evade incoming missiles, but players will still have to plan ahead and manoeuvre to maximize the efficiency of CMs.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The JH-7A vastly upgrades the arsenal of the PLAAF/PLANAF with its great selection of bombs and self-defense IR AAMs, as well as its great manoeuvrability thanks to its aerodynamic design and powerful turbofan engines; while they have to be careful of its sheer size and low-altitude operations, most of the time both ground and aerial targets will have quite a bad day facing a well-piloted JH-7A.

==== Supersonic bomb truck ====
The JH-7A can be said as the one and only dedicated attacker of the PLANAF/PLAAF that fits the descriptor "bomb truck". The main target of the JH-7 series is surface warships while ground attacks are also part of its mission. Therefore, it has the highest payload of all Chinese jets (up to 22 x 250 kg unguided bombs) which makes base bombing an easy task with its speed and payload.

However, the JH-7 is also able to operate well in its dual role as a fighter, thanks to new composite materials, FBW, and its mostly well-designed aerodynamic features.

The statement of PLANAF and JASDF claimed that JH-7 could tail F-4EJ and even F-15J with ease.

While it is very likely to face more advanced fighters, namely the MiG-29 series and F-16 series which are the arch-enemy of the JH-7A as they can finish it off from longer ranges, but for those jets who are also at JH-7A's tier, unlike conventional attackers, it can actually tail enemy jets with relative ease even at such a huge size while having the acceleration to recover, as well as trading AoA for more chance to fire upon enemies.

Chances are enemy jets are unaware of JH-7A and having chaos with friendly aircrafts, if players happen to find a careless jet or during an one-on-one dogfight, the Flying Leopard will the the one that laugh at last; with both PL-5C and PL-8 as its IR AAM options, players can select which one to use accordingly - PL-5C for most occasions while PL-8 for long-range careless targets, both can finish off enemies with ease; while the researchable PL-5B is rear-aspect missile, thanks to its impressive thrust and range, careless targets can still be easy prey.

But to utilize the best of JH-7A, all the accidents involving JH-7A and some of its pilots hinted a flaw of high-wing aircrafts - its worse maneuverability at low speeds or altitude, it's always a good idea to check the altitude before engaging both ground and aerial targets, especially during dogfights, JH-7A needs more altitude to recover.

==== The taste of one's own medicine ====
At its tier, before JH-7A's introduction, players could only rely on F-16A MLU or Q-5L which both have some flaws of their own; F-16A only has less advanced AGMs while Q-5L has low payload and no countermeasures against enemy missiles.

Although JH-7A also lacks advanced AGMs (i.e. K/AKD88), it makes up with up to four LGBs of player's desire ranging from the well-known LS-500J and the new one-ton LS-1000J, as well as up to 22 unguided bombs to flatten a whole block of city; 90 mm or 130 mm rocket pods are still an option as well.

For Chinese tech-tree players, this will be the good time to let enemies with more advanced multirole jets to taste their own medicine - thanks to the advanced K/ADC03A targeting pod with high-definition and zoom, as well as 2nd gen TVD for target acquisition, it makes the life of JH-7A much easier when searching for ground targets; diving for the target then toss bombs is a way to go, but it's much safer to pull after dropping bombs then flying sideways while keeping the lock on target, 500 kg LGB will have no problem sending even the most-protected MBT to their kingdom come, let alone the 1t LGB which can even bring down multiple targets within a certain radius, especially SPAAs in a tight pack.

While going low and utilize the drag-chute retard bombs is still viable, be sure to know where the major forces of enemies are and avoid SPAAs, anti-air capable attack helicopters and other jets at all cost; the CCRP can help to destroy stationary targets (be sure to lock the area before dropping bombs).

As mentioned, although JH-7A lacks long-range AGMs for the safest approach, in case enemy players has little situational awareness or busy handling the advancing friendlies, the unguided rockets can still serve as extra firepower against enemy SPAAs or light vehicles; helping friendly jets/helicopters by taking out any possible threats is also a way to support the team well as they can now be ease on finishing off any exposed targets.

In case players used up all their bombs/rockets while having menacing enemy jets, JH-7A still has up to 4 IR AAMs to handle them; the tactics will be very similar to air battles while having to concern on enemy SPAAs, be sure to sneak up and deliver the fatal blow to enemies.

A note to JH-7A's operation is that: never, ever have any throughs on close call when evading terrains.

The high wing design needs much more altitude for recovery when doing ground assaults, it's better to quit the assault earlier than never since a surviving jet can do way more damage than a jet slapped itself onto the terrain.

After several years of development, China finalized the development of its own fighter-bomber, the JH-7, which ticked all of the boxes that were set out by PLA command for an aircraft to replace the outdated Q-5. In 1999, following orders from the Central Military Committee, work began on creating an improved version of the JH-7. This extensive modernization program included 303 changes, which included improving the fire control system with the introduction of a digital electronic sighting system, as well as increasing the range of its suspended weapons. This updated fighter-bomber, now designated JH-7A made its first flight in 2002, and began entering service in October 2004. JH-7A aircraft are still currently serving in the Chinese Air Force.
