== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The development program of the JH-7 "Flying Leopard" is a lesser-known but fascinating story in the realm of Chinese military aviation. Initially, the project was aimed at creating a capable twin-engine fighter-bomber during the late 20th century. The JH-7's early history was marked by significant challenges and delays, often due to resource constraints and a lack of access to advanced technology. However, Chinese engineers and aviation experts persisted, and the program eventually gave birth to the JH-7A in 2004, the initial variant of this aircraft. The JH-7A showcased China's determination to bolster its military capabilities, particularly in the realm of precision strike and maritime operations. While it might not have received the same global attention as other strike-fighter aircraft programs of its era, the JH-7 Flounder's journey reflects China's steady progress in the development of its indigenous military technology.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO reporting name: ''Flounder'') was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. Being a dedicated strike-fighter, the JH-7A specializes in the ground-strike role, and suffers in dedicated air-to-air combat at its battle rating, despite having access to the formidable [[PL-8]] and [[PL-5C]] all aspect missiles. As such, this aircraft can struggle in dedicated air modes, and instead shines the brightest in mixed battles thanks to its selection of precision ground ordnance and powerful targeting pod. The strong radar and all-aspect missiles can prove to be a strong form of self defence in mixed battles if the need arises. All in all, the JH-7A serves as a major upgrade in technology and capability over its predecessors in the tech tree, namely the Q-5 family.

=== Devblog History ===
After several years of development, China finalized the development of its own fighter-bomber, the JH-7, which ticked all of the boxes that were set out by PLA command for an aircraft to replace the outdated Q-5. In 1999, following orders from the Central Military Committee, work began on creating an improved version of the JH-7. This extensive modernization program included 303 changes, which included improving the fire control system with the introduction of a digital electronic sighting system, as well as increasing the range of its suspended weapons. This updated fighter-bomber, now designated JH-7A made its first flight in 2002, and began entering service in October 2004. JH-7A aircraft are still currently serving in the Chinese Air Force.
