== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
After the end of WWII, the British government outlined the threat of strategic jet bombers and their ability to deliver nuclear weapons. The threat reached a critical level during 1947, when the Soviet Union's first strategic jet bombers like the [[IL-28]] were nearing introduction to service. This caused the Air Ministry to issue Specification F.44/66, requiring a jet-powered, two-seat night fighter with radar capability. This aircraft was required to intercept enemy bombers at heights of up to 40,000 feet. It would also have to reach a maximum straight-line speed of 972 km/h at this height, and be able to perform rapid scrambles and ascents to attain the required altitude within ten minutes of engine ignition on the ground. Out of all the competing aircraft for this specification requirement, the renowned Gloster Aircraft Company, whom had already made a name for themselves shortly before by creating the Meteor, Britain's only operational jet fighter during WWII, would present the Gloster Javelin, a high-power interceptor that fulfilled the requirements. This design beat out the competition from de Havilland and was chosen by the Air Ministry in the early '50s to enter service under the FAW (Fighter, All Weather) designation class.

Introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]], the Javelin builds upon gameplay principles found in the earlier Meteor family, while also introducing new concepts that will become commonplace in British fighter-interceptor aircraft later down the line, such as the [[Lightning F.6]] and the [[Tornado F.3]], namely the high engine power at the sacrifice of manoeuvrability compared to adversaries. The Javelin, while not having the best flight performance, makes up for it in its firepower, wielding the strength of not only the powerful [[ADEN (30 mm)|ADEN 30 mm]] cannons, but also the [[Firestreak]] air-to-air missiles, and a strong radar system for its battle rating.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Javelin's key advantage is its dual afterburning engines which give it good acceleration and very good climb rate. It can (at lower altitudes) accelerate past 600 km/h in a 20° climb without issue. The Javelin also has a rather low top speed compared to other vehicles of the rank, when spaded it redlines at around 1,000 km/h and will rip soon after. It can and will rip its wings without going into a dive, so caution should be exercised when traveling in straight lines.

The Javelin also bleeds a tremendous amount of speed while turning, due to its massive wing area. This is somewhat offset by the powerful engines, which give the Javelin excellent acceleration and climb rate for the rank.

The Javelin does not compress heavily at higher speeds, but will rip if you try and turn tightly at high speed.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Javelin has no armour, and it is an extremely large aircraft. With the abundance of high calibre weapons at this rank, any hits will severely impact your ability to manoeuvre. Any damage to the wings or fuselage will severely hinder its ability to turn.

The engines and fuel tanks are scattered in the fuselage and the leading edges of the wings. Any shots taken there will either set you ablaze or knock out or damage an engine. Any shots to the tail are extremely likely to cut tail controls or remove the tail entirely.

If you lose a wing, the Javelin is able to fly and return to base with only one wing remaining.

Overall, the Javelin has extremely poor survivability. Any shot that you take, excluding American HMGs, have a significant likelihood of fatally damaging you, if not sending you straight back to the hangar.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

You are going to want to focus on getting flight performance modifications first to make the Javelin more bearable to fly. The stock belts and ADEN cannons are very good so these upgrades can be left until last, the stock roll rate is also good so new boosters are not a necessity and you may wish to go for the higher tier engine upgrades first. The Firestreaks come down to personal preference; if you like missile gameplay then they can be effective, but they are far from the best missiles available in game. If you have never played with air to air missiles before or can't stand the stock offensive capabilities then you may wish to unlock them, but do not expect to be shooting down fighters in the middle of a dogfight with them. Learning when/where to use them, and in what circumstances they are likely to hit will take time.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|ADEN (30 mm)|Firestreak}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 4 x 30 mm ADEN cannons, wing-mounted (200 rpg = 800 total)
* 4 x 30 mm ADEN cannons + 2 x Firestreak missiles
* 2 x 30 mm ADEN cannons + 4 x Firestreak missiles

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
As an aircraft the Javelin has many flaws and has picked up a fairly poor reputation, but once you get used to its quirks you can work around them and the Javelin can become an effective aircraft, which you can do well in. The Javelin's key advantage is its dual afterburning engines which give it good acceleration and very good climb rate; it can (at lower altitudes) accelerate past 600 km/h in a 20° climb without issue. As the Javelin has a fairly poor top speed (at least compared to some of the vehicles you can face), you will want to make use of the powerful engines and climb to a reasonable attitude quickly at the start of the match. In terms of climb profile your options are to either throw the Javelin in to a 10 - 20° climb straight off the runway, or build your speed (up to around 700 km/h), then enter the same sort of angle climb; the first option will get you to altitude in less distance, but you likely will not have much speed when you get there, on maps with room for it building speed first will give you more options. Your target altitude will vary depending on the situation, but typically you will want to be at at least 4,000 m, sometimes closer to 6,000 m on larger maps. Ultimately if an enemy fighter is above you in the Javelin and decides to dive on you, you're in for a bad time, you will likely not have the speed to out-run them in this scenario, and the Javelin's large size and somewhat lacking flight characteristics can make evasion tricky (and lead to you losing lots of energy); by climbing to a suitable altitude (depending on what the other team are doing) you can minimise the risk of this situation occurring.

Once at altitude you have two main options; you can either take up the role of bomber hunter, or set yourself up in a position to start diving down on enemy aircraft below you. The Javelin fits the role of bomber hunter fairly well, the search and tracking radars can be useful for finding bombers (although they suffer heavily from ground clutter) and the armament of four 30 mm cannons is more than capable of bringing down anything you face with one or two well aimed bursts. The Firestreak missiles also work well against bombers, which often do not have the manoeuvrability to evade them. A benefit of the radar, when coupled with missiles, is that if a target is locked then the locking cone for the missile will automatically follow the target, meaning you do not have to worry about pointing your plane straight at the target to get a missile lock. The Firestreaks can also be used against fighters, however they are not very manoeuvrable missiles so they can often be evaded by fighters fairly easily; they are best used a fairly short range, or if a target is flying in a straight line trying to outrun you.

The main drawbacks of the Javelin are the previously mentioned low top speed as well as it having terrible energy retention. The idea of turn fighting in the Javelin can be completely forgotten about in most circumstances; the turning circle is not great and attempting it will rapidly kill any speed / energy advantage you once had. Due to its poor energy retention, sudden movements in the Javelin should be avoided, where possible make large sweeping turns and gentle control inputs, in some situations even a brief hard rudder input can cost you a not insignificant chunk of speed.

Although the Javelin cannot generally out-run an enemy on pure speed alone there are cases where you can escape faster aircraft by exploiting the Javelin's excellent climb performance. While many aircraft have a higher top speed than the Javelin, not many can hold speed in a climb quite as well as a Javelin. This works best at low altitude and ideally needs to be done before the enemy can get within firing range. While travelling near your top speed open up the throttles to max and enter a climb; the Javelin will hold its top speed in a 10° climb all day, depending on what is chasing you this may be enough to stop them catching you, if not a 20° climb can be held for some time and even a 30° or more climb can be used for short periods of time if needed. This tactic will not work against all aircraft but many will bleed speed much quicker than the Javelin in a climb (particularly ones approaching 20 degrees) and often start falling behind you leading to the enemy player giving up and finding someone else to engage.

Another annoyance with the Javelin is the gun placement: quite far apart in the wings. The means that you have to take convergence into account and gives you less flexibility in terms of engagement range than nose-mounted guns, it also makes head on attacks a very risky proposition.

One more thing to be aware of with the Javelin (particularly at higher altitudes) is that once you reach your top speed you often do not need to use afterburner or even full throttle to maintain it in level flight. Depending on altitude you can maintain a speed near your top speed with 90% throttle or less, this can be useful for saving fuel or cooling the engines (not that the latter is necessary most of the time), if you don't want maxed out speed even a throttle setting as low as 75% can maintain a decent cruising speed.

==== Specific enemies worth noting ====

* [[MiG-15 (Family)|MiG-15 Family]]: able to catch you in a straight line, good climb, potent armament.
* [[F-86 (Family)|F-86 Family]]: able to catch you in a straight line, potent armament.
* [[G.91 (Family)|G.91 Family]]: able to catch you in a straight line, some with potent armament, good climb.

===Radars===
{{main|AN/APS-21|AN/APG-26}}
The Javelin F.(A.W.) Mk.9 is equipped with an [[AN/APS-21]] search radar, as well as an [[AN/APG-26]] target tracking radar. Both radars are located in the nose of the aircraft.

Gloster Javelin was the UK's first interceptor to use anti-air missiles<ref>[http://fguk.me/hangar/military-jets?start=20 <nowiki>[FGUK] Military Jets</nowiki>]</ref> and the first jet all-weather and night fighter specifically designed for that purpose.<ref>[http://www.airvectors.net/avjavlin.html <nowiki>[Air Vectors] The Gloster Javelin</nowiki>]</ref> It went through a very convoluted development history, with a number of versions introduced between 1954 and 1959,<ref name="thunderJavelin">[https://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/javelin/history.php <nowiki>[Thunder & Lightnings] Gloster Javelin - History</nowiki>]</ref> only to be replaced by the [[Lightning F.6|Electric Lightning]] from 1961 onwards.<ref>[[Wikipedia:English_Electric_Lightning#Variants|[Wikipedia] English Electric Lightning - Variants]]</ref><ref name="wikiJavelin">[[Wikipedia:Gloster_Javelin|[Wikipedia] Gloster Javelin]]</ref> To this day it's the western fighter with the largest wing area, featuring a massive 86.1 m² wing (comparing to 44.08 m² of the Lightning, 52.8 m² of the [[Ho 229 V3]] or 43 m² of the F-35).

Gloster Javelin FAW Mk 9 was a conversion of the FAW 7, with airplanes delivered between December 1959 and December 1961. The primary goal of the modernization effort was to improve the flight characteristics, most notably through the upgrade to the powerplant. Changes included:<ref name="thunderJavelin" /><ref name="wikiJavelin" />

* Engines with added afterburner for a maximum thrust of 12,300 lbf (11,000 lb without afterburner)
* Modified wings and extended jet pipes
* Increased maximum take-off weight (43,165 kg from 40,270 of the predecessor)
* Lower maximum speed (610 knots at Sea Level vs 616 in FAW 7, Mach 0.93 vs 0.95)

In total 116 fighters were converted to the FAW 9 version, 44 of which were further modified into the flight refueling version (FAW 9F/R) which features an added refueling probe and other related subsystems.

The first fighter squadron to receive deliveries of the Gloster Javelin in 1956 was the RAF Squadron No. 46 based in Hampshire, south England. The last one was the No. 60 Squadron, which was disbanded in 1968, where the FAW 9 and 9R fighters served at the Tengah Air Base in Singapore.
