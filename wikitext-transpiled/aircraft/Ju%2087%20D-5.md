== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German dive bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The last in the in-game series of dive-bombing Ju 87 aircraft, the {{PAGENAME}} shows the transition between the Ju 87's original dive-bombing role to [[Ju 87 G-1|cannon ground-attack]]. With its wing guns switched out to 20 mm cannon armaments, as well as a diverse suspended armament options, the {{PAGENAME}} can allow players to choose different ways to attack ground targets when in a match.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Ju 87 D-5 is not as fast as most, if not all the fighters at its battle rating, but it is surprisingly manoeuvrable at low speeds compared to them.

Since this plane typically gets an air start in RB at around 3,500 m, gaining altitude is generally not a major problem at the beginning of matches on this plane. Be careful though, as if the D-5 reaches speed of anything above 450 km/h, it will start to get extreme lock-ups in the horizontal axis and slightly less in the vertical. However, staying around the 300 km/h can have the D-5 be able to out-manoeuvre opponents.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

The stock 20 mm cannons are not very effective with the aircraft's role or aerodynamics.

Players who often play earlier Ju 87's probably did their best to not engage enemies, as they were only equipped with two 7.92 mm machine guns to fight alongside the rear gunner's machine guns. However, with this Ju 87 comes new and improved armament of 20 mm cannons. As a result, this opens up a whole new world as a fighter.

If battling fighters, try to head on them as the Ju 87 is a relatively tough plane, and with the gun pods attached any pilot foolish enough to head on you will most likely end up as mincemeat. If they don't do so, try to bleed their energy and speed, and then swoop in for the kill.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

The suspended 12 x 7.92 mm deals with enemy aircraft pretty well, though runs out of ammo quickly. It is most suited for beginners since the tracers are more visible. The suspended 4 x 20 mm cannons are good at downing bombers and fighters but they impact negatively the flight performance of the D-5 considerably more than the 12 x 7.92 mm gunpods.

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 81 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 2 x 7.92 mm MG 81 machine guns, dorsal turret (700 rpg = 1,400 total)

The turret 7.92 mm machine gun is somewhat useful in distracting enemies but does not deal a lot of damage.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Ju 87 series are mainly adapted for ground attack roles. The D-5 variant has two 20 mm MG 151 cannons which are suitable for attacking light-medium tanks. In addition in the research tree, you can get additional WB 151 (4 x MG 151 cannons) or the WB 81B (12 x MG 81 machine guns) gun pods.

The Ju 87 D-5 is excellent for ground strikes. It can be equipped with bombs, incendiary bombs (although these are only useful against targets with exposed crews like certain SPAAs or vehicles like the [[YaG-10 (29-K)]]), 7.92 mm machine guns and 20 mm cannons. The 20 mm is recommended because the 7.92 mm runs out of ammo fairly fast.

The best use of the Ju 87 D-5 in air battles is bomber hunting. It spawns at the bomber altitude of 3,000-3,500 m (10,000-12,000 ft). One burst of the 20 mm cannons, especially with the suspended armaments and while using the air targets belt, is enough to destroy a bomber and even fighters.

If you decide to play the role of a fighter instead of the historic role of the attacker, it is recommended that you climb to around 5,500 m, which you should easily be able to do before reaching your enemies at the halfway point. As noted in the flight performance, staying at speeds greater than 400 km/h can lock up the control surfaces, meaning dogfighting at high speed is not in the plane's favour. Get the enemy to bleed speed to the more favourable 300 km/h-range, at which you will be able to outturn them.

Stock ammo belts are pretty bad, so try to get air target belts ASAP. Armoured target ammo is not able to take out medium tanks (unlike air target ammo, which can take out medium tanks on some select maps), and it is less effective against aircraft.

With the additional 20 mm cannons in the suspended armaments, the Ju 87 D-5 becomes a worthy opponent in head-ons. With this loadout, one should make sure not to be caught at less than 350 km/h. At speeds higher than this, the D-5 can still manage to do a quick turn around to lay the guns on a target from nearly every angle. The gun pods damage the roll rate quite significantly, so heavy use of the rudder is recommended. Pilots more experienced with aiming MG 151s might benefit from using stealth belts, as they make enemies less likely to take evasive action, consequently saving precious speed as you no longer have to manoeuvre to stay on target.

Because of their low speed, non-retractable landing gear and reasonable durability, all the Ju 87 series are quite good for capturing airfields in the Airfield Domination mode.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

[[Yak-2 KABB]] - Do not think that the {{PAGENAME}} can confidently outmanoeuvre this plane just because it is twin-engined. The Yak-2 has an amazing turn rate for a heavy fighter, thus the {{PAGENAME}} must avoid turning with it, if not dogfighting with it in general. It bears a pair of ShVAK cannons that can easily damage vital parts like engine or cooling systems. It has green camouflage, greatly resembling an Me 410 but with an H-tail like a Bf 110's.

[[ZSD63]] - A dangerous SPAA to go up against in Tank Realistic Battles. Though it is hard to identify specific SPAA vehicles on the ground (especially when they are shooting tracers at the plane), if a ZSD63 is identified, avoid it at all costs and '''do not''' attempt head-ons with it, ever. It can easily snap a wing off by casually putting a short burst in the {{PAGENAME}}'s flight path. Don't even get close to it unless it is busy shooting someone else or if the {{PAGENAME}} has a bomb ready for use. The numerous MGs / cannons on the {{PAGENAME}} cannot effectively damage it as its hull is overall quite empty, causing your shells to do little to no damage. Some identifying features of the ZSD63 is its rather boxy and tall hull with a geometric turret sitting at the back, slightly similar to a Wirbelwind's. The firing manner is also distinctive: the sound and green tracers are very rapid, much like a buzz saw, but then it will remain silent for half a minute reloading. Note that an experienced ZSD player will hold its fire or shoot in single salvoes with long halts between, making it look like that it's reloading.

'''Pros:'''

* Has two MG 151 20 mm cannons which are decent for taking out aircraft after unlocking air target belts;
* Large ammo reserve for its armament, equating to 1,000 rounds between each MG 151/20 cannon;
* Can equip either 20 mm WB 151 or 7.92 mm WB 81B gun pods below the wing, increasing armament size by four 20 mm MG 151/20 or twelve 7.92 mm MG 81 for frontal firepower;
* Tail gun has one of the best rates of fire in-game and covers a generous portion of the aircraft's rear
* Decent bomb loads;
* Great manoeuvrability at lower speeds, can turn on a dime at a high speed;
* Pilot and gunner are protected with all-around armour;
* Very efficient radiator;
* Tolerant flaps;
* Air start in most RB maps.

'''Cons:'''

* Low roll rate when not using the rudder;
* Slow, has a poor climb rate and loses energy quite easily, especially in turns;
* Overheats easily with WEP, use of WEP is not advised until in combat;
* High Parasite drag, imposed by the wheel spats;
* Control stiffening (lock-up) is severe at moderate to high speeds (hence why you should use the air brakes during dives);
* Very Low Wing-Lift Co-efficient making the aircraft highly susceptible to stalling;
* Radiator is damaged easily by enemy fire;
* Poor rate of climb.

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
In early 1943, a new variant of the Stuka, the Ju 87D-5, was launched into full-scale production. The D-5 variant was originally conceived of as a ground-attack aircraft, as opposed to the previous D-3 version, for which ground attacks were thought to be only one of its possible combat uses.

From the start, no speed brakes were mounted under the D-5's wings, and as full-scale production continued, the fittings to fix the brakes to the drive gear were also eliminated. The aircraft's wings were redesigned, with the wingspan significantly increased. The enlarged area significantly reduced the load on the aircraft's wings and improved the Stuka's takeoff and landing characteristics.

The aircraft's armament was reinforced: the wing-mounted 7.92 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 17 machine guns were swapped out for two 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons with 500 rounds each.

The 1000/500/IXb bomb rack was used to suspend aerial bombs weighing 1,000 kg or more under the fuselage, and the 500/IXc rack was used for bombs weighing 500 kg or less. Underwing ETC 50/VIIIdTp bomb racks allowed bombs and containers weighing up to 300 kg to be suspended from the middle pylon; bombs and other loads weighing up to 70 kg could be hung from the two side pylons.

When acting as a ground-attack aircraft, Stukas most often had wooden containers for ninety-two 2 kg fragmentation SC 2 aerial bombs; however, these had little effect against protected targets. Aerial bombs of a larger size, 250 and 500 kg, were used to attack such targets.

The engine's exhaust pipes were not covered with fairings, and die-stamped, corrugated steel strips for the crew were riveted to the centre wing section instead of rubber "tracks". The fork of the fuselage-mounted bomb rack was reinforced.

A system to jettison the main landing gear struts was introduced on the D-5 to enable an emergency landing on uneven terrain.

As the full-scale production of the D-5 variant continued, a number of changes were introduced to the structure to improve visibility from the cockpit, increase the crew's safety, and make the aircraft easier to pilot at low altitudes. The following were added to the covering of the cockpit canopy: an additional strut in the structure of the side glass panels, an additional direct-vision window in the sliding section of the canopy, and a convex blister over the armoured windscreen panel, for mounting the Revi C/12D gunsight.

The Ju 87 D-5 was the last variant of the Stuka whose full-scale production was significant. This variant was manufactured until the Stuka's production was discontinued in the late summer of 1944. A total of 1,190 aircraft were produced. A simplified variant of the D-5, named the D-6, was developed but never entered full-scale production.
