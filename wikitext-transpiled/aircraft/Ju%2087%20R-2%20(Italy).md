== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

The Italian version of the [[Ju 87 R-2]] is quite similar to the German version, with some minor differences in terms of speed and flight performance. Additionally, the Italian version has different payload options as it carries different types of bombs. So it cannot carry the 1,000 kg bomb but it can carry some 50 kg bombs underneath the wings. It has 2 x 7.92 mm offensive machine guns and a single 7.92 mm machine gun in a dorsal turret operated by the gunner. Although this seems unimpressive, this armament is on par with most fighters at its rank and the rear MG, even with its blind spots, its decent enough to shake off some fighters.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Ju 87 R-2 isn't very manoeuvrable with bombs attached, but it can dance with a fighter in an emergency if it has the energy and has dropped the bombs.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 8 mm steel behind pilot
- 5 mm steel between pilot and gunner

This bomber has better durability than most fighters of its rank, but subpar compared to similar bombers. The engine can be quite weak to oil and water leaks, so be sure to return to the base as soon as possible if your oil or water systems are hit.

{{main|MG 17 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

{{main|GP 50 (50 kg)|GP 250 (250 kg)|GP 500 (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 1 x 250 kg GP 250 bomb (250 kg total)
- 1 x 250 kg GP 250 bomb + 4 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (450 kg total)
- 1 x 500 kg GP 500 bomb (500 kg total)
- 1 x 500 kg GP 500 bomb + 4 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (700 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, dorsal turret (900 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Dive-bomber'''

The main use of this aircraft is to attack ground targets. "soft" targets such AA emplacements, howitzers, artillery, trucks, and light armoured cars can be destroyed with the forward-firing 7.92 mm MGs, and you can destroy heavier ground targets with bombs such as pillboxes, and AI or player controlled tanks. It can carry a max of 1 x 500 kg bombs + 4 x 50 kg in 3 drops, two of the 50 kg bombs (that drop in pairs) and a single 500 kg drop. The two drops of the 50 kg bombs drop without delay, but the 500 kg bomb sits on a pair of arms that take the bomb outwards and then drops. This means that there is a little delay between the trigger and the bomb release, so keep in mind that you have to drop the bomb a bit earlier and keep going in the same trajectory.

'''Fighter'''

The Ju-87 R-2 can be a decently manoeuvrable once the bombs have been dropped, and as it usually faces biplanes, the armament of two low-calibre guns is not really underwhelming. As soon as the match starts drop the bombs and climb at 220 km/h, because of the air-spawn you will be higher than most fighters, and then you can boom and zoom them. This tactic benefits greatly from flying with a squad.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- More diverse payload options than its German counterpart
- The rear MG can be useful
- Decently manoeuvrable without any bombs
- Decent amount of ammo for the MGs
- Good visibility on cockpit view for simulator

'''Cons:'''

- Maximum payload is less than the German [[Ju 87 R-2]]
- Main bomb release mechanism takes time to release
- Although manoeuvrable, not enough to outmanoeuvre most fighters

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
