== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

It is identical to the standard [[Ju 87 R-2]] except for its unique desert camo with a snake motif.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
* 8 mm Steel plate inside of pilot's seat
* 5 mm Steel plate between gunner and pilot

There is no protection on the engine or cooling systems. Since it is a dive bomber, the plane is especially vulnerable to flak and even small calibre AA fire. Due to the increased amount of drag on the plane at lower altitudes, it is best to make sure you do not dive too close to the ground when dive-bombing because if penetrated, your engine will overheat and die quickly from overheating before being able to return to base for repairs. The fuel tanks are located in the wings in close proximity to the fuselage, which makes them vulnerable to any explosive shrapnel from dropped bombs when flying level or pulling out of a dive.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 17 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

The different choices of ammunition types are as follows:

* '''Default''': AP-T{{-}}Ball{{-}}Ball{{-}}AP-I{{-}}AI
* '''Tracers''': AP-T
* '''Universal''': AP-T{{-}}AP{{-}}AI{{-}}AP-I
* '''Stealth''': AI{{-}}AP

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|SC250JA (250 kg)|SC500K (500 kg)|SC1000L2 (1,000 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 1 x 250 kg SC250JA bomb (250 kg total)
* 1 x 500 kg SC500K bomb (500 kg total)
* 1 x 1,000 kg SC1000L2 bomb (1,000 kg total)

The 1,000 kg bomb is highly effective at this BR, especially in Simulator battles. Make sure to set a long enough fuse for bombing to reduce the chance of fuel leaks. The 1,000 kg bomb may destroy a base in one hit at its BR.

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, dorsal turret (900 rpg)

The different choices of ammunition are as follows:

* '''Default''': AP-T{{-}}Ball{{-}}Ball{{-}}AP-I{{-}}AI
* '''Armored targets''': AP{{-}}AP-T
* '''AP-T''': AP-I{{-}}AP-T

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Turret with high fire rate
* Airbrakes that make dives and landing easier
* High maximum dive speed for its tier
* Becomes much easier to manoeuvre and retain speed above 1,000 m

'''Cons:'''

* Slow speeds and poor maneuverability at low altitudes
* Poor climb rate
* Poor energy retention at low altitudes
* Poor radiator performance in hot maps, cannot use WEP for long.
* Can carry only one bomb at a time
* Unprotected engine and pilot, vulnerable to head-on encounters

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Ju 87 R-2 Libya belonged to St.G 2 and was used off the Libyan coast in Timimi to attack Allied ships in the Mediterranean. It was flown by Lieutenant Hubert Pölz of 6./St.G 2 and participated in the sinking of HMS Auckland off Tobruk in June 1941. The markings designate the plane as the fourth plane in the sixth Staffel of the second ''Gruppe'' in Sturzkampfgeschwader 2.
