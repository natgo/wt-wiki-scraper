== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 "Royal Armour"]].

* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, dorsal turret (600 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ju-88 A is a fast bomber with a rather light bomb load.

In any air AB/RB match, attack enemy AI units as your bombs barely have enough potency to destroy a base. Maintain your speed to evade pursuing fighters. In ground RB matches, it is recommended to carry the 2 x SC500K bombs as they can help you destroy reliably ground targets. With only a rifle-calibre MG as offensive armament, head-ons are ill-advised.

If you are under attack, force the enemy to tailgate you as that is your only chance of returning back to base. Dive down and have your gunners open fire on the enemy. There are 2 gunners that cover the rear of the plane, creating a blank spot for fighters attacking perpendicularly to the flight direction.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Equipped with air brakes, able to dive bomb
* Airframe can withstand high speeds during a dive
* Can outrun lower-end fighters
* Has an offensive forward-firing machine gun
* Carries a decent max load of 1,900 kg compared to contemporaries
* Lots of suspended armament options
* Carrying the maximum payload doesn't have that much penalty in overall performance
* Very accurate in precision bombing
* The 50 kg bombs are very efficient in taking out soft ground targets (AA emplacement, MG nest, artillery position)

'''Cons:'''

* Defensive armament is poor and has a massive dead zone
* Stock bomb load is inadequate

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

[[File:Ju 88 A-1 1940.jpg|thumb|400x400px|A Junkers 88 A-1, of Kampfgeschwader 51 with its crew (1940)]]
The Junkers Ju 88 A-1 was the first variant of the famous Junkers Ju 88 bomber. After the failure of the [[B3C|Junkers Ju 86]], the Junkers team was tasked to make a new bomber able to go faster than the [[Do 17 (Family)|Dornier Do 17]] and [[He 111 (Family)|Heinkel He 111]], and even fighters: a true "schnell bomber" (fast bomber)! The prototypes succeeded in their design requirement, being faster than any fighter then in service, but once all the military equipment was added, it was not much faster than what it was designed to replace. Regardless, it had great promise and with more changes proved to be a capable and adaptable warplane. Combat results with the short wing A-1 were below expectations, only 133 units being built before major upgrades were introduced with the A-4. All surviving A-1s were upgraded to the A-5 long wing standard. Amazingly, an Ju 88 A-1 exists today, being found in a freshwater lake in very good condition, and fully restored.

=== Design and development ===
The Ju 88 originated from a 1935 requirement for a new high-speed dive bomber with a crew of 3, capable of reaching 480 km/h.<ref name=":0">V, R. (2019)</ref> The Henschel and Messerschmitt design firms also submitted designs, but later withdrew them; thus, Junkers won the competition and proceeded to produce prototypes. The first Ju 88 prototype flew in December of 1936, and managed to reach a speed of 520 km/h;<ref name=":0" /> Later on, a pre-production Ju 88 set a record for a 1,000 km circuit, averaging 517 km/h. After the completion of ten prototypes of the Ju 88 A-0 series, the Ju 88 A-1 was ordered into production with deliveries starting in 1939.<ref name=":0" />

The Ju 88 is a conventional twin-engined light bomber, with the engines mounted in nacelles on each wing. The aircraft has a crew of three, being a pilot, bombardier and radio operator/rear gunner. The aircraft's armament was sparse, consisting of just three 7.92 mm machine guns; this was steadily improved in later Ju 88 variants. The A-1 could carry a maximum bomb load of 1,000 kilograms in standard load, though heavier loads could be carried with modifications.<ref name=":0" />

=== Operational history ===
The Ju 88 A-1 started entering service with the Luftwaffe in 1939; 69 aircraft were built that year.<ref name=":1">Rickard, J. (2007)</ref> The aircraft saw its first combat attacking British shipping in the fall of 1939.<ref name=":1" /> The aircraft served extensively in the Battle of Britain as the main Luftwaffe bomber, and fulfilled the same role in Operation Barbarossa, the attempted German invasion of the USSR. By that point in time, it was complemented by more advanced variants of the Ju 88 such as the Ju 88 A-4.

During its time in service, it became highly apparent that the Ju 88 A-1 was not well suited to its task. Namely, the aircraft wasn't adequately armed, with just three defensive machine guns.<ref name=":1" /> Thus, the later Ju 88 A-4 variant introduced a heavier defensive armament of five 7.92 mm machine guns; later derivatives such as the Ju 188 featured even more defensive armament.<ref name=":1" /> As well, the aircraft experienced structural strength issues, which prevented it from entering fast dives without breaking up. This was also remedied by the later Ju 88 A-4.<ref name=":1" /> Despite its flaws, the Ju 88 was a versatile, reliable aircraft and over 15,000 aircraft were built before the end of the war.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
