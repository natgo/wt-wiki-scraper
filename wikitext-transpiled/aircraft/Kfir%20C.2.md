== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Based on the [[Nesher]], the Kfir (translates to "Lion Cub") was an Israeli program to improve their existing Mirage fleet with new avionics and the General Electric J79 engine from the [[F-4E_Phantom_II_(Israel)|F-4 Phantom II]]. Compared to the original French SNECMA Atar 9C engine in the Nesher, the J79 engine was shorter and had higher requirements for air flow and operating temperatures, so the modified aircrafts holding the J79 had their rear ends redesigned for the shorter engine, with air intakes added or enlarged to accommodate the engine temperatures. The first prototype, under the name Ra'am (for "Thunder") flew on June 4, 1973, and the prototype would be accepted into Israeli Air Force service on April 14, 1975, in the 101 "First Fighter" Squadron as the Kfir C.1. The Kfir C.2 variant was the second production model after complaints that the C.1 had inferior maneuverability compared to the [[Mirage IIICJ]], which saw the addition of canard (larger than that found on the [[Kfir Canard]]), leading edges on the wing, and small strakes on the nose.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced into the game in [[Update "Wind of Change"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7640-event-the-battle-for-arachis-en|"Battle for Arachis"]] event, shares its characteristics with the Mirage 5 lineage as a fighter-bomber, capable of performing in an air-to-air or air-to-ground role with its avionics and flight performance. Air-to-air performance is benefitted by the {{Specs|name}}'s maneuverability, especially its turn rates, to get nose onto target for guns or missiles, though missile availability is hindered to just two IR seeking missiles. For air-to-ground, the {{Specs|name}}'s ability to carry a total of eight 1000 lb bombs allows it to be able to destroy a base in air realistic mode or several armoured ground targets in ground battles. A full suite of [[Ballistic_Computer|ballistic computers allow for CCIP and CCRP]] usage that allows Kfir pilots to get their payload onto target as accurately as possible. The versatility in the Kfir's roles ensures that players are able to use it in response to different combat situations over the course of a match.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
===[[wt:en/news/7637-development-battle-for-arachis-kfir-c-2-en|Devblog]]===
Operationally, the Kfir fighters from the first production series revealed a number of flaws in their design, in particular, an increased mass compared to the Mirage, as well as a forward shift in balance due to the greater weight of the suspended weaponry that affected the controllability and turn rate. To eliminate these concerns, the engineers proposed equipping the fighter with canards in the air intake areas, as well as installing aerodynamic ridges to redirect the airstream from the nose and provide a vortex around the canards. A dogtooth appeared on the leading edge of the wing that was intended to increase the lateral stability of the aircraft at high angles of attack. As a result, maneuverability at low speeds increased, and takeoff and landing runs became shorter. In addition, the new Kfir modification also received two additional weapon suspension hardpoints. The modification of the fighter with canards entered service with the Israeli Air Force in 1977 under the designation Kfir C.2, in addition to new machines, most Kfirs from the first production series were upgraded to the C.2 level. Aside from Israel, Kfir C.2 was in service with the armies of Colombia, Ecuador and Sri Lanka.
