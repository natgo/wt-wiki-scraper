== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', designated as '''Type 95 Fighter ({{Annotation|九五式戦闘機|Kyū Go-shiki Sentōki}})''', was a biplane fighter aircraft developed by Kawasaki for the Imperial Japanese Army in the mid-1930s. It was designed by Takeo Doi, who had succeeded the German Richard Vogt as chief designer for Kawasaki. The Ki-10 was the winner of the contract against Nakajima's Ki-11, a low-wing monoplane, as the Army preferred the more manoeuvrable biplane. The Ki-10 had a metal structure covered with fabric, a liquid-cooled V-12 engine, and two 7.7 mm machine guns. The Ki-10 entered service in 1937 and saw combat in Manchukuo, North China, and Southeast Asia during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the early stages of World War II. It was the last biplane fighter used by the Japanese Army, and was gradually replaced by more advanced monoplane fighters such as the Ki-27, Ki-43, and Ki-44.

In the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27, the Ki-10-I has a good turn rate, fair climb, low speed, and minimal armour. It is faster and climbs better than other biplanes, but has weaker guns and protection. The Ki-10-I can turn-fight well at low altitudes, but should avoid stalls and spins. Its 7.7 mm guns have low fire rate and poor belts. Stealth belt is the best choice. The Ki-10-I should not attack armoured targets or bombers, but focus on other biplanes or slow monoplanes. Aim for the wings, not the fuselage. Teamwork is essential for the Ki-10-I.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* No armour plating
* No armour glazing
* All critical components located in front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)

Like many biplanes before and contemporaries of the {{PAGENAME}}, armour was not an option, survival was based on the pilot's grit. Armour added weight, weight the early biplanes could not afford to carry and still be a viable fighter. Flying in open cockpit and fabric-covered aircraft, the only protection the pilot had was to place his engine between him and his enemy, otherwise, the pilot was vulnerable. Typically aircraft like this have the engine at the nose of the aircraft, followed by the fuel tank and then the cockpit, all three critical components relatively crammed together. The pilot's toolbox had to contain situational awareness as he needed to know where the enemy was around him. Tracer rounds could easily ignite the fabric-covered aircraft or large fuel tanks, so it was imperative the pilot was the attacker, not the one being attacked and knowing where the enemies are at can help avoid getting shot at.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

For such low tier vehicles the order of research does not really matter. Improvements in firepower by new belts and new machine guns help a lot in arcade battles. For realistic mode, performance upgrades are more often necessary.

{{main|Type 89 (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.7 mm Type 89 machine guns, nose-mounted (450 rpg = 900 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ki-10-I's low speed and tight turning ability make it a great turn-fighter, like most Japanese light fighters. The Ki-10-I excels at low and slow turn fighting at very low altitudes where enemies cannot out-dive it. Additionally, it has a climb rate to climb away from enemy biplanes. Very fast dives should be avoided, as the wings will shear off at very high speeds. Similarly, turning stalls should be avoided, as the Ki-10-I has a tendency to enter uncontrollable spins.

Its twin 7.7 mm armament is the weakest in the game, as it has a lower fire rate than its contemporaries, the [[ShKAS (7.62 mm)|ShKAS]], [[Browning (7.62 mm)|Browning]], and [[MG 17 (7.92 mm)|MG 17]]. The belts are poor as well; Stealth is most recommended, as it has the most AP-derivative shells. Strafing attacks on all but the least armoured targets are not recommended; Artillery, Vehicles, and Landing Craft are good and soft targets, while the Ki-10-I's weak construction makes attacking AAA and bombers risky. All bombers are pretty much invulnerable to the Ki-10-I (Beaufort, A-26, etc.) unless you are extremely good at making consistent pilot shots. Cargo Ships, Tanks and pillboxes are also invulnerable to the Ki-10-II. Instead, the best Ki-10-I targets are other biplanes or slow monoplanes, such as [[P-26 (Family)|P-26s]], [[Fury Mk I|Fury Mk Is]] or [[Nimrod Mk I|Nimrod Mk Is]]. The best practice is to aim for the wings! The fuselage's of all planes will absorb your shells like a sponge. Like most other planes, the Ki-10-I works best in numbers. Ki-10 pilots should focus primarily on sticking together and working as a team.

The Kawasaki Ki-10 was the last Biplane fighter used by the Japanese Army. Introduced in 1935, it beat the competing Nakajima Ki-11 (which would later be refined as the [[Ki-27 otsu|Ki-27]]) as the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force placed more priority on manoeuvrability than speed. Its excellent manoeuvrability made it extremely popular with Japanese pilots, who demanded similar high manoeuvrability from newer aircraft. Over the course of its service, the fighter would be refined several times with the ultimate version, the [[Ki-10-II]], appearing in 1937.

The Ki-10 saw service against Chinese air forces in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War and against Soviet air forces during the battles of Khalkhin Gol (where it historically outperformed the Soviet [[I-15 M-22|I-15]]). It formed the backbone of the IJAAS fighter forces until 1940, but it was considered obsolete by Western military experts as early as 1938. By the start of the Pacific War, the Ki-10 had been relegated to training and courier roles, and received the Allied reporting name "Perry".

There are no known incidents where the Ki-10 engaged American- or British-crewed aircraft, though the Japanese fighter did fight Chinese National [[P-26A-33|P-26s]], and may have engaged British-built [[Gladiator Mk II|Gladiators]], Italian [[CR.32]]s, and Soviet [[I-15bis|I-15s]], all crewed by Chinese pilots, during the early battles of the war.

Kawasaki Ki-10-I (Type 95-I, Allied reporting name: Perry) single-engine army fighter

A biplane of composite structure with non-retractable landing gear and an open cockpit. This plane was created in the design bureau of Kawasaki Heavy Industries under the direction of Takeo Doi. While the new fighter was being designed, experience and structural solutions were used from the Ki-5 monoplane fighter developed earlier.

The designers, headed by Takeo Doi, managed to create quite a successful aircraft with good flight performance. The Type 95 fighter got off the ground for the first time in February 1935, and it reached a maximum speed of 400 km/h during tests. At the time, this was probably the fastest speed attainable by a biplane.

The aircraft was launched into full-scale production under the designation of "Army Fighter Type 95 Model 1" (Ki-10-I). A total of 300 fighters of this variant were supplied by the Kawasaki company from December 1935 to October 1937.

The aircraft was equipped with a 850 hp Kawasaki Ha-9-IIa twelve-cylinder, double-row, liquid-cooled engine that featured a gear-driven centrifugal-type supercharger and a three-bladed, controllable-pitch metal propeller. The engine itself was a licensed version of the German BMW9.

The Ki-10's fuselage was a semi-monocoque with stressed duralumin skin panels overlapping each other. This technology made assembly easier, but the joints had to be puttied and covered with a thick layer of paint and lacquer to reduce friction resistance. As a result, the external finish was so thick that one could not see any of the duralumin sheets' joints, even when standing quite close.

All of these machines were produced with drop-shaped wheel fairings, but these were usually removed when the plane was operated on temporary airfields.

The plane's armament consisted of two synchronous 7.7 mm Type 89 (Vickers system, heavily upgraded) machine guns with 450 rounds each. These guns were mounted over the engine. The trigger button was placed in a very original location, not on the aircraft control stick but on the throttle.

The aircraft's instrumentation and on-board navigation lights enabled the Ki-10 to perform night flights. Provision was made for the installation of an oxygen apparatus. Command vehicles were equipped with radio sets. Externally, these fighters could be identified by the radio antennas mounted over their biplane cellules.
