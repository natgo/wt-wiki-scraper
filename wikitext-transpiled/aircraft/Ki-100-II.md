== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 13 mm steel plate behind the pilot seat and headrest

{{main|Ho-5 (20 mm)|Ho-103 (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 20 mm Ho-5 cannons, nose-mounted (200 rpg = 400 total)
- 2 x 12.7 mm Ho-103 machine guns, wing-mounted (250 rpg = 500 total)

{{main|Army Type 94 GPHE (50 kg)|Army Type 94 GPHE (100 kg)|Army Type 92 GPHE (250 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 2 x 50 kg Army Type 94 GPHE bombs (100 kg total)
- 2 x 100 kg Army Type 94 GPHE bombs (200 kg total)
- 2 x 250 kg Army Type 92 GPHE bombs (500 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Pilots of the standard Ki-100 found in the tech tree should feel relatively comfortable in the premium Ki-100-II. This aircraft offers balanced performance characteristics that allow the pilot to choose how he wishes to fight in the Ki-100-II and adapt to the combat situation as necessary. The performance of the Ki-100-II is characterized by decent climb rate and manoeuvrability. The aircraft has good (but not the best) acceleration in a dive that makes it suitable for short range "boom and zoom" style attacks. The pilot should position the fighter around 1000 meters above a selected target, dive rapidly, fire a quick burst, and then pull away in a shallow climb to hold the plane's speed and escape. This is the safest way to conduct combat in the Ki-100-II, but there are other options available.

Against less manoeuvrable opponents, turn fighting can be a valid approach. Most German and American aircraft will not be able to out-turn you. However, turning combat is only advised when there are no other enemies around that could pounce on you while you are focused on your target. Do not manoeuvre for too long and avoid getting too slow, because your control surfaces will become less responsive. Then you will be a sitting duck for most other fighters.

With sufficient speed, the Ki-100-II also has suitable energy retention characteristics for spiral climbs and other moves that can drain your opponent's energy. However, there are other fighters which are still superior in this regard.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Nose-mounted Ho-5 cannons gives you better chance in head-ons
- Flexible fighting style
- Good climb rate and decent turn time
- Doesn't lock up too badly at high speed
- Turbocharger improves high altitude performance

'''Cons:'''

- No considerable strengths in performance

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Ki-100 was an fighter/interceptor which was developed from the Ki-61-II and the result of Japan's need to stop American bombing raids over the mainland. In October of 1944, the decision was made to fit 3 Ki-61s with Ha-112 radial engines, which were lighter and more reliable then the Ha-140 inline engine that the Ki-61 used. On February 1, 1945, the modified Ki-61 made its first flight, where it performed well. Continued testing throughout March and April proved that it outperformed the Ki-84, then considered the best fighter in the IJAAF's operation. In March 1945, because of its favourable performance, coupled with its much more reliable engine, it was ordered into production and given the Ki-100 designation. It began combat service on March 9, and was used mainly for its intended purpose until the Japanese surrender in 1945. A total of 396 were built.

The Ki-100-II was a prototype version of the Ki-100, built to improve its high altitude performance in order to improve interception capabilities against high flying American B-29s. It replaced the Ki-100's regular engine with a turbocharged, water-methanol injected one that enhanced performance above 8 kilometres. Ultimately, only 3 were built, with none of them ever seeing combat.
