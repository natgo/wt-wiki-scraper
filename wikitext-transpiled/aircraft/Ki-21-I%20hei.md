== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]] as a reward vehicle for the [[wt:en/news/4416-special-war-thunder-winter-holiday-en|2016 "Winter Holiday"]] event. It was later made available as a battle trophy vehicle in the Warbond shop from the [[Battle Pass: Season I, 75th Anniversary of the Great Victory]] until the end of the [[Battle Pass: Season IV, "Fearless Voltigeur"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- No armour
- Self-sealing fuel tanks (2 in each wing, 2 in the mid-fuselage)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Army Type 94 GPHE (50 kg)|Army Type 94 GPHE (100 kg)|Army Type 92 GPHE (250 kg)|Army Type 92 GPHE (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 20 x 50 kg Army Type 94 GPHE bombs (1,000 kg total)
- 10 x 100 kg Army Type 94 GPHE bombs (1,000 kg total)
- 4 x 250 kg Army Type 92 GPHE bombs (1,000 kg total)
- 2 x 500 kg Army Type 92 GPHE bombs (1,000 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Te-1 (7.7 mm)|Type 89 'special' (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 2 x 7.7 mm Type 89 'special' machine guns, dorsal turret (450 rpg = 900 total)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Te-1 machine gun, nose turret (483 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Te-1 machine gun, 2 x cockpit turrets (483 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Te-1 machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (483 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Te-1 machine gun, ventral turret (483 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Te-1 machine gun, tail turret (483 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The main difference between the [[Ki-21-Ia]] and this Ki-21-Ic is armament, 2 x Te-1s compared to 7 x Te-1s which are simply the best 7.7 mm Japan can offer, with a rate of fire of 950 rpm, API - IT belts in the universal belt which do a lot of damage and covers the whole plane.

If attacked by fighters, it is important to remember and recognize the Ki-21's turning capabilities. It is actually possible to win lateral turn fights against fighters with this aircraft as she is one of the most manoeuvrable bombers if not the most manoeuvrable bomber in game.

This aircraft has the ability to hold up to 1,000 kg of bombs in several different variations: 20 x 50 kg, 10 x 100 kg, 4x 250 kg, and 2 x 500 kg. Use the 20 x 50 kg or 10 x 100 kg bombs to attack light tanks and light pillboxes. They are not viable against bigger targets, since direct hits are needed to destroy. This loadout is particularly useful on maps that have an abundance of non-moving targets (light pillboxes) or lightly armoured targets (armoured cars or AA trucks for example). Use either of the 4 x 250 kg or 2 x 500 kg payload to destroy heavier targets such as medium tanks, pillboxes, destroyers, and cargo ships.

Although unconventional, this aircraft is a fantastic weapon if you want to bait the enemy. Ideally, you would want to attract a higher flying enemy down to you and to get into a turn fight. This way, depending on the enemy aircraft you can out manoeuvre and distract him while teammates fly down to finish him off.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very manoeuvrable
- Extensive bombload for a rank I Japanese bomber
- Decent cruising speed
- Durable, can take some hits
- Above average defensive armament for its BR
- Internal payload

'''Cons:'''

- Loses effectiveness with altitude
- No armour
- Falls quickly when attacked by multiple foes
- Head-on attacks are usually fatal because of lack of protection for the pilots
- Gunners can be knocked out easily

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

{{main|Ki-21-Ia#History|l1=History of the Ki-21-Ia}}

'''About the plane'''

The first-generation Ki-21, or Ki-21-I Kô (Model IA), was a full-metal monoplane bomber. Its cantilever wing was implanted in the middle position. The crew positions were largely glazed, providing good visibility for the five crewmen. The landing gear included two train legs fitting almost completely into the two engine nacelles, plus a non-retractable tailwheel. The two engines were Nakajima Ha-5 Kai, with unit power of 850 hp (1,000 hp at takeoff), each driving a three-bladed metal propeller with variable pitch. Serial production really began in 1938 in the Mitsubishi and Nakajima factories.

'''Combat usage'''

The first available aircraft were engaged in China during Summer 1938, where they were well-received by the crews of the army. The first reports on the commitment of these planes enabled Mitsubishi to make changes, particularly in terms of armaments. This led to the development of new versions, such as Ki-21-Ib (乙, otsu) and finally Ki-21-Ic (丙, hei).
