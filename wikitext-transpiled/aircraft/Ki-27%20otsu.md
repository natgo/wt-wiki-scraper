== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].

The Allied reporting name for this plane was "Nate"; however, it was also called "Abdul" in the "China Burma India" theater by many post-war sources.

The Ki-27 is a frontline fighter for interwar/pre-WW2 historical engagements such as the Battles of Khalkin Gol. In most maps, the Ki-27 will distinguish itself as a low-level dogfighter: its performance below 1,000 m is superb and it can manoeuvre away from nearly any other comparable fighter. Like the [[Ki-10 (Family)|Ki-10 series]] before it, the Ki-27 otsu suffers from its poor armament (twin 7.7 mm Type 89s) and weak armour, which means it makes for a poor interceptor despite its high speed, but the Ki-27 makes an excellent escort for bombers and flying boats to provide cover for their allied bombers.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Like its Ki-10 predecessor, the Ki-27 relies on its manoeuvrability for its survival. Therefore, turnfighting is vital for a Ki-27 pilot. Avoid diving on opponents, due to the Ki-27's fuel feed issues, and focus on scaring enemy pursuers away from bombers rather than chasing a kill. A lone Ki-27 is easy prey for allied energy fighters. Like most Japanese fighters, engaging an enemy head-on is not recommended. If fighting an enemy energy fighter head-on, a good strategy is to turn away (usually a slight turn as you'll want him to miss you, but also pass you), and hope that he turns to follow.

Like the comparable [[A5M4]], the Ki-27's carburettor engine suffers from fuel feed issues in negative G manoeuvres, like diving. Nosing down will cause the engine to choke out. Positive G manoeuvres like the Split-S are preferred. This issue will allow enemies to out dive the Ki-27, so engaging at low altitudes is preferred.

Additionally, the Ki-27 runs hot and will overheat at 100% throttle on all but the coldest maps. To cool off, ease the throttle back to 40% or 50% and, if possible, try to gain altitude. If the engine overheats during a dogfight, try to break off if the opportunity presents itself. No pilot can outmanoeuvre on an overheated engine.

Compared to the [[Ki-43-I]], it has marginally better manoeuvrability with a very low stall speed around 91 km/h (49 knots) with landing flaps deployed. However, the Ki-27 retains the power-to-weight ratio of the Ki-10 biplane, allowing it to climb very steeply at a 45° climb angle.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Ki-27 does not have any armour, so your great turn rate is the only real defence. The fuel tanks aren't self-sealing either, which only strengthens the need to use your great turn rate. There is one fuel tank above and behind the oil cooling system; the rest are in the wings, with 2 in each wing.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

At this rank, the order of research is mainly personal preference, though the Ki-27 Otsu will benefit significantly from defensive and performance enhancing modifications.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 89 (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.7 mm Type 89 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
A superior dogfighter for turnfighting, the Ki-27 is the first plane to begin showing the features typical of the Japanese [[A6M2|"Zero"]] but with none of the bite. Its speed and manoeuvrability are plagued by engine problems, with no armour and a standard armament.

In battle, no Allied fighter can outturn you, except for biplanes, but most will outgun you (and even most biplanes match the Ki-27 in armament).

Biplanes make easy prey for the Ki-27, and it can easily outmanoeuvre the [[P-36C]], the [[F2A-1]] and the [[I-16 type 24]], but their stronger armaments will knock out a Ki-27 in a single good burst. Simply outrunning any of them is an excellent evasive manoeuvre. [[Hurricane Mk I/L]]s can strictly compete with the Ki-27 Otsu in manoeuvrability, but the Hurricane's heavier armament (four times that of the Ki-27) can also quickly shred a Ki-27. Additionally, outrunning a Hurricane in a Ki-27 is not possible. The [[I-15bis]] will be the bane of a Ki-27s existence, as their excellent turning ability will force it into energy bleeding manoeuvres or Boom & Zoom style combat.

;Enemies worth noting

Despite its low battle rating, you can face some challenging foes when flying the Ki-27. Biplanes will give you a run for your money in terms of manoeuvrability, while some early monoplanes will be faster and more heavily armed than you. Therefore, it is important to judge your foes accordingly.

From America, you will face the [[P-26 (Family)|P-26]]. They are quite good divers and have a decent roll rate, but will not be able to outmanoeuvre you in a turn fight. The [[P-36 (Family)|P-36]] is more challenging. Faster and well-armed, you will have to rely on your turn rate to try and outmanoeuvre them.

Then from Germany you also have the He 100 D-1, which is fast. Its energy energy retention is good as which means that it will bleed speed far slower than you. The best way to fight it is to lure it into a dogfight to bleed its energy. If the He 100 D-1 breaks off the engagement, runs away and is out of your shooting distance, you should just break off too but be prepared for it to come back.

One of the most challenging opponents is the [[I-153 M-62]] Chaika. It is not a mere upgraded [[I-15bis]], but in all performance aspects equal to the Nakajima Ki-27 fighter. Also on the Soviet side, the [[MiG-3 (Family)|MiG-3]] is a significant threat. It is one of the fastest aircraft in its battle rating and has powerful armament. In skilled hands, it can be an almost impossible opponent to combat, especially when using Boom & Zoom tactics against you. Your only defence will be to try and outmanoeuvre it or to lure it into a turnfight.

=== Development ===
The Nakajima Ki-27 otsu began as the Ki-11, a competitor for the [[Ki-10-I|Kawasaki Ki-10]] biplane. While faster and more modern than the Ki-10 biplane, the Ki-11 wasn't adopted because the Imperial Japanese Army valued manoeuvrability over speed. Nakajima continued development of the design before finalising the Ki-12, a modern monoplane with a liquid-cooled engine and retractable landing gear, but the Army denied it outright as too maintenance heavy for forward airbases in Manchuria and China. The redesigned plane instead featured a radial air-cooled engine, fixed landing gear and fully enclosed cockpit and received the designation Ki-27.

In 1936, the Ki-27 competed against the Kawasaki Ki-28 (a prototype design fated to never enter production) and the Mitsubishi Ki-33 (a de-navalised [[A5M4|A5M]]). While the Ki-33 outperformed the Ki-27 in most regards, the Imperial Japanese Army was loath to adopt a "navy fighter", and approved the Ki-27 with minor modifications. The Ki-27 entered service as the Army Type 97 Fighter.

=== Service History ===
While the Ki-10 would not be finally phased out from front line service until 1942, by 1940, the Ki-27 was the primary army fighter on the front lines. It was unmatched by any plane in the Chinese air force inventory, and outperformed the Soviet [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]] and [[I-16 (Family)|I-16]] fighters in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, with some pilots scoring 11 kills against Soviet planes in a single day. Against Chinese Curtiss [[P-36A|P-36 Hawks]], veteran Ki-27 pilots achieved similar, but not as impressive kill rates.

Over China, the Ki-27 was unmatched until the deployment of the [[P-40E-1|P-40 Warhawks]] with the American Volunteer Group. After America's entry into the war, the Ki-27 also fared poorly against the US Navy's F2A Brewster Buffalo and F4F Wildcat and was removed from most front line service within the first months of the war, replaced by the much-improved Ki-43. However, it remained a front line fighter in Thai service, where the Ki-27 scored recorded kills against [[P-51D-30|P-51]]s and at least one [[P-38G-1|P-38]].

Because of their high production numbers and relatively few losses, Ki-27 would see a renewed role late in the war as Kamikaze planes.
