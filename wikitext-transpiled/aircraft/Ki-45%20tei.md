== Description ==
[[File:A Ki-45 flying over Guadalcanal .png|alt=Be careful when a enemy gets on your tail. The Ki-45 can be out-maneuver by almost every other rank one plane |thumb|A Ki-45 flying over Guadalcanal]]<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the last mass produced variant of the Ki-45 series of fighter/striker aircrafts. It was the successor of the Ki-45 hei, a variant dedicated to engage naval assets. This version was conceived as a night fighter, equipped with the same 37mm Ho-203 autocannon as that found on the Ki-45 "otsu/乙" and "hei/丙". However, this time it came with two fixed 20mm Ho-5 cannons in Schräge Musik-style positions as well as its Type 98 7.92mm MG on the back operated by the gunner/radio operator.

Being a classed as a heavy fighter, the Ki-45 isn't the best in the manoeuvrability category. However, for a heavy fighter, it manoeuvres very well. It is even capable of out-turning aircraft such as the [[P-47D-25]]. Unlike heavy fighters of other nations, the Ki-45 series does not feature aircraft with large amounts of heavy weaponry. This is a major downside, considering how heavy fighters traditionally give up manoeuvrability and speed for armament. Instead, the Ki-45s utilize more of an equilibrium between manoeuvrability, speed, and armament. These are what makes the Ki-45 both a capable dog-fighter, and bomber hunter.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 16 mm Steel plates behind the pilot

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Instead of focusing on armament like other heavy fighters, the Ki-45 is more balanced between armament and flight performance. While the default ammunition belts for both weapons on the Ki-45 ko are workable, it can help to upgrade. Unlocking the flight performance modules will help drastically in dogfights and turn fights.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Ki-45 tei features the first "Schräge Musik" armament of the series. Wielding one Ho-204 37 mm cannon and two Ho-5 20 mm cannons, the Ki-45 tei is the definition of a bomber hunter. Its 37 mm cannon allows the Toryu to take down bombers with ease, and its dual 20 mm cannons allow for even more flexibility in the bomber hunting department. Although deadly, the 37 mm cannon only holds 15 rounds, so shot placement is crucial. The round itself also travels fairly slowly in the air, making it hard to hit fast moving enemy fighters. The 20 mm cannons are best used in a secondary weapon role, as they are fixed at an upward angle. To use these weapons, one must bind a key to them via the in-game controls menu (it is on the first page that comes up, basic). Unique to the tei model, this Ki-45's ground attack role is improved due to the ability to equip bombs.

The Ki-45 tei also retains its impressive turn rate from the [[Ki-45 otsu]]. Although the aircraft itself is large and presents an "easy target" in many players' minds, the Ki-45 is rather nimble. Use this to your advantage when engaging enemy aircraft. Unfortunately, the Ki-45 is a heavy fighter, meaning its turn time is still not on par with other aircraft such as the [[F2A-3]]. In certain cases, the Ki-45 pilot may have to rely on their tail gunner to get the job done. The "tei" version of the Ki-45 features a 7.92 mm Type 98 machine gun with 1050 rounds. Although somewhat lacklustre, with a few well-placed shots, it is possible to destroy enemies on the aircraft's tail. Aim for the pilot or the engine, as those are generally the weakest points on most aircraft. If the tailing enemy is a biplane, aim for the wings since they are very fragile.

The Toryu is also rather fragile for a heavy fighter. Although it does feature two engines, the Ki-45 does not have very much armour protection. Only the back of the pilot's seat and the nose has armour, leaving both the gunner and engines unprotected. This can prove costly in a fight. If one does find him or herself tailed, call upon teammates for assistance.

* In simulator, the Ki-45 has a decent frontal view with large pieces of glass in front, on top and to the sides, ensuring great visibility. The gunsight has enough room under, allowing easy tracking and leading of targets. However the side views are terrible as the wings & engines block out most of the view downwards, and a thick frame blocks out the upper area, as a result the common way of circling above an area to spot something is extremely limited. Rear visibility is almost non existent with the entire tail obstructed by the headset.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

Initially designed to be a bomber escort, the Ki-45 was first deployed in what is now China and Vietnam. It was found to be easily outclassed by P-40s piloted by the Flying Tigers. As a result, the Ki-45's role was changed to anti-shipping and ground attack, where it performed satisfactorily. Nonetheless, the Ki-45's greatest strength proved to be its bomber intercepting capabilities. Heavily armed with 37mm cannon, the Toryu (Dragon Slayer) could destroy heavy bombers with ease. As the war progressed, the need for an interceptor to defend the Japanese mainland was ever present. Soon, the Ki-45 was deployed to counter B-29 Superfortress raids. Although its armament was clearly deadly enough, the Ki-45 suffered at high altitudes. Pilots soon resorted to ramming attacks against the Superfortresses. Special attack groups specifically designed for this purpose formed, but by late 1945 Imperial Japan's fate had been sealed. The Allies allocated the name "Nick" to the Ki-45.

Kawasaki Ki-45 KAI Tei (Model D) Type 2 Toryu (Allied reporting name: Nick) twin-engine army fighter

The Ki-45 KAI Tei fighter-bomber was built along with the night-fighter variant.

The armament on this version included one 37 mm Ho-204 cannon, with 15 rounds, mounted in the forward fuselage, and two 20 mm Но-5 cannons, with 100 rounds each, mounted at an angle in the upper fuselage.

Bomb racks were mounted under the centre wing section, one on each side of the fuselage, to suspend two 250 kg bombs.

The nacelles of the Mitsubishi Ha-102 engines had individual jet exhaust pipes to increase speed and reduce exhaust glow at night. Also, the barrels of the Но-5 cannons were equipped with flame arresters.

One Ki-45 KAI Tei aircraft was equipped with a 75 mm anti-tank gun, but its recoil proved to be too high for the fighter's relatively lightweight design.

Some early Ki-45s were also modified in the field to carry bombs. These planes were used at the end of the war by kamikaze pilots to perform suicide attacks.

Four Ki-45s were used by the Japanese for the plane's first suicide attack on Allied ships on May 28, 1944.

The Ki-45's production was discontinued in July 1945. A total of 1,701 Ki-45s were manufactured in all versions, including all prototypes and pre-production vehicles.
