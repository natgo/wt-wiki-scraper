=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 68 mm Bulletproof glass in front of the pilot
- 12.5 mm Steel plate in front of the pilot
- 16.5 mm Steel plate behind the pilots
- 12.5 mm Steel plate behind the dorsal gunner
- 12.5 mm Steel plates surrounding the dorsal gunner
- 12.5 mm Steel plates in front of the tail gunner

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Being a bomber, speed is not necessarily an important attribute, however, payload and armament are. Upgrading the bombs allows for more target flexibility and damage potential while turret upgrades will help survivability. the turret belts and the ''New Turret'' upgrades are useful. The ''New Turrets'' upgrade will allow you to fire the turrets for longer periods of time and having access to multiple ammunition belts is also helpful. The engine upgrades are also useful in that they will help you reach your target faster and will control engine temperature. Having all of the weapons upgrades will help drastically in unlocking the other modules on this aircraft.

The best way of grinding with this aircraft is to play cautiously and to use communication. As with any bomber, if you're caught alone or off guard you are an easy target for enemy fighters and attackers. Although not a sure tactic, having a fighter escort will boost research point gains drastically. This goes for both arcade and realistic battles. Generally, try to destroy as many targets as possible without wasting bombs. If done in a speedy fashion it is possible to drop multiple payloads in realistic battles. The same goes for simulator battles. In arcade battles, having a high reload speed and a fighter escort will allow for constant bombardment. If done correctly, flying the {{PAGENAME}} in all modes will net you large amounts of research points.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Army Type 94 GPHE (50 kg)|Army Type 92 GPHE (250 kg)|Army Type 92 GPHE (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 12 x 50 kg Army Type 94 GPHE bombs (600 kg total)
- 4 x 250 kg Army Type 92 GPHE bombs (1,000 kg total)
- 1 x 500 kg Army Type 92 GPHE bomb (500 kg total)

The Ki-49-I shares the same somewhat lacking bombload options as all other members the [[Ki-49 (Family)|Ki-49 family]], although being at a lower BR than the rest of them makes it slightly more acceptable. It is able to carry a maximum bomb load of 1,000 kg (in the form of 4 x 250 kg bombs). By comparison there are bombers around this battle rating can carry double that. The best loadout is generally the 4 x 250 kg bombs as it is by far the largest total load; the 12 x 50 kg bombs are not much use on account of their small size and thus limited damage. Although a reduction in total bomb load, the single 500 kg bomb can also be useful against ground targets, due to its larger blast radius.

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Ho-1 (20 mm)|Type 89 (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 20 mm Ho-1 cannon, dorsal turret (150 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Type 89 machine gun, nose turret (483 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Type 89 machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (483 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Type 89 machine gun, ventral turret (483 rpg)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Type 89 machine gun, tail turret (828 rpg)

The defensive armament of the Ki-49-I is similar to the other members of the [[Ki-49 (Family)|Ki-49 family]]. While the 20 mm cannon is certainly nice to have, its effectiveness is somewhat limited by being blocked from shooting directly rearwards by the aircraft's tail; it also cannot shoot downwards thanks to its location on the top of the aircraft. The rest of the defensive armament is generally weak consisting of single 7.7 mm machine guns.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Ki-49's role is a low-altitude medium bomber capable of destroying ground targets such as pillboxes and tanks. Although hindered by a low total bomb capacity, this aircraft is renowned for its impressive manoeuvrability. This being said, it is very easy for the Ki-49 to hover above an area and drop all of its payloads rather quickly. Heavy bombers such as the G8N1 Renzan have a harder time due to their sheer size and slow rate of turn. Make sure to select the 4 x 250 kg bomb load outs if attacking targets like tanks, pillboxes, or smaller ships.

If attacked by fighters, it is important to remember and recognize the Ki-49's turning capabilities. It is actually possible to win lateral turn fights against fighters with this aircraft. Try not to act like a "sitting duck" because the Ki-49 features little armour protection and has limited defensive capabilities as far as weapons go. With only 7.7 mm machine guns, this aircraft is not suited for air to air combat against fighters. The best belt to use is the armoured targets belt. If you can't shake someone off your tail aim for the pilot or the engine - your only hope of destroying the enemy plane. Pulling hard manoeuvres will throw the enemy off and allow you to set up for more defensive fire.

This aircraft has the ability to hold up to 1,000 kg of bombs in several different variations. 12 x 50 kg bombs, 4 x 250 kg bombs and 1 x 500 kg bomb. Use the 12 x 50 kg bombs to attack light tanks and light pillboxes. They are not viable against bigger targets since direct hits are needed to destroy. This loadout is particularly useful on maps like Zhengzhou where there is an abundance on non-moving targets (light pillboxes). Use the 4 x 250 kg bombs to destroy heavier targets such as medium tanks, pillboxes, destroyers, and cargo ships. They are also the best loadout against mini-bases. Use the 500 kg bomb to destroy targets like carriers.

In Arcade battles, this aircraft is particularly proficient at bombing bases, especially with a maxed reload crew skill. Since the Ki-49 can virtually turn on a dime, instead of having to line up longer bombing runs like heavy bombers this aircraft can "hover" over the base or airfield and attempt dive attacks. It's also possible to use this same tactic against pillboxes or tanks. With fighter cover, a good reload time skill and good aim it's possible to destroy dozens of ground units.

Although unconventional, this aircraft is a fantastic weapon if you want to bait the enemy. Ideally, you would want to attract a higher flying enemy down to you and to get into a turn fight. This way, depending on the enemy aircraft you can outmanoeuvre and distract him while teammates fly down to finish him off.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Variety of payload options
- Multiple gunners for protection in almost all directions
- Armour protection around pilots and gunners
- Highly manoeuvrable and decent climb rate for a medium bomber
- Self-sealing fuel tanks
- Very good in taking out individual ground targets
- Internal payload creates no drag
- Has a tendency of being ignored due to low payload capacity
- Less prone to damage unlike the [[G4M1]]
- Two pilots

'''Cons:'''

- Very poor choice for bombing bases especially in arcade battles
- The wing is an entire fuel tank, therefore any hits to the wing can cause fuel tank fires
- Maximum payload is only 1,000 kg
- Defensive armament is relatively poor
- Poor roll rate
- Unlike the G4M1, 20 mm is mounted upwards, therefore it cannot fire at targets at the level directly behind the plane
- Is outclassed by bombers from other nations within its BR in nearly every aspect except manoeuvrability
- Weak engine horsepower

Nakajima Ki-49-I Donryu Army Bomber, type 100 model 1 (code name "Helen")

Twin-engine monoplane medium bomber with retractable landing gear and tail wheel. The development of a new medium bomber (heavy bomber, by Japanese standards) for the Japanese Army Air Force began in the spring of 1938. The new airplane was to replace the Mitsubishi Ki-21 bomber.

Based on Japan's experience in its war with China, special attention was given to providing the bomber with high speed capabilities and strong defensive weaponry so that it could operate without fighter cover. The crew needed protective armor, and self-sealing fuel tanks were essential.

The first prototype of the Ki-49 (#4901) made its first flight in August of 1939. Production of the aircraft began in August 1940, and the plane was designated as the Nakajima Ki-49-i Donryu ("Storm Dragon"), type 100 model 1.

The Ki-49-i was equipped with two air-cooled 14-cylinder radial Hakadzima Ha-41 engines rated at 1,250 hp each. The plane's defensive armament included 1 Ho-1 Type 97 20 mm cannon in the upper fuselage and five 7.7 mm Type 89 machine guns (which were significantly modernized versions of the Vickers), located in the nose, sides, and underneath the aircraft. In addition, one gun was located in a tail turret, the first time such a turret was employed by an aircraft of the Japanese army. The bomb bay, which occupied almost the entirety of the aircraft's middle section, could carry bombs ranging from 100 to 250 kilograms, in various combinations. A normal load was 750 kilograms, an overweight load, up to 1,000.

The new planes began to be delivered to the front in August of 1941 and were widely used over New Britain and New Guinea as well as in raids on the Australian port of Darwin.

It soon became evident that the Ha-41 engine's power was insufficient, and the controllability of the aircraft suffered as a result. The bomber's speed was not high enough to outrun the newer fighter planes. However, pilots approved of the plane's armor, the power of its defensive weaponry, and the reduction of that weaponry's "blind spots".

In all, 128 Ki-49-i aircraft were constructed.
