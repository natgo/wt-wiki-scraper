== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]] in the [[wt:en/news/4868/current|"Operation S.U.M.M.E.R." event of 2017]] after earning 13 pilot Marks of Distinction.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

There is limited armour protection for the pilot and other modules, but the coverage is not high. All the main modules - engine, fuel tanks, oil coolers - are located in the front of the fuselage and the inner part of the wings. This means the modules would likely absorb bullets coming from the front before they could harm the pilot, but the aircraft would likely be crippled after that. From the rear there are no major modules, but that also leaves the pilot very vulnerable from the rear.

- 70 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen
- 8.5 mm Steel plate in the nose, behind engine

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Ho-155 (30 mm)|Ho-5 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 30 mm Ho-155 cannons, wing-mounted (100 rpg = 200 total)
- 2 x 20 mm Ho-5 cannons, wing-mounted (200 rpg = 400 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Army Type 94 GPHE (50 kg)|Army Type 92 GPHE (250 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 2 x 50 kg Army Type 94 GPHE bombs (100 kg total)
- 2 x 250 kg Army Type 92 GPHE bombs (500 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Tachikawa Ki-94-II should be used as a Boom & Zoomer and a Boom & Runner depending on the situation. The Ki-94-II should be above all enemy aircraft in order to Boom & Zoom. When used as a Boom & Zoomer, set the throttle to 20%-50%. The reason behind that is the Ki-94-II's engine response to throttle change from 0% to 100% or WEP is poor, it takes 5 seconds or more for the engine to go back to full power which can be a leave the plane really vulnerable if you're trying to climbing back to altitude without engine power. If you meet players at your height, that's when Boom & Run comes into place. After going head-on with them (if you do), do not turn back to them. Level your plane out and keep flying straight to gain speed and keep doing that until the enemy pilot turns away. After that, climb more then resume Boom & Zoom.

The Ki-94-II has a powerful engine, producing up to 2,440 hp in-game. It has long wings which resemble the ones of the Ta 152. The Ki-94-II's elevator is very responsive at 500-700 km/h which is impressive for a prop aircraft. However, the climb rate of the Ki-94-II is abysmal without modifications. With all modifications, it can climb with P-47s. The Ki-94-II is a durable plane, it can take quite a few hits to its airframe without dying immediately. However, the fuel tanks are not well-protected, so expect them to get lit on fire fairly easily.

The Ki-94-II's main role is bomber intercepting but it can also be used as a fighter. As said earlier, the Ki-94-II should climb above all enemies by side-climbing to Boom & Zoom. Boom & Run is used if you and another enemy are at the same altitude, level the plane out and keep flying straight until the enemy turns away. Stick to your teammates in case you need help.

Spitfires are your worse enemy. They climb and turn better. P-47s can be problematic, but the Ki-94-II can out-turn them with proper use of flaps, elevator keys and throttle control. P-51Ds can also be an issue of the pilots behind them know what they're doing. Bombers such as the B-17, the B-24 and the B-29 are not much of a threat as the Ki-94-II's main role is to intercept them, however look out for their gunners as they can be deadly.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very good firepower, 30 mm cannon bests Brownings at velocity
- Efficient ammunition usage thanks to slow firing cannons and having more ammo than other rank IV Japanese fighters
- Good roll rate
- High red-line speed of over 800 km/h
- Excellent at high speed turning, retains good control and energy at speed
- Strong and effective flaps

'''Cons:'''

- Horrible stock performance
- Default belts for the 20 mm is not good, although 30 mm is decent
- Engine response to throttle is poor; takes approximately 5 or more seconds for the engine to go back to full power after setting it from 0% to 100% or WEP
- Mediocre acceleration overall
- Mediocre climb rate compared to planes at battle rating
- Is bested by most fighters unless at extremely high altitudes

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Ki-94-II was Tachikawa Aircraft Company's response to the Japanese Imperial Army Air Force demands for a fast, high altitude interceptor featuring heavy armament as soon as Japanese intelligence learned about the B-29 to counter the B-29 raids as the aircraft available at that time for the IJAAF were inadequate to combat B-29s. The Ki-94-II was developed from the original Ki-94; the Ki-94-I which was an experimental high altitude interceptor with 2 propellers and a twin-tailed boom configuration (such as the tail of the Venom and the Vampire), one was a normal propeller on the front and the other was a pusher prop on the back. The Ki-94-II was created by Tatsuo Hasegawa. There were 2 prototypes of the Ki-94-II, one was fitted with a 4-blade propeller and the other one was to be fitted with a 6-blade propeller however the war ended before any of the prototypes made their maiden flight so the project was cancelled. The aircraft had 2 x 20 mm Ho-5 cannons and 2 x 30 mm Ho-155-I cannons, 150 rpg per 20 mm and 30 mm, 600 rounds in total.
