== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].

The Kikka is a fast and versatile fighter-bomber. It starts out with a single 30 mm and you will have to research the 'otsu' mod before you can obtain the second 30 mm. It is important you utilize your speed to your advantage, as that is its biggest advantage against most aircraft it encounters. A good turner at high speed, but at low speed you may find it difficult to turn, as well as to regain your speed. Always maintain an energy advantage over your enemies, so you can quickly engage and disengage your targets. Never try to keep on them unless you know you have the advantage. The Kikka is a small aircraft which has great acceleration and climb, so it shines in vertical energy retention. It is recommended you do not 'head-on' other targets until you have acquired the ''Otsu'' mod. The Kikka is a very durable and well armoured aircraft, so it can take a multiple hits in a head-on.

Regarding its bombing capabilities, equipping a bomb (either 500kg or 800kg, both of which are heavy) makes the Kikka significantly slower and more difficult to control. Speed is a must with the Kikka, and it is recommended you perform high-speed dive bombing to ensure both the destruction of your target and escaping slower pursuers. The speed previously gained in a dive can now be maintained by your unburdened plane. Make sure to use the rocket boosters to take off, or else the aircraft will have significant difficulty taking off with bombs equipped, and you will be unable to retract its landing gear.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Kikka has a good acceleration rate for its BR, as well as climb rate, and low top speed compared to later jets. The pilot is quite heavily protected from the front and rear by both armour, and the fuel tanks are self sealing. The (wing mounted) engines, on the other hand, take damage easily, and minor damage to them will further slow the plane to speeds that some props can match.

Its 30 mm guns have a low rate of fire and low ammo count, but are very powerful and can down fighters with a few solid shots. The stock belt is lacking and it is recommended to research and use the tracer belt (HEF-T). There are no AP rounds, the closest thing being the "practice" shell, merely an unfilled HE shell. Strafing is discouraged as the guns simply arent a threat to anything but open-topped vehicles.
[[File:CockpitImage_Kikka.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inside the cockpit of the Kikka]]

The Kikka should be played as a Boom & Zoomer. It has a great roll rate so it can still catch enemies that attempt to dodge it. Many pursuers can be outrun by going into a slight dive, and rolling to avoid enemy fire. Super props like the P-51H-5NA can catch the Kikka in certain situations, though the Kikka's top maintainable speed is much higher than theirs.

To attempt to gain the upper hand on a Kikka, propeller planes should dive from at least 2,000 m above the Kikka to be able to catch it. If the Kikka goes into a tight turn fight, it will generally bleed its energy, making it an easy target to be defeated by prop planes, which is usually the case when a jet attempt to engage a prop in a turnfight.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Early jet fighter that can frequently see prop aircraft
- Can carry either a heavy 800 kg or a 500 kg bomb
- Can use flaps at high speeds (roughly 550 km/h = 341 mph)
- Good at diving as long as it has enough performance modules
- 30 mm cannons are hard hitters
- Good climb rate and vertical performance
- Great energy retention
- Good roll rate
- Exceptional cockpit visibility to the sides/rear

'''Cons:'''

- Limited ammo, only 50 shells per gun
- Somewhat poor turn rate
- Only one 30 mm gun when stock
- Adding payload will hinder handling significantly due to the planes light weight and small size
- Slow if compared to later jets
- Prop planes will out turn you
- Cockpit visibility to the front is noticeably obstructed, with an extremely crude sight in the form of a stick

[[File:FighterImage_The second test flight of the Nakajima Kikka.jpg|thumbnail|right|The second test flight of the Kikka - 11th August 1945.]]
The Nakajima Kikka was Japan's first entirely turbojet-powered aircraft, designed as a cheap and fast special attack plane for envisioned decisive battles in the defense of Japan. Whilst a general resemblance can be seen to the German [[Me 262 A-1a|Me 262 Schwalbe]], this is only due to superficial characteristics such as the under-wing engine nacelles and roughly triangular fuselage. In terms of detailed structural design, the two are not directly related.

The Japanese were not able to receive all of the information that was provided through a negotiation on 1944 with the German high command over the licensing for the BMW 003 and Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet engines. Examples and plans were lost with the sinking of submarines that carried the important cargo, however all was not completely lost. A single BMW 003A diagram was saved as it was flown in to Japan separate from the submarine I-29. Upon further inspection of the BMW 003A diagram, the Japanese designers were able to garner enough information in compound with their previous developments to lay out the plans of more feasible turbojets.

This plane is sometimes incorrectly identified in IJN designation as J9N or J9Y, but, like all other Japanese "special attack" (suicide) planes, it was only given the formal name of Kikka ("橘花"). It was formerly called "Kōkoku Nigō Heiki" (興国二号兵器, "Prospering Country Mk.2 Weapon")

[[File:FighterImage_Naval Technical Arsenal Ne-20, 1945.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Ne-20 engine that powered the Kikka]]

Work began on newer engine designs. Ultimately the Kūgishō Ne-20 engine was the one selected which was a Japanese design based on the format of the BMW 003A. The Kikka was developed as a special attack plane to attack vessels from invading fleets. The airframe was simple to mass-produce, and the engines could operate on low-grade fuels. The armament consisted of only a single 500 or 800 kg bomb. However, the prototype aircraft would not fly until August 7th 1945, by which time the Japanese were rapidly running out of time. It would attempt flight again on August 11th 1945, but was heavily damaged during an aborted takeoff due to trouble with the RATO units. That would be the last time the aircraft would fly again as just days later, the surrender of Japan was broadcast over the radio, signalling the end of the Kikka development.

A fighter variant for intercepting B-29s with improved Ne-20 Kai engines and two Type 5 30 mm cannons was under development during 1945, but the war ended before there was a prospect of completing it.
