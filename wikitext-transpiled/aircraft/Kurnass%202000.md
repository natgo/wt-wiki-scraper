== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was an upgrade package for the [[F-4E Phantom II]] by the IAF. The upgrade focused on the aircraft armament and electronic systems. While upgrades to the power plant were proposed, with the introduction of more powerful engines, this modification was not installed to reduce costs. The Kurnass 2000 received a new radar, the AN/APG-76, that was far superior to the AN/APG-120 used by the standard F-4E. It also was equipped with the ASX-1 TISEO targeting system which allowed Raphael Popeye ASMs to be launched. More advanced avionics and targeting systems for anti-tank munitions and guided bombs were installed, as well as the ability to carry the AIM-9L and Python 3 missile.

Introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], the Kurnass 2000 is an Israeli upgrade of the venerable F-4E Phantom II. It looks and flies almost identically to the standard F-4E, however its air-to-air armament is now drastically improved and rounded out by the all-aspect AIM-9L Sidewinder and Python 3 for closer engagements. For anti armour situations, it has access to the IR guided AGM-65D Maverick and new Paveway II laser guided bombs, coupled with its Pave Spike targeting module. The Kurnass 2000 is a multirole aircraft with impressive systems and weapons, only held back by the performance of its old airframe compared to 4th generation opponents like the [[MiG-29]] and [[F-16A]]. The Kurnass 2000 also features an EEGS for its cannon, like the one featured in all 4th generation fighters, it's very good for gun kills, especially in simulator battles. It also has a very powerful radar (although no radar-guided missiles) and can carry a total of 290 countermeasures.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Air RB:'''

In Air RB, the Kurnass 2000 could be compared to the [[F-4EJ Kai Phantom II|F-4EJ Kai]], having the same air-to-air missile armament and similar radar. To properly utilize the 8 potent missiles and one of the best radars in game is the major task that every Kurnass 2000 pilot will have to face. Typically, enter the battle at a low altitude and shooting down everyone on your way is a viable and effective way to fly the Kurnass 2000. Climbing could also be attempted, but given the presence of AIM-54s and 4th generation fighter jets featuring the same avionics and significantly higher climb rate, it would be a riskier style to fly the Kurnass 2000.

A major difference between the Kurnass 2000 and the F-4EJ Kai is the slats on the Kurnass' wings. At high speed, extension of the slats provides more lift and limits the angle of attack of the aircraft, resulting in a significant decrease in speed loss during turns to a level even comparable to the level of 4th generation aircraft like the F-16 and MiG-29. At lower speed, the slats also increase the overall manoeuvrability of the aircraft, so it is advised to extend the slats in battles (by toggling "combat flaps"), especially when fighting in groups, retracting them when needed to gain more speed or for higher angle of attack. Overall, the slats of the Kurnass provides pilots with the ability to alter the aerodynamics of the aircraft during combat, and provide more versatility and a higher overall performance compared to the F-4EJ Kai.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* One of the most effective air-to-air armament sets in-game with AN/APG-76, Python 3s, and AIM-9Ls
* Can carry six IR-guided air-to-air missiles
* Wing slats for increased manoeuvrability and versatility
* High level of manoeuvrability at high speed as with any other Phantoms
* Guided bombs and missile with targeting pod for engaging ground targets
* Equipped with an IR-guided ground attack weapon, the AGM-65D

'''Cons:'''

* Big and heavy aircraft
* Thrust to weight ratio less than 4th generation jets
* Lack of radar-guided missiles
* Despite having a targeting pod and a camera on the wing, neither has a thermal camera, which can make difficult to identify targets at long range

The Kurnass 2000 was an Israeli program intended to extend the service life of the existing F-4s in the IDF Air Force. A major part of the program was to improve the avionics and the aging airframes. New displays, cameras, and computers were implemented during the program, greatly enhancing its capabilities over a standard F-4E. In addition, fuel tank leaks were fixed and parts of the airframe were reinforced. F-4Es were also to be upgraded with the APG-76 radar over the standard APQ-120 radar. The Kurnass 2000 also received the ASX-1 TISEO targeting system which allowed Raphael Popeye ASMs to be launched.

The Kurnass 2000 was also intended to receive an engine upgrade. Pratt & Whitney PW1120 engines were proposed by the IDF/AF to be fitted to the F-4s and a test bed was built to examine the performance. The test bed was originally meant for the IAI Lavi project, but it also proved the enormous performance increase over Phantoms with the J79 engines. The P&W-powered F-4 was able to pass Mach 1 without afterburner, increase climb rate by over 35 percent, and had a 15% increase in sustained turn rate. Although ambitious, the upgraded F-4Es never received this engine upgrade largely due to costs. Thus, the main differences between the Kurnass 2000 modernized Phantoms and the regular F-4E were almost exclusively avionics and some airframe changes.
