== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

The Kurnass is an Israeli-operated version of the American [[F-4E Phantom II]]. Besides the desert camouflage, it differs slightly in the selection of weapons, mainly in having AIM-9D/G Sidewinder missiles instead of the AIM-9E/J and lacking access to the GBU-15(V)1/B guided bomb. Otherwise, it is the same workhorse with high speed and a large arsenal.

The Kurnass's weapons will be largely familiar to previous US pilots. The change in Sidewinder variants compared to the original F-4E is worth discussing in more detail: as a US Air Force variant, the American F-4E has USAF models of the Sidewinder in the form of the stock AIM-9E and the top AIM-9J. The Kurnass on the other hand has US Navy Sidewinders as seen on the USN [[F-4J]] or the British [[Phantom FGR.2]]: the stock AIM-9D and the top AIM-G. As far as stock missiles go, the AIM-9D is greatly preferable to the AIM-9E with better range and maneuverability. The AIM-9J vs AIM-9G comparison is more up to personal preference, as the former has slightly higher overload and fares better in maneuvering combat while the latter has a wider seeker view and is better for sneak attacks at a distance. Thus, while the Kurnass has the maneuverable F-4E airframe with an internal gun for close in fights, its Sidewinders do not quite lean in that direction.

Another Sidewinder-related quirk of the Kurnass is that two of the recessed fuselage pylons, which are normally reserved for Sparrows, can instead be used to carry Sidewinders, so its maximum IR missile capacity is 6x instead of the 4x of other Phantoms. This is often a reasonable trade to make, because although the AIM-7E2 Dogfight Sparrows offer the Kurnass a decent long-range option, they are held back by the radar's lack of look-down-shoot-down capability. Carrying four of them at once adds nearly 800 kg of weight that decreases performance. Bringing only two Sparrows for special occasions and stocking up on lighter Sidewinders reduces the need to jettison unnecessary weapons.

The only change to the ground attack weapons is the lack of access to the GBU-15(V)1/B, a TV-guided glide bomb available on the inboard wing pylons of the American F-4E. The similar GBU-8, which can be dropped at supersonic speeds but is not as efficient in gliding, is still available on all wing pylons. Many CAS players will choose the smaller AGM-62A Walleye guided bombs or the AGM-65B Maverick air-to-ground missiles for tank busting instead, so the lack of the GBU-15 only really matters in unusual situations like needing to bomb enemy SPAA from extreme ranges.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The F-4E Phantom II is well-suited for most in-game situations. For attacking ground targets, the plane is armed with an assortment of bombs, rockets, and missiles. Against air targets, players may employ the vehicle's deadly air-to-air missiles and frontal cannons. Three externally-mounted gunpods may be equipped. Although they will undoubtedly increase the vehicle's destructive capabilities, they also appreciably hinder flight performance through induced drag. In many situations, one front-facing cannon is all that is required to dispatch an opponent aircraft. As for the missiles, the ones used by this plane are average at its rank, comparable to the [[R-60]] missiles equipped by the [[MiG-21MF (Germany)]] and the [[MiG-21SMT]] (albeit with worse manoeuvrability). The [[AIM-9G Sidewinder|AIM-9G]] missiles are most effective when fired from between 2 to 4 km away from the target. Any closer will make it harder for the missile to hit the target and the end result could be a miss. At higher altitudes the [[AIM-7E-2]] missiles can ensure better results when shot from 4 - 6 km range as they are almost impossible to dodge at these heights.

The F-4E has a high rate of climb. This is however where most of its performance advantages end. Due to its weight, the Phantom has rather mediocre acceleration, and not a very high top speed. It is not advised to dogfight anything other than Starfighters and other Phantom variants, as the F-4E has a very poor turn rate. Although the aircraft has better energy retention than most of its opponents, it still bleeds considerable amounts of speed while turning, which can't be regained very quickly due to the aircraft's heavy weight. It also performs quite poorly at low speeds, which is also caused by its weight.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Vast variety of air and ground ordnance
* Good top speed
* Equipped with RWR and countermeasures
* Can carry up to 8 potent AAMs
* 20 mm M61 cannon has great ballistics, high damage and high rate of fire
* Good acceleration

'''Cons:'''

* Relatively large aircraft is a big, easy to hit target
* Carrying payloads reduces flight performance
* Limited ammo for the internal 20 mm cannon which can be depleted in just a few bursts
* Wings can be ripped off easily during high speed manoeuvres
* Radar is not look-down capable

Israel was a prominent user of the [[F-4 Phantom II (Family)|F-4 Phantom II]], having acquired its Phantoms starting in 1968. At first, the USA was unwilling to offer Israel the F-4, but developments in 1967-1968 led the USA to reconsider its position. Notably, a French embargo of Israeli aircraft and the defection of a Soviet MiG-21 convinced the USA to sell its F-4Es to Israel. The first of these aircraft arrived in January of 1968, nicknamed Kurnass (Heavy Hammer) in service.

Israeli Phantoms saw their first combat action in the War of Attrition (1967-1970) against Egypt, where they were used against Egyptian ground and air targets. During this time, more Phantoms continued to be delivered including six RF-4E reconnaissance Phantoms. During the Yom Kippur war, Israeli Phantoms were once again used against air and ground targets. This conflict also marked the debut of the AGM-65 Maverick in Israeli service shortly after the missile entered service with the USAF.

In total, Israeli Phantoms scored ~116 aerial kills against Arab aircraft between 1969-1982 compared to ~55 combat losses (total number disputed). The last Phantom was delivered in 1976, with a total of 204 aircraft delivered, including some as replacements for aircraft lost during the Yom Kippur war. In the last decades of the 20th century, the Phantom was complemented with newer aircraft such as the F-15 and F-16; the last Israeli Phantom was retired in 2004.
