== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Shortly after the end of WWII in Europe, following the advancements from first generation jet-fighter projects such as the Sukhoi [[Su-9|Aircraft K]] prototype and the [[Yak-15]] family, the Soviet Union laid down a new set of requirements for a second generation jet fighter project. The main candidates were Mikoyan's [[MiG-15|I-310]] prototype, Yakovlev's [[Yak-30D|Yak-30]] prototype, and Lavochkin's '''Project 52'''. Project 52 differed from the competitors, as the project was for not one, but two aircraft. These two aircraft were designated '''La-174''' and '''La-174D''', the only difference being that the normal 174 used the reverse engineered Rolls-Royce Derwent engine, while the latter 174D used the Rolls-Royce Nene engine. In the end, only the Derwent powered prototype (reverse engineered as the Klimov RD-500 engine) was chosen to enter production as the [[La-15]]. However, due to the exponential advancements in technology in the early '50s, the La-15's service would be short lived, as more advanced aircraft with supersonic capability entered service and quickly replaced it, such as the new [[MiG-19 (Family)|MiG-19]] and [[MiG-21 (Family)|MiG-21]].

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update 1.39]], is one of the rarest jets in the game, as it was only made available in limited time periods on 2 occasions: during the 2014 [[wt:en/news/833--en|Lavochkin's 114th birthday]] and 2017 [[wt:en/news/4961-special-the-la-174-is-back-en|Lavochkin's 117th birthday]] events. The two conditions to obtain the La-174 were that the La-15 had to be researched first, and the La-174 had to be researched ''and'' purchased during the event. Outside of these two short and exclusive events, the La-174 is otherwise unavailable. The La-174 is a very early prototype of the [[La-15]] found in the tech tree, and as such, the La-174 possesses very minor differences in performance and a different colour scheme. Due to being an almost identical early prototype to the tech tree La-15, the aircraft plays almost exactly the same: Relying on its very powerful engine and high thrust output to best its opponents in energy based engagements, while staying cautious of its own speed, as the aircraft can easily rip its wings in a straight line with the absurd engine power. Players flying this aircraft should also be wary of the early air-to-air missiles they can face when uptiered, as these weapons negate the speed advantages of the La-174.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 155 mm bulletproof glass - Windscreen
* 6 mm steel - In front of pilot
* 8.5 mm steel - Pilot's headrest
* 8 mm steel - Pilot's seat
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (3 behind pilot)

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

* It is recommended to unlock in this order: ''Fuselage Repair'', ''Offensive 23 mm'' and ''Compressor''.
* In the second tier: ''Airframe'' then ''New Boosters'' <br>
* Third tier: ''Wing Repair'' then ''New 23 mm cannons'' <br>
* Final tier: ''Engine'' then ''Cover''

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 3 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, nose-mounted (100 rpg = 300 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Due to its incredible top speed for its battle rating, competing with the fastest at its battle rating, the La-174 should be employed in boom and zoom tactics. Gain altitude (and thus energy), and use this energy to execute hit-and-runs on opposing aircraft. Your powerful 23 mm NR-23 cannons will help you kill targets in minimal time. Despite the fact it is very manoeuvrable, it suffers from the issue of having incredibly weak wings, and they will likely snap if you attempt to turn fight other jets at high speed. However, if it needs to turn, it can hold its energy for an extended period and come out of a turn at a higher speed than most opponents.

====Specific enemies worth noting====
<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->
'''F-86 Sabre/CL-13A Sabre:'''

The F-86 Sabre is one of the main rivals of the La-174 if up-tiered and facing allied teams. The Sabre can easily outmanoeuvre, outrun and out climb the La-174. The best way to counter the Sabre is to attack it when it is at its most vulnerable position (low on energy, or damaged) or force it into a low-speed manoeuvring fight. Do not try to engage an F-86/CL-13A Sabre in any high-speed manoeuvres or any high-speed dogfighting in general as the Sabre will come out on top. In any low-speed manoeuvres, the Sabre will lose to the La-174 in any manoeuvring engagements.

'''Meteor:'''

The Meteor is another main rival of the La-174 as the La-174 can meet the Meteor at any time from being down-tiered to up-tiered. While the La-174 can outrun and out-climb early variants of the Meteors, the later variants are far harder to outrun and out climb as they can easily catch the La-174. The best way to deal with Meteors is to apply boom and zoom tactics, but do remember a skilled Meteor pilot will have no issue avoiding a La-174 that is attacking with boom and zoom tactics. Avoid any manoeuvring fights with any variant of the Meteor as they will outmanoeuvre you with no issues at all.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Cannons have a decent rate of fire and punch
* Good energy retention
* Decent acceleration
* Cockpit visibility is above average
* Decent manoeuvrability around 500-700 km/h (310-435 mph)
* Good roll rate
* Great top speed for its battle rating

'''Cons:'''

* Can rip its wings off in level flight
* Ineffective air brakes
* Guns have poor accuracy and very low muzzle velocity
* Recoil from guns causes the plane to pitch during firing
* Inherits the general Russian trait of very low ammo reserves, limiting the battle time
* Doesn't take battle damage very well, especially to the wings of the aircraft

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
As a prototype of the [[La-15]], the La-174 saw no combat experience. Only one was ever built, and it crashed during flight testing. Compared to the production version of the La-15, it was powered by a British Rolls-Royce engine, rather than the Soviet-made Klimov RD-500k which was derived from the aforementioned British turbojet engine.
