== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.39]]. The La-174 is a prototype variant of the La-15, possessing slight differences in performance and a variant colour scheme, and was made available in limited time periods on 2 occasions: during the 2014 [[wt:en/news/833--en|Lavochkin's 114th birthday]] and 2017 [[wt:en/news/4961-special-the-la-174-is-back-en|Lavochkin's 117th birthday]] events. The plane must have been researched ''and'' purchased during this time, and is otherwise unavailable. Another condition to research the La-174 was that the La-15 had to be researched first.

The La-174 shares many of the same attributes as the La-15, and thus shares the same general strengths and weaknesses as its brother. The La-174 is an incredibly fast aircraft for its tier but suffers from various issues. The La-174 is unable to carry any secondary armaments, such as bombs or rockets. It is equipped with three very powerful 23 mm cannons. These carry 100 rounds of ammunition per gun, which works out a total of 300 rounds of ammunition.

Due to its incredible top speed for its battle rating, competing with the fastest at its battle rating, the La-174 should apply boom and zoom tactics. Gain altitude (and thus energy), and use this energy to execute hit-and-runs on opposing aircraft. Your powerful 23 mm NR-23 cannons will help you kill targets in minimal time. Though it is not the worst jet at turning, it suffers from the issue of having incredibly weak wings, and they will likely snap if you attempt to turn fight other jets at high speed. However, if it needs to turn, it can hold its energy for an extended period of time and come out of a turn at a higher speed than most opponents.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 155 mm bulletproof glass - Windscreen
- 6 mm steel - In front of pilot
- 8.5 mm steel - Pilot's headrest
- 8 mm steel - Pilot's seat
- Self-sealing fuel tanks (3 behind pilot)

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

- It is recommended to unlock in this order: ''Fuselage Repair'', ''Offensive 23 mm'' and ''Compressor''.
- In the second tier: ''Airframe'' then ''New Boosters'' <br>
- Third tier: ''Wing Repair'' then ''New 23 mm cannons'' <br>
- Final tier: ''Engine'' then ''Cover''

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 3 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, nose-mounted (100 rpg = 300 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Due to its incredible top speed for its battle rating, competing with the fastest at its battle rating, the La-174 should be employed in boom and zoom tactics. Gain altitude (and thus energy), and use this energy to execute hit-and-runs on opposing aircraft. Your powerful 23 mm NR-23 cannons will help you kill targets in minimal time. Despite the fact it is very manoeuvrable, it suffers from the issue of having incredibly weak wings, and they will likely snap if you attempt to turn fight other jets at high speed. However, if it needs to turn, it can hold its energy for an extended period and come out of a turn at a higher speed than most opponents.

====Specific enemies worth noting====

<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->

'''F-86 Sabre/CL-13A Sabre:'''

The F-86 Sabre is one of the main rivals of the La-174 if up-tiered and facing allied teams. The Sabre can easily outmanoeuvre, outrun and out climb the La-174. The best way to counter the Sabre is to attack it when it is at its most vulnerable position (low on energy, or damaged) or force it into a low-speed manoeuvring fight. Do not try to engage an F-86/CL-13A Sabre in any high-speed manoeuvres or any high-speed dogfighting in general as the Sabre will come out on top. In any low-speed manoeuvres, the Sabre will lose to the La-174 in any manoeuvring engagements.

'''Meteor:'''

The Meteor is another main rival of the La-174 as the La-174 can meet the Meteor at any time from being down-tiered to up-tiered. While the La-174 can outrun and out-climb early variants of the Meteors, the later variants are far harder to outrun and out climb as they can easily catch the La-174. The best way to deal with Meteors is to apply boom and zoom tactics, but do remember a skilled Meteor pilot will have no issue avoiding a La-174 that is attacking with boom and zoom tactics. Avoid any manoeuvring fights with any variant of the Meteor as they will outmanoeuvre you with no issues at all.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Cannons have a decent rate of fire and punch
- Good energy retention
- Decent acceleration
- Cockpit visibility is above average
- Decent manoeuvrability around 500-700 km/h (310-435 mph)
- Good roll rate
- Great top speed for its battle rating

'''Cons:'''

- Can rip its wings off in level flight
- Ineffective air brakes
- Guns have poor accuracy and very low muzzle velocity
- Recoil from guns causes the plane to pitch during firing
- Inherits the general Russian trait of very low ammo reserves, limiting the battle time
- Doesn't take battle damage very well, especially to the wings of the aircraft

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

As a prototype of the [[La-15]], the La-174 saw no combat experience. Only one was ever built, and it crashed during flight testing. Compared to the production version of the La-15, it was powered by a British Rolls-Royce engine, rather than the Soviet-made Klimov RD-500k which was derived from the aforementioned British turbojet engine.
