== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 "Advancing Storm"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.''

== Armaments ==

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|N-37D (37 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 3 x 37 mm N-37D cannons, chin-mounted (50 rpg = 150 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Speed is your greatest advantage. The La-200 can outrun every jet at its BR and even some jets at higher BRs. At the beginning of a match try to gather speed as soon as possible. In an 8.0 game, if you accelerate up to about 1000km/h no one will catch you even if they dive on you. You can use your speed to zoom climb and surprise any climbing (or unsuspecting) players. Remember that other fighters will be more manoeuvrable and that you can't afford taking any hits (top speed drops horribly if you get hit). Always make sure that you have enough energy to run away from the enemy if you miss. And you will miss a lot, the 37 mm cannons are hard to lead and quite inaccurate, so I wouldn't recommend using them on long distances. They are, however, extremely effective when they hit (one shot is almost always enough) so it's possible to get many kills without landing.

===Radars===
{{main|Toriy}}
The La-200 is equipped with a [[Toriy]] search radar, located in the radome in the centre of the air intake.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Extremely high top speed for its battle rating
- Able to break the sound barrier in a dive
- Insane roll rate for Soviet standards, specially at high speeds
- Good acceleration up to 800 km/h
- Good climb rate and acceleration provides great zoom climb capability
- Hard-hitting guns with decent rate of fire
- Second pilot takes over if the first one is knocked out
- Effective airbrake
- Flaps can help turn (if used properly)
- Has access to a target detection radar with decent range

'''Cons:'''

- Acceleration rate drops significantly above 800 km/h
- Horrible low speed performance
- Top speed drops dreadfully in case of any hull damage
- Elevator locks up at high speeds, can lead to a crash if you're not careful
- Guns have some noticeable dispersion
- Guns are hard to aim due to very low muzzle velocity
- Guns have relatively low ammo count (50 shells for each gun, 150 total)
- Huge target with no armour
- Bad cockpit visibility
- No payload (no access to bombs/rockets)
- Very high landing speed (>240 km/h), hard to land even with no damage

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In 1948, Soviet high command issued a requirement for a two man, all-weather, twin -engined jet interceptor that would be capable of carrying a new type of radar system called "Toriy" (Thorium). All three Soviet design bureaus (Lavochkin, MiG, and Sukhoi) developed a prototype for testing.

Lavochkin's design, the La-200, had a long fuselage to accommodate its two turbojet engines, swept wings, and a large cockpit for two men. The La-200 took its maiden flight on September 9th, 1949. It was the only aircraft of the three designs to pass initial trials.

By the early 1950s, the La-200 was ready to enter production under the official designation La-17. However, due to the appearance of the Yak-120 (later known as Yak-25), which surpassed the La-200's performance in testing, the La-200 order was cancelled in favor of the Yakovlev design.

Only a single prototype of the La-200 was ever built, and it was modified several times during development to improve performance, correct flaws, and test other radar systems.
