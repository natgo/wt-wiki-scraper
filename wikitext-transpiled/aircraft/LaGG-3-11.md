== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. This aircraft was introduced in [[Update 1.33]].

== General info ==
Like the other LaGG-3 models, the 3-11 has the advantage of an extremely low BR and cannon armament. The top speed is comparatively high when put against planes such as the [[P-36G]] or [[Ki-43-II]]. The climb rate is also quite good, attributed to the high max speed and acceleration. However, the turn rate and elevator are extremely poor. Energy fighting is a must when it comes to the LaGG-3.

Since the LaGG-3 has cannon armament, a 2-4 second burst is all that is needed to shred an enemy plane. Use Ground Target belts for the best effect with both the ShVAK and Berezin UB.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.''

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|ShVAK (20 mm)|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm ShVAK cannon, nose-mounted (150 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, nose-mounted (200 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FAB-50 (50 kg)|FAB-100 (100 kg)|RBS-82|RS-82}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 50 kg FAB-50 bombs (100 kg total)
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100 bombs (200 kg total)
* 6 x RS-82 rockets
* 6 x RBS-82 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The LaGG-3-11 is best use as a multirole fighter with a good climb rate, making boom and zoom a viable tactic, but turn fighting can help when facing less nimble aircraft. The armaments are nose mounted and fewer in number than most counterparts, making this plane less beginner friendly. Accuracy and trigger discipline are more important as there won't be much rounds when pulling the trigger, but when the rounds hit, it deals effective damage.

In ground realistic battles, the FAB-100 bombs are a good choice to take out tanks and should be prioritized over rockets. At this plane's BR, the bombs will be more than enough to take out a tank or two. Using the vehicle's climb speed after bombing is preferable to scout the battlefield for unsuspecting aircraft. Boom and zoom is the best tactic to catch most aircraft off guard.

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The LaGG-3-11 was a Soviet fighter aircraft of World War II. It was one of the most modern aircraft available to the Soviet Air Force at the time of Germany's invasion in 1941. The plane was produced 1941–1944 and first took flight 28 March 1940. Approximately 6,528 LaGG-3-11's were made, and designed by V. P. Gorbunov.

As a result of further work on transforming the LaGG from a "pure" fighter into a light attack aircraft, the LaGG 3 Series 11 appeared at the turn of 1941–1942. It had missile equipment and DZ-40 bomb racks for two bombs weighing up to 100 kg.

To reduce the plane's weight and finally increase its flight characteristics to acceptable levels, the series 11 completely lacked outboard fuel tanks, sacrificing flight range for speed. Suspended fuel tanks were intended for use when necessary, but in practice, they were only installed on a small batch of fighters made for the navy.

The following bombs could be suspended on the DZ-40 bomb racks underneath the wing: FAB-50 and FAB-100 general-purpose bombs, AO-25 fragmenting bombs and VAP-6M aerial spray instruments. These bomb racks could also carry ZAP-6 incendiary aerial instruments containing 38 liters of incendiary fuel each, or PSB-100 suspended fuel tanks containing up to 100 liters of gasoline.

RO-82 launchers for RS-82 rockets were also installed under the wing. The standard design allowed for the installation of six RO-82 launchers. Combat units armed the LaGG-3 with rockets themselves, so the number of rockets varied between four to eight RS-82 rockets.

Several planes were equipped with RO-132 rocket launchers instead of the RO-82, in order to launch the more powerful RS-132 rockets.

The LaGG-3 Series 11 went into production at the end of 1941. The first LaGG-3 Series 11 fighter-bombers took part in combat in the final stage of the Battle of Moscow, on the Kalinin front. Use of the LaGG-3 as a fighter-bomber and attack aircraft was relatively successful, as the LaGG-3 planes demonstrated higher combat survivability than other types of fighters.

Later on, the LaGG-3 Series 11 was replaced by the Series 23 in manufacturing facilities. The Series 23 was practically identical to the Series 11 and had the same combat characteristics. Their production continued from the end of the winter of 1942 to the summer of 1942 and was the peak period of LaGG-3 fighter manufacturing in terms of quantity.
