== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. The LaGG-3-23 is one of the rarest vehicles in the game and in War Thunder's history, the LaGG-3-23 has only been given out five times, including as a reward during War Thunder's [[wt:en/news/2598--en|2nd Anniversary]] in 2014 and [[wt:en/news/7945-special-happy-anniversary-war-thunder-en|10th Anniversary]] in 2022.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.''

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|ShVAK (20 mm)|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm ShVAK cannon, nose-mounted (150 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, nose-mounted (200 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FAB-50sv (50 kg)|FAB-100sv (100 kg)|RBS-82|RS-82}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 50 kg FAB-50sv bombs (100 kg total)
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (200 kg total)
* 6 x RS-82 rockets
* 6 x RBS-82 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good offensive armament and decent ammunition capacity
* Relatively good climb rate

'''Cons:'''

* Engine overheats when flying at 100 % trottle
* Controls tend to lock up at higher speeds

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

As a result of further work on transforming the LaGG from a "pure" fighter into a light attack aircraft, the LaGG 3 Series 11 appeared at the turn of 1941–1942. It had missile equipment and DZ-40 bomb racks for two bombs weighing up to 100 kg.

To reduce the plane's weight and finally increase its flight characteristics to acceptable levels, the series 11 completely lacked outboard fuel tanks, sacrificing flight range for speed. Suspended fuel tanks were intended for use when necessary, but in practice, they were only installed on a small batch of fighters made for the navy.

The following bombs could be suspended on the DZ-40 bomb racks underneath the wing: FAB-50 and FAB-100 general-purpose bombs, AO-25 fragmenting bombs and VAP-6M aerial spray instruments. These bomb racks could also carry ZAP-6 incendiary aerial instruments containing 38 litres of incendiary fuel each, or PSB-100 suspended fuel tanks containing up to 100 litres of gasoline.

RO-82 launchers for RS-82 rockets were also installed under the wing. The standard design allowed for the installation of six RO-82 launchers. Combat units armed the LaGG-3 with rockets themselves, so the number of rockets varied between four to eight RS-82 rockets.

Several planes were equipped with RO-132 rocket launchers instead of the RO-82, in order to launch the more powerful RS-132 rockets.

The LaGG-3 Series 11 went into production at the end of 1941. The first LaGG-3 Series 11 fighter-bombers took part in combat in the final stage of the Battle of Moscow, on the Kalinin front. Use of the LaGG-3 as a fighter-bomber and attack aircraft was relatively successful, as the LaGG-3 planes demonstrated higher combat survivability than other types of fighters.

Later on, the LaGG-3 Series 11 was replaced by the Series 23 in manufacturing facilities. The Series 23 was practically identical to the Series 11 and had the same combat characteristics. Their production continued from the end of the winter of 1942 to the summer of 1942 and was the peak period of LaGG-3 fighter manufacturing in terms of quantity.
