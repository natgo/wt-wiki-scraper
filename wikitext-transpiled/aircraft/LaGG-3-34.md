== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update_1.41#19.06.2014_-_1.41.27.12|Update 1.41.27]] through the [[wt:en/news/668--en|LaGG-3-34 starter pack]]. From 2014 to 2019, it was purchasable in the store as part of several premium packs but was removed at the beginning of 2019. It was also made available in parallel in the [[Warbonds]] shop as a random prize of the Vehicle battle trophy from [[wt:en/news/5738-news-how-can-you-get-premium-vehicles-warbonds-en|September 2018]] to March 2019 and from [[wt:en/news/6605-news-premium-vehicles-for-warbonds-until-the-31st-of-march-en|March 2020]] to October 2020.

The LaGG-3-34 is a modification of the LaGG-3 with a nose-mounted 37 mm NS-37 autocannon that can be equipped with a variety of belts, including AP. As such, it can fight late biplanes and early fighters but will suffer in low altitude engagements due to its weight. However, if used as a heavy fighter (maintaining energy, using altitude and avoiding furballs), the LaGG-3-34 is extraordinarily effective in dealing with planes and tanks.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 37 mm NS-37 cannon, nose-mounted (36 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, nose-mounted (200 rpg)

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Combat tactics
The LaGG-3-34 is very powerful against attacker/bomber aircraft, and though the NS-37 isn't the most accurate, they are large targets you can usually take them out with relative ease. As such it is best to stay at high altitudes in order to dive on enemy bombers. The NS-37 is the same cannon as in the Yak-9T, so players experienced with that aircraft will feel right at home in this aircraft. The LaGG-3-34 can also provide ground support when equipped with AP rounds, although the slight inaccuracy with the cannon can make it difficult at long ranges against tanks.

The Berezin 12.7 mm machine should really always have Air target rounds since it's not very useful when attacking ground targets. Even then it's best used to line up shots for the NS-37: fire a few bursts with just the 12.7 mm until you hit the target, then shoot one or two rounds of 37 mm. This should be all you need to bring down an aircraft at your battle rating.

One interesting effect of this plane is that many enemies will try to head-on you since they will not recognize the aircraft tag and confuse it with a LaGG-3-35. These battles are easily winnable with the 37 mm cannon, as it has the ability to knock out enemy fighters with a singe shot.

;Specific enemies worth noting
Due to the added weight of the large cannon, this plane has excellent energy retention in the vertical but quickly bleeds it while turn fighting. It struggles to keep pace after it loses speed, so players must be wary of any engagements that take place in the horizontal. Many American aircraft at this tier have the ability to out-turn you with flaps, so remain vigilant and do not be lulled into lower altitudes. German and Italian fighters will outperform you at altitude, so it is best to engage them at some distance with the 37 mm.

;Counter-tactics
Many people will head-on this aircraft if you use it as a fighter instead of an interceptor. Fire off a few shots with the 37 at .6 km, and then pull up or down to avoid their fire. Any damage to your engine can be fatal, as the glide characteristics of this modification of the LaGG are not very good. Bombers are wary of all aircraft approaching them. As such, coming from directly behind is not advisable. Blasting a wingtip off of a bomber from above is an excellent way to avoid being hit by most gunners.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list.

'''Pros:'''

* Very large and powerful nose-mounted gun for rank II
* NS-37 gets HEFI-T* rounds which can take out enemy planes with a single hit
* Good manoeuvrability at its typical speeds
* Has access to 36 shells for the 37 mm gun (6 more than the [[Yak-9T]])
* Semi-rare variation of LaGG-3 to see in the battles, a nasty surprise to the enemy
* Heavy weight allows for excellent speed gain in dives, be careful with lock up

'''Cons:'''

* NS-37 isn't very accurate when firing long bursts
* Low ammo count for the Berezin UB 12.7 mm heavy machine gun
* Poor cockpit rear view, a recurring problem with LaGG-3s
* Easily outmanoeuvred by British and Japanese fighters of same rank
* Poor manoeuvrability at low speeds and suffers some locking up at high speeds
* Due to the weight it has some issues with energy retention

These planes were used during the battle of Stalingrad with great success against enemy bombers. However, recoil and centre of gravity issues plagued the plane, and the extra weight caused them to suffer from worse performance than other LaGG-3s, which were already somewhat underpowered. The fact that the Il-2s were considered just as effective against ground targets, and the test flight of the Yak-9T which proved a much better platform for the NS-37 gun, spelt the end to this variant of the LaGG-3 with only 40 being produced.

In as early as 1940, M.I. Gudkov had the idea of installing large-calibre cannons on the LaGG-3 in order to combat enemy armoured vehicles. In the spring of 1941, Y.G. Taubin and B.G. Shpitalny began to develop a model of the fighter equipped with 37 mm cannons.

But development was put toward an anti-tank model of the LaGG-3 (the series 34) with the Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 engine-mounted 37 mm cannon. The NS-37 cannon was installed in the cavity between the engine cylinders instead of the 20 mm ShVAK cannon. The NS-37 cannon's barrel extended significantly beyond the propeller spinner, and was installed in place of the propeller's lengthened hollow shaft with a ratchet.

This meant that the plane's armament consisted of a 37 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 cannon with 12 shells and a 12.7 mm synchronized Berezina UBS machine gun with 200 rounds, installed in the nose section of the fuselage above the engine and to the left.

Wing-mounted bomb racks were not installed. Automatic slats were installed on the wing panels to improve the plane's runway characteristics and manoeuvrability at low flight speeds.

The anti-tank LaGG-3 with its NS-37 cannon successfully passed state testing, but it took until 30 December 1942 for the military to adopt the cannon itself. Nonetheless, aircraft plant No. 31 in Tbilisi produced the LaGG-3 Series 34 in the autumn of 1942. According to various estimates, between 40 and 65 LaGG-3 Series 34 planes were built.

Planes of this model saw successful use in combat at Stalingrad. Firing from the 37 mm cannon did not shake the plane, and accordingly, did not affect firing accuracy, which was particularly important in battles against armoured vehicles.

But the 37 mm NS-37 cannon significantly increased the plane's weight and affected its center of gravity, which seriously reduced its flight characteristics. In addition, the plane's structure poorly withstood the cannon's strong recoil. Further production of this model was stopped in connection with the unacceptable drop in its flight characteristics.
