== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.31]].

The LaGG-3-66 is a jack-of-all-trades type of fighter aircraft. It does not have many weaknesses but does not have many advantages. When flying the LaGG-3-66, it can be used in a variety of roles depending on what you are engaging in combat. Always keep in mind certain planes you battle may be better than the LaGG-3-66 at something.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm Steel - Plate behind pilot's seat
* 55 mm Bulletproof glass

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Primary upgrade targets are "Compressor" and "Engine" to improve the dogfight performance. Offensive 12.7 mm and Offensive 20 mm belts are next in the priority list. The other upgrades can be chosen at one's own preference, but the additional payload modules are cheap to get as tier 2 and 3 and can be good stepping stones to unlock the next tiers.

== Armaments ==

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|ShVAK (20 mm)|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm ShVAK cannon, nose-mounted (150 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, nose-mounted (200 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FAB-50 (50 kg)|FAB-100 (100 kg)|RS-82|RBS-82}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 50 kg FAB-50 bombs (100 kg total)
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100 bombs (200 kg total)
* 6 x RS-82 rockets
* 6 x RBS-82 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in an aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
[[File:Cockpit_LaGG-3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The LaGG-3's instrument panel.]]
The LaGG-3-66 compared to others in the LaGG-3 series offers a little more performance but trades it with a higher BR. This plane is a "jack of all trades, master of none" type of aircraft. When the LaGG-3-66 gets up-tiered, it will face opponents in far superior planes that will outperform the LaGG-3-66 with no issues. Therefore, when flying the LaGG-3-66 in up-tiered matches, keep your energy high and always force the enemy to fight on your terms.

When using this plane, it can be used in a variety of roles depending on what ordnance (secondary weapons), you may carry:

* Bomber Hunter: the LaGG-3-66 is a capable bomber hunter, especially when using the rockets. Bombers that you would meet will easily disintegrate from a single rocket hit the majority of the time or be crippled so badly that they will eventually crash. Also, the cannon and machine gun on the plane can do damage to enemy bombers as well, it will take some time but eventually the enemy bomber will go down.

* Air Superiority: the LaGG-3-66 is a capable air superiority fighter as it can fight as an energy or turn fighter depending on what you face. But no matter what happens, you must always keep your energy up. There is a high chance in the LaGG-3-66 to face planes that can outperform this plane with no issues except in low-speed manoeuvres.

====Specific enemies worth noting====
<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->

* [[Spitfire (Family)|Supermarine Spitfires]] - The Spitfire is a plane to be feared when flying the LaGG-3-66 as many of the key strengths the LaGG-3-66 has, the Spitfire has (if not better). When battling the Spitfire, always try to go for the initial hit as early Spitfires (Spitfire Mk I/IIa) do not react well to damage. If you are battling cannon armed Spitfires, always go for the initial hit but remember the cannon armed Spitfire has far superior firepower compared to the LaGG-3-66 and will have no issues destroying the LaGG-3-66. Always remember not to get into manoeuvring fights with Spitfires as they will easily outmanoeuvre the LaGG-3-66 at any speeds.

* [[Ki-43 (Family)|Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa]] and [[A6M (Family)|Mitsubishi A6M Reisen]] - When battling these planes, altitude is everything. These two Japanese planes will have no issue outperforming a LaGG-3-66 in manoeuvrability. Therefore when facing these two enemy planes, use Boom and Zoom tactics to defeat them. The Ki-43 and the A6M are some of the few planes that the LaGG-3-66 will face that can easily defeat the LaGG-3-66 at low-speed manoeuvring air to air combat.

* [[F4U (Family)|Vought F4U Corsair]] and [[F6F (Family)|Grumman F6F Hellcat]] - The Corsair and the Hellcat should be feared as their firepower (compared to the LaGG-3-66's firepower) and superior speed are major factors to watch out for. Do not try to outrun or go for head-on attacks if possible when confronting the F4U Corsair or the F6F Hellcat. Turn fighting is your best chance of success as the LaGG-3-66 will have no issue out turning them.

* [[C.205 serie 1|Macchi C.205]] - This plane is another key enemy of the LaGG-3-66. The Macchi C.205 is a capable enemy that can outperform the LaGG-3-66 in every category except at low speeds. When facing the Macchi C.205 try to force low-speed turn fighting, eventually, the advantage will fall to the LaGG-3-66.

====Counter-tactics====
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->
Countering the LaGG-3-66 is going to become a case of what your plane's advantage is. The LaGG-3-66 does not have many weaknesses nor does it have any major advantages. Therefore to shoot down the LaGG-3-66 is going to come down to what your plane's advantage is over the LaGG-3-66. If you are in a plane that has a higher BR than the LaGG-3-66, more than likely your plane's advantages will easily outweigh the LaGG-3-66's advantages except in low speed fights.

The series 66 planes were the last series model of the LaGG-3. Outwardly, fighters of this series could be differentiated by their new cockpit canopy (the same one used on the La-5), and its frontal bullet-proof glass. Additional changes included a lighter fuselage frame, altered airvent shape and the installation of bomb rack fairings.

As with the Series 35 fighters, the LaGG-3 Series 66 was equipped with an expanded water radiator, an altered airvent shape, automatic wing slats and a retractable tail wheel. The plane's aerodynamics were significantly refined. In particular due to altered water and oil radiator tubes and newly installed fairings on the exhaust pipes.

The VISh-61P propeller was replaced with the VISh-105SV, which had wider blades. The propeller spinner also became slightly wider and took on a flatter shape.

LaGG-3 Series 66 fighters were practically never used as attack aircraft, so they did not receive missile equipment.

Factory No. 31 in Tbilisi produced LaGG-3 Series 66 planes starting in the spring of 1943. In June 1944, production of the LaGG-3 ceased once and for all.

The LaGG-3 Series 66 was the lightest and most aerodynamic series of the LaGG-3s, but even they could not compare to the new Yak and La fighters. Nonetheless, planes of this model saw successful use in air combat above Kuban and in the storming of Novorossiysk. LaGG-3s were widely used in navy units in the Baltic and Black Sea fleets. In the final stage of the war, LaGG-3s were primarily used in economy-of-force operations due to their poor flight characteristics, and fought in the Baltics and the Karelian Isthmus. In August 1945, LaGG-3 planes took part in combat operations against Japan in the Far East. By the end of 1945, the air force had practically no LaGG-3s left in its combat units.

In total, 6,528 LaGG-3s were produced between the years of 1941 and 1944, with their production hitting its peak in 1942.
