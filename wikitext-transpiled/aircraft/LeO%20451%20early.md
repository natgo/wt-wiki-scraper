== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]].

The LeO 451 is a versatile high-speed medium bomber that is capable of undertaking low-level ground attack strikes against tanks, pillboxes, and other small targets. It also carries a fairly respectable bomb load for its battle rating, and can be used to destroy bases efficiently. The sleek, graceful lines of the LeO 451 represent a complete departure from the very angular, slab-sided Farman F.222.2 and SNCAC NC.223.3 heavy bombers. The LeO 451 sacrifices bombload for high speed, although at a 1,900 kg maximum load it still carries a respectable amount compared to similar bombers like the Petlyakov Pe-2 and the CRDA Cant.Z.1007bis Alcione series. It is also quite manoeuvrable for a twin-engine bomber.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, dorsal turret (120 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The LeO 451 can operate as a low-level attacker with relatively decent chances of survival thanks to the 20 mm dorsal gun and its relatively high performance. The LeO 451 is very fast, which is both to its benefit and detriment: it can outrun many enemies, but its wing rip speed is very close to its top speed. A prolonged dive of only 15 degrees, even with 0% throttle, can result in your wings ripping. This wing ripping problem is exacerbated by its good energy retention at high speed, making it harder to lose speed by turning even if combined with dropping throttle.

If pursued, it is best to manoeuvre in such a way that the enemy is forced to attack from the rear, which is covered by the 20 mm cannon. Flying at low altitudes also prevents enemies from attacking it from the rear and below, which is only covered by the 7.5 mm ventral gondola machine gun. The LeO 451 is otherwise very vulnerable to attacks from any other angle.

Defensive armament is concentrated against rear attackers, featuring a powerful Hispano HS.404 cannon in the dorsal gunner position, with a relatively ineffective 7.5 mm machine gun in the ventral gondola. The historical LeO 451 could retract this gondola to reduce drag; a feature that is sadly not represented in the game, as the lower drag would probably be more useful than the machine gun. The LeO 451 otherwise has no other defensive armament besides a fixed forward-firing 7.5 mm machine gun in the nose. This machine gun is useful for strafing soft targets like vehicles and artillery or taking potshots at aircraft but is generally not very useful otherwise.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent maximum bombload (2 x 500 kg, 4 x 200 kg, 1 x 100 kg for 1,900 kg total)
* Powerful dorsal turret with 20 mm cannon
* Relatively fast and manoeuvrable for a bomber
* Fixed 7.5 mm nose machine gun for strafing ground targets or attacking aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* Very limited defensive gun arcs: only the rear is covered
* Can only rely on the fixed 7.5 mm machine gun to defend against frontal attacks
* Ventral gunner is not protected by armour and easily knocked out
* Ventral turret armed with only one 7.5 mm machine gun
* Can be too fast, wings rip easily in slight dives even with 0% throttle.

[[File:LeO_bomber_002.jpg|400px|thumb|right|A LeO 451 bomber's final moments after a fatal engine fire.]]
Development of the LeO 451 began in the early 1930s, after the newly formed Armée de l'air issued the so called Plan I, intended to increase the number of modern military aircraft available to the French Air Force. As part of this plan, the young Air Force was keen on expanding and developing their strategic bombing branch. However, as the already available bombers, such as the Farman F.221, were considered unsuitable for the needs of the Air Force, a set of specifications was issued for the development of a brand new bomber. Among other aircraft manufacturers, Lioré et Olivier (which would be nationalized as part of SNCASE) also submitted their LeO 45 design. Being a long-time supplier to the French Air Force, Lioré et Olivier had a reputation of building reliable and effective bombers dating back to WW1. Thanks to this, the further development of the LeO 45 was approved. The first prototype (LeO 45-01), powered by a pair of Hispano-Suiza engines, took flight on 16 January 1937. Despite showing some minor issues, the LeO 45 prototype displayed excellent performance. A second prototype, equipped with a pair of Gnome-Rhone engines was also constructed and subsequently designated LeO 451-01. Testing of the 451 prototype began in October 1938.

However, due to various production issues associated with the Gnome-Rhone engine, production of the LeO 451 was delayed, beginning only in late 1938. Although the Armée de l'air only fielded a handful of operational LeO 451 bombers at the outbreak of WW2, their number would rise up prior to the Invasion of France in May 1940. During this chapter of WW2, the LeO 451 saw wide use against both advancing German forces on the east and Italian forces on the south. While the aircraft suffered great losses at the hands of Luftwaffe's superior fighters and the Wehrmacht's relentless anti-air guns, it fared a lot better on the southern front against Italian forces. Nonetheless, the LeO 451 did eventually retire in September 1957 as the final pre-war French aircraft to leave active duty.
