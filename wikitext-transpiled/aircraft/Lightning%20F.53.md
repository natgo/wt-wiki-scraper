== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

The Lightning F.53 is an export variant of the [[Lightning F.6]] which was used by the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) and the Kuwait Air Force (with the in-game vehicle representing a RSAF Lightning). The main difference between the Lightning F.53 and the standard F.6 version is that the F.53 can carry a selection of ground attack ordnance (bombs and rockets). The Lightning F.53 retains the stacked engines and side-mounted missiles, while adding to the list of unusual design choices with the unique ability to carry ordnance on top of the wings; something very few other aircraft were designed to do (the [[Jaguar GR.1A]] being a notable one).

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Lightning F.53 has an identical internal layout to the [[Lightning F.6]] upon which it is based. This means that most of the area in the wings is full of fuel tanks; likewise the stacked and staggered engines are retained. While the top engine is exposed and vulnerable to enemy attacks it can often absorb bullets, protecting the lower engine from damage (assuming the enemy is attacking you from the rear and above).

Where the Lightning F.53 does differ from the Lightning F.6 is in the addition of a 64 mm bulletproof glass windscreen. This is the only armour found on either aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good climb rate and acceleration.
* Formidable angle-of-attack above low speeds.
* Very powerful cannons, and good missiles.
* Surprisingly good turn rate between 800 and 1,000 km/h IAS.
* Large rocket payload.

'''Cons:'''

* Quite poor energy retention.
* Large target for enemy aircraft.
* Awkward under-belly cannon placement.
* Relatively low top speed (1,280 km/h IAS at sea level).
* Poor low-speed manoeuvrability - accurate low-speed usage of rockets against ground targets is difficult.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
