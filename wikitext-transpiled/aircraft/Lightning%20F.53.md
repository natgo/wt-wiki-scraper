== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
[[File:Royal Saudi Air Force Lightning.jpg|thumb|RSAF Lightning F.53 (Tail #227), the same Lightning F.53 modelled in-game, as a gate guard at King Faisal Airbase.|left]]
During the late '60s, when the Lightning was no longer considered "cutting edge" and the RAF was in the process of acquiring [[Phantom FGR.2|F-4 Phantoms]], the MoD greenlit the export of the Lightning to close Middle Eastern allies, namely Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The export variants were divided into two types, the Lightning F.52 being ex-RAF [[Lightning F.6]] converted for export, and F.53 being newly built specialized ground-attack export models of the F.6, with more hardpoints for bombs or unguided rocket pods. A total of 46 were built, 12 F.53Ks for the Kuwaiti Air Force and 34 F.53s for the Royal Saudi Arabian Air Force, with one aircraft crashing during shakedown tests before delivery, resulting in a hasty replacement F.53 being rebuilt from an old F.6 airframe to meet the delivery time. Saudi Arabia received their first F.53 in 1967, and would extensively use them until 1986 when the Saudis started trying to acquire the Tornado IDS to replace it, which they successfully completed in 1989 with the first [[Tornado (Family)|Tornado IDS]] deliveries in that same year.

Introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]] as a [[wt:en/news/7741-development-new-premium-jets-lightning-f-53-and-ariete-en|premium pack]], Lightning F.53 is a more ground-attack oriented version of the Lightning F.6 in the tech tree, and as such, is slightly heavier, meaning the already mediocre air-to-air performance at that BR of the Lightning is now slightly worse. The F.53 shines in frontline high speed ground attack runs thanks to its insanely large amount of unguided rockets (up to 192) across underwing pods, overwing pods, and an internal rocket bay. The F.53 is indeed a unique and peculiar aircraft which does not particularly excel at many things, and acts best as a collector aircraft for people interested in the rich history of Middle Eastern military aviation.

The Lightning F.53 was removed from the Gaijin store after the [[wt:en/news/8046-shop-war-thunder-winter-sale-en|2022 "Winter sale"]]. It was briefly made available for purchase with Golden Eagles {{ge}} for the [[wt:en/news/8389-special-incredibly-fast-lightning-jet-fighter-temporarily-available-for-ge-en|2023 anniversary of its first flight]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Lightning F.53 has an identical internal layout to the [[Lightning F.6]] upon which it is based. This means that most of the area in the wings is full of fuel tanks; likewise the stacked and staggered engines are retained. While the top engine is exposed and vulnerable to enemy attacks it can often absorb bullets, protecting the lower engine from damage (assuming the enemy is attacking you from the rear and above).

Where the Lightning F.53 does differ from the Lightning F.6 is in the addition of a 64 mm bulletproof glass windscreen. This is the only armour found on either aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Lightning F.53 is not unique for its battle-rating, if you've played the F-104, you may find it very similar. However, the Lightning F.53 gets load-outs for ground targets that should not be ignored. It can carry enough payload to destroy entire convoys or bases while still carrying its two anti-air missiles.

When it comes to engaging air targets, a boom-and-zoom approach is most suited, the Lightning F.53 can turn quite well when flying just under Mach, however, it is much easier for the Lightning to outrun missiles than to try out-turning them. The 2 Red Top missiles are capable but must be used with care, their range is very limited at the speeds the Lightning F.53 tends to face, at the BR's top speeds, their effective launch range is within 2.5km from the sides and 1.5km from the rear.
Targets should be carefully considered as well, many aircraft at the BR have flares, one of the main distinctions that need to be made is between the F-104A and F-104C, both at the same BR, the A does not get flares while the C does. Another recurring aircraft is the A-10A, while it is an optimal target for the Lightning F.53's guns as it is slow and will have trouble manoeuvring out of the line of fire, caution must still be in order as it possesses extremely potent all-aspect missiles. The Su-25 should be handled with the same amount of caution, the Lightning F.53 generally cannot outmanoeuver those missiles.

The Lightning F.53 comes with a radar, locking on with the radar may seem pointless as it does not possess radar-guided missiles, however, the radar lock facilitates the missile lock even if it is not outright guiding them, so it is a good habit to radar-lock air targets you are be going after.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good climb rate and acceleration.
* Formidable angle-of-attack above low speeds.
* Very powerful cannons, and good missiles.
* Surprisingly good turn rate between 800 and 1,000 km/h IAS.
* Large rocket payload.

'''Cons:'''

* Quite poor energy retention.
* Large target for enemy aircraft.
* Awkward under-belly cannon placement.
* Relatively low top speed (1,280 km/h IAS at sea level).
* Poor low-speed manoeuvrability - accurate low-speed usage of rockets against ground targets is difficult.
