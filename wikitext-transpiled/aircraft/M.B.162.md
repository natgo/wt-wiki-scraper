== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Bloch M.B.162 is the best indigenously-designed bomber France has at its disposal, behaving similarly to the American [[B-17 (Family)|B-17]]. It is deceptively quick for a strategic bomber, and has an excellent climb rate that allows it to get to its safe altitude quickly. However, its excellent performance does not mean that it is lacking in bomb load or defensive armaments as one might expect. Although having a lower total capacity than the earlier [[N.C.223.3]], it has a higher bomb load than any other indigenous French bomber and a defensive armament that matches the previously mentioned 223. All-in-all, the 162 can be seen as a sort of "Best of Both Worlds" of the French bomber tree, combining the excellent speed, climb rate and manoeuvrability of the lighter twin engined bombers with the bomb load and defensive armament of the heavy bombers.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* No armour plating
* Six total self-sealing fuel tanks located in wings

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|No.1 (100 kg)|No.1 (200 kg)|No.2 (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 6 x 200 kg No.1 bombs + 6 x 100 kg No.1 bombs (1,800 kg total)
* 4 x 500 kg No.2 bombs (2,000 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, dorsal turret (120 rpg)
* 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, ventral turret (120 rpg)
* 1 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (500 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The M.B.162 is a heavy bomber, and therefore should be flown as such. When you start a match, you will want to climb to 6-7 km in altitude to protect yourself from German and Italian fighters that will climb to intercept you. With both of the payload options, all bombs are needed to destroy a bombing base. It is worthy to note that the M.B.162 can be significantly more aggressive in Arcade, where its already excellent performance is boosted to further levels.

However, being a bomber, fighters will go out of their way to take you down (sometimes even at the expense of their own aircraft). Although the Hispanos are relatively inaccurate when fired in long bursts, they can be very devastating when fired in .5 second bursts at an aircraft's cockpit. But it is also to note that if you can hit an enemy with your turrets, they can hit you with their guns as well, which can be a large problem when fighting the multi-cannon armed Fw 190, Bf 109, C.202EC/C.205 and G.55 fighters that all mount the universally feared [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151]] that has access to the dreaded Minengeschoß round.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful Hispano 404 cannons in dorsal and ventral turrets
* Effective bomb payload
* Respectable speed for a heavy bomber
* Excellent climb rate

'''Cons:'''

* Turrets cannot turn 360 degrees
* HS.404 cannons have low ammunition count
* No turrets protecting the front, perpendicular sides, or directly vertical
* Only 2 payload options, and both can only destroy 1 base

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The M.B.162 was derived from the original civilian airliner Bloch M.B. 160 already in service and was built as mail plane by the Société des Avions Marcel Bloch. '''Société des Avions Marcel Bloch''' was a French aircraft manufacturer of both military and civilian aircraft which changed its name to Dassault Aviation after the end of World War II. The company was originally founded by Marcel Bloch (hence "MB" in the aircraft designations) who, after the war changed his name to Marcel Dassault, the Bloch M.B. 162 shares very few common points with his civilian counterpart, especially concerning its wings<ref name="dassault01" />

The aircraft in-game represents a heavy bomber created by Henri Déplante and Lucien Servanty in order to satisfy the A20 program concerning a category B5 bomber, which had a crew of 5 persons utilised for both day and night bombing. Three M.B.162s were ordered into production in 1937.

Unfortunately, the first flight of the M.B.162 wasn't until the 1st of June 1940 <ref name="dassault01" /> and it never saw combat during the Battle of France (10 May to 25 June 1940). With the fall of France, the prototype of the M.B.162 fell into the Luftwaffe's hands and was used as transport aircraft for the rest of the war. After the war, the aircraft was returned to the French who utilised it in the Armée de l'Air and became the origin of the SNCASE Languedoc (post-war airliner, used for hypersonic experimentations).

Two versions of this plane existed: the MB.162.01 (prototype, one built) and the MB.162 Bn.5 (Production model, never produced).
