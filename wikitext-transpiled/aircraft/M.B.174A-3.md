== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]].

The M.B.174 is a fast bomber made for ground attack. Like a twin-engine strike aircraft, it is able to drop bombs with high accuracy in a ground attack role and use its speed to get away from any return fire.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.''-->
The M.B.174A-3 is rather manoeuvrable flying in a straight line since the aircraft can roll pretty well and has acceptable elevator motion. When in a combat situation, this changes considerably as the plane is difficult to handle in dives and turns. Trying to approach a bombing target in a diving turn, the M.B.174 is very slow to turn around and the bow keeps pointing way off the line of flight. Even using full rudder control, the bow of the plane just does not follow the turn, making it likely that the bombs will miss their target. In addition, the M.B.174 does not conserve energy well and trying to climb will reduce speed to under 200 km/h, in which case the pilot can expect to be an easy score for any enemy.

But like all aircraft at this BR, the best solution for air combat is not getting caught in the first place. The M.B.174 however can run away better than its peers because it is blazing fast; it easily outruns all but the fastest fighters and any strike aircraft trying to intercept you bites the dust in a chase. The speed is definitely something which the M.B.174 has over other single-engined strike aircraft, as it has two 1,073 HP engines which easily outpower anything at the BR it is in.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm Steel plate behind the pilot's head.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
The stock configuration gives you largely ineffective 50 kg bombs, so researching the 500 kg bomb is imperative to the plane's success.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

The two machine guns are arranged with one mounted in each wing. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire with each other until empty. The problem with using your frontal armament is that you will have a hard time lining up on your target considering the sluggish turn time and the rapid energy bleeding which comes with moving your plane in ways it was never designed for: hitting anything with your two rifle-calibre MGs is also hard because the guns are mounted on the wings, very far away from the centre of the aircraft, making gun convergence a huge factor in aiming.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|G.A. MMN. 50 (50 kg)|No.2 (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 8 x 50 kg G.A. MMN. 50 bombs (400 kg total)
* 1 x 500 kg No.2 bomb (500 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 2 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, dorsal turret (400 rpg = 800 total)
* 3 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, ventral turret (500 rpg = 1,500 total)

The defensive armament of two MGs on the back of the cockpit does not amount to much, although if you can move your plane into directly lining up with the enemy on your six you can unleash the three bottom-mounted MGs too which might suffice in taking down the pursuer.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

With its heaviest and most effective bombload being a single 500 kg bomb held by bomb locks, the M.B.174 can effectively dive bomb. The recommended strategy is basically to dive on targets to secure a kill with a low number of high-weight bombs; a playstyle similar to the [[Ju 87 B-2]] or the [[TBF-1C]]. The only limitation to this strategy is that you cannot drop bombs while making a diving turn due to your twin-engine configuration. However, considering those engines provide you with a near-unmatched speed this is a worthwhile tradeoff. 

Tactics should be focused on bombing ground targets with a straight line approach and a clear exit away from the enemy. The 50 kg bombs are not effective against any ground target. In attack mode, the 7.5 mm MG don't make much of a dent on enemies, and since ammo runs out quickly, any attack must be carefully planned. Attacking bombers at higher altitude is not advisable. Fighters busy in turn fights can be attacked if you have an altitude advantage and a line of exit. After bombing the target, by turning away from the enemy and descending at the same time you will probably be able either to outrun or keep up with most of the enemy fighters at this BR.

In conclusion; the M.B.174 is a twin-engine strike aircraft disguised as a bomber, with a superb speed and reasonable manoeuvrability. It however lacks sufficient defensive armament and the frontal armament is only effective against unaware open-topped vehicles. The bomb load is comparable to other strike aircraft of the BR, though the stock loadout is largely ineffective. All things considered it is definitely a good plane to have in your ground RB lineup, considering it can drop the 500 kg bomb pretty precisely and evade any AA or pursuers after securing a kill. In air battles, the plane is largely overshadowed in the bomber role by the [[N.C.223.3]] and in the twin-engine strike role by the [[Potez 631]].

'''Pros:'''

* Superb speed for a bomber
* Extremely maneuvreable for a bomber
* Has offensive armament which despite its weakness makes it relatively unique to other bombers
* Can drop a very forgiving bomb with high precision in a ground attack role

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely weak stock payload
* Poor defensive armament
* Has little purpose in air battles

== History ==

Evolution of the MB.170, this new model definitively abandoned the belly turret and the crew's typical layout was revised. The cockpit and front-end glazing were again modified, however, the MB.170-02's tail was retained. Intended specifically for reconnaissance with a secondary bombing mission, the prototype took the air on 5 January 1939 in Villacoublay piloted by René Le Bail with 14M-20/21 Gnome & Rhône engines of 1,030 hp. Six pre-production aircraft were ordered to activate the development of the twin-engine aircraft, but this aircraft proved to be very fast and easy to fly from the first tests, manoeuvrable even at very high altitude and an order for 50 serial copies was notified on 1 February 1939. Intended to replace the Potez 63.11 of the war, they were to receive 14M-48/49 Gnome & Rhône engines of 1,100 hp, but the first tests carried out with the pre-series aircraft revealed cooling problems. It was, therefore, necessary to reduce the diameter of the propeller pans in order to increase the airflow on the cylinder heads. Finally, just before the commissioning it was decided to increase the armament, which was finally attached to two 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns in the wings and three mounted in removable ventral fairings pulling forward, a dorsal machine gun and a ventral weapon of the same type pulling backwards. The belly compartment allowed 400 kg of bombs to be carried, but in its initial version, its capacity was in fact limited to 8 x 40 kg bombs which was clearly insufficient in most operations. The production was launched in November 1939 at the SNCASO plant in Bordeaux-Mérignac, but because of the modifications made to the planes during their development the first 20 MB.174 were accepted by the air force only in February 1940 and put into service in March 1940 to the strategic reconnaissance group GR II/33. 56 copies were delivered until June 22, 1940. In operations, this twin-engine aircraft was able to outrun the best German fighters then in service and only 4 MB.174 were lost to the enemy during the Battle of France.

During Battle of France on May 1940, the famous French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery flew a Bloch M. B 174 with the Groupe de reconnaissance II/33 in a squadron of Armée de l'Air. On 23rd May of 1940, he made a recon mission above the city of Arras during the German invasion and his plane was heavily damaged by Flak and attacked by fighters however he managed to get back at his airfield and save his crew. Due to this heroic action, he was awarded of Croix de Guerre (Iron Cross) on 2nd June 1940. This mission inspired him a book named Pilote de Guerre. (Flight to Arras)
