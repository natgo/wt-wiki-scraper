== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]].

Although called a "bomber", with its hard-hitting armament of two 20mm [[MG 151/20 (20 mm)|MG 151/20]] cannons, this plane should be used in a more aggressive role as an attacker, or even a bomber interceptor. The HVAR rockets and the MG 151/20s make it a perfect counter to the much-feared [[BV 238]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!--''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.''-->

* 10 mm steel plate: pilot headset
* Self-sealing fuel tanks: inner & middle wings

* 1 x 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon, dorsal turret (250 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in an aircraft, the features of using vehicles in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!--Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".-->

'''Pros:'''

* Has air brakes 
* Quite manoeuvrable for its size
* 12 x HVAR rockets as basic payload
* Armed with two powerful 20 mm MG 151 with a large ammo pool for each
* One 20 mm MG 151/20 defensive turret to easily deal with enemies in its shooting range

'''Cons:'''

* MG 151/20 is mounted in the wings far off the fuselage, requires adjustment of convergence for accurate hits on enemy
* Turret is only good for enemies above the aircraft; large blindside due to plane's twin rudders
* Flaps have a rather low speed limit before they tear off
* Gunner is exposed
* Does not have a ventral gunner, making it vulnerable to attacks from under

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/ History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
