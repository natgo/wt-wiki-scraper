== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Barougan (“battle” in Arabic),  was a very minor off-shoot of the M.D.450B Ouragan. The main difference was the new gear design that would allow the Barougan to take off from undeveloped runways. The nose gear stayed the same; however, the main gear in the center of the aircraft was very different. The Barougan had four wheels in the center to help absorb the load from grass runways and it proved to be a good design. A tail parachute was also added to decrease the landing distance and make it more viable. Unfortunately for the Barougan, the program was cut short due to budget constraints and was reconverted back to its original configuration. 

Introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a decent early jet fighter. It has four chin-mounted 20 mm cannons and access to bombs as well as SNEB type 23 rockets. Although it has four cannons, the ammo belts are less than desirable and greatly hinder the effectiveness of the guns. The Rolls-Royce engine is decent; although if players choose higher fuel settings, the Barougan will greatly struggle with accelerating quickly and overall energy retention will diminish. Overall, the Barougan is a decent aircraft for players progressing through the French tech tree and serves as a good indicator of upcoming native French jets.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 40 mm Bulletproof glass in front of pilot.
* 13.5 mm Steel plate in the nose.
* 13.5 mm Steel plates behind pilot.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M50 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm M50 cannons, chin-mounted (125 rpg = 500 total)

The four 20mm cannons are clustered on the underside of the fuselage, directly below the pilot. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire with each other until empty. An advantage of this chin mounted arrangement is that gun convergence does not play a factor unlike wing-mounted guns.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)|SNEB type 23|T10 140|T10 151}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (1,000 lb total)
* 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (2,000 lb total)
* 16 x T10 140 rockets
* 16 x T10 151 rockets
* 38 x SNEB type 23 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has stronger landing gear than the Ouragan
* Has a drogue chute for stopping quicker

'''Cons:'''

* Worse than average roll rate

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The prevalence of makeshift airfields created a need for jet aircraft that could comfortably take off and land on them. The Ouragan, which was relegated to properly developed runways, was selected by Dassault to pursue this need. Serial number 140 was selected to experiment with the use of a new gear that would be able to meet this requirement. Instead of the normal three-wheel landing gear, the plane was fitted with a normal nose gear and four “low pressure” wheels in the center. A tail parachute was also fitted to help reduce the landing distance. The Barougan as it would be called (which stands for battle in Arabic), was able to take off from grass airfields and was a decent competitor to SNCASE’s Barouder. Unfortunately, budget cuts ended the program and the Barougan was reconverted back to its normal Ouragan configuration.
