== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
With tensions rising in the Arab world, Israel was looking for a new, advanced fighter. After multiple failed deals with the F-86 and F-84, France took the initiative to sell their jets. At first, Israel was set on receiving the new Mystere IV and Mystere II but testing revealed numerous issues with the Mysteres. They were to be grounded until the problems were remedied. As a stop-gap measure, France sent 12 M.D.450 Ouragans to Israel. Although Israel soon received the Mystere IV, they still continued to successfully use the Ouragan as a support fighter and ground striker. Ouragans served well into the 1970s until they were replaced by more superior aircraft; some being sold to El Salvador. 

Introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a fairly versatile fighter. The Ouragan has average performance. With a top speed of only 942 km/h (585 mph) and decent acceleration, it struggles to outrun and catch up to enemy fighters. It also has a structural speed limit of 1,030 km/h (640 mph) which is sufficient for jet battles but players should be wary of initiating aggressive dives. The Ouragan can also turn quite well thanks to its wing design and has good manoeuvring energy retention.  As for ground ordnance, the Ouragan can carry rockets and a variety of bombs. Overall, the M.D.450B Ouragan is a capable fighter and ground striker in many aspects.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 40 mm Bulletproof glass - Front Windshield
* 13.5 mm Steel - Nose armor
* 13.5 mm Steel - Upper seat rest
* 13.5 mm Steel - Rear of pilot's seat

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M50 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm M50 cannons, nose-mounted (125 rpg = 500 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)|Mk.2 incendiary|T10 140|T10 151}}

The key distinction between the '''{{Specs|name}}''' and the M.D.450B Ouragan for France, is that the Israeli modification introduces two additional default ordinance configurations: one with the "2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs paired with 8 x T10 140 rockets' and the other being the '2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs paired with 8 x T10 151 rockets.'

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (1,000 lb total)
* 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (2,000 lb total)
* 16 x T10 140 rockets
* 16 x T10 151 rockets
* 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs + 8 x T10 140 rockets (1,000 lb total)
* 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs + 8 x T10 151 rockets (1,000 lb total)
* 2 x Mk.2 incendiary bombs

During the mid-1950s, Israel was keen to procure new fighter jets as tensions were rising between Israel's Arab neighbors. Israel looked at multiple jets such as the F-86 and F-84 but those deals fell through due to Arab involvement. France was the only country willing to sell jets to Israel, so Israel made a deal with France to acquire multiple Mystere IIs and 15 Mystere IVAs in July of 1954. However, this deal fell through due to performance issues with the Mystere II and problems with the Mystere IVA delayed transfers to the IAF. Israel acquired 12 M.D. 450 Ouragans as a stop-gap until the Mystere IVA was ready.

The Mystere IVA was sent to Israel in April of 1956 and replaced the Ouragan as a first-line fighter. This didn't stop the use of Ouragans during the Suez Crisis where the Ouragan acquired its first air kill against a Vampire and was used as a ground striker. The Ouragan proved to be a formidable ground striker due to its capable loadout of bombs and rockets. In one instance, the Egyptian destroyer, Ibrahim el Awal, sailed undetected to Israel's only seaport and began shelling the city of Haifa. 2 M.D. 450s were dispatched and they successfully disabled the ship, forcing its surrender. After the war, Israel obtained more Ouragans and continued using them as a ground attacker up until 1970 when the Ouragans were transferred for pilot training. In 1973, the Ouragans were phased out of service with 18 Ouragans being sold to the El Salvadorian Air Force. 

The M.D. 450 Ouragan proved to be a very good asset in Israeli hands with multiple air-to-air kills, even downing a MiG-21, and very proficient in ground strikes. A high-ranking IAF official later said, "The Ouragan was a much better aeroplane than had been thought."
