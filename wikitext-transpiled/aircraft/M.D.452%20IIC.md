== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 "Advancing Storm"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The MD.452 IIC is something of a jack of all trades. Its flight performance is balanced, if a bit slow to accelerate. The roll rate is excellent at medium to high speeds (550 - 900 km/h), giving the aircraft many options for evasive manoeuvres, and although energy-bleeding, the turn rate is good against most enemies. The two fast-firing 30 mm DEFA canons also compose tremendous firepower, if used with suitable ammunition.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 40 mm Bulletproof glass in front of the pilot
* 13.5 mm Steel plate around the bottom of the cockpit, front and rear
* 13.5 mm Steel plate behind the pilot

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|DEFA 541 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm DEFA 541 cannons, belly-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)

The two cannons are arranged in the belly portion of the fuselage exiting the aircraft just behind the pilot's location. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that both guns will fire together until empty.

This aircraft is the first of the French jets to use 30 mm DEFA canons, which are (as of Update 1.95) the best 30 mm guns in the game, with the highest shell velocity, rate of fire, and gun reliability. While the default ammunition is underwhelming, the "air targets" ammunition will shred enemy fighters with a single or a couple of shells. Heavier targets might need 3-5 hits to lose a wing.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 Fin M129 (1,000 lb)|SNEB type 23}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (1,000 lb total)
* 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 Fin M129 bombs (2,000 lb total)
* 38 x SNEB type 23 rockets

The ordnance of the {{PAGENAME}} gives it the ability to engage ground targets, but limits its manoeuvrability greatly and should generally not be used in Air RB except as a late game last resort. In mixed battles, the SNEB rockets can be an excellent anti-tank weapon for CAS, and the aircraft inserts well in the French BR 8.3 line-up.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} is generally more manoeuvrable than most other contemporary aircraft it faces, the only ones you would have a tough time turning with at this battle rating would be any of the Sabres. Since its roll rate is comparable to the Sabre's once the "New Boosters" modification is installed, the option of turnfighting becomes available, although speed will be bled at a relatively high rate. Still, like the predecessors of the Mystère II, boom & zooming should remain the first choice in engagements. Control stiffening doesn't appear under around 1,000-1,050 km/h, and devastating armament will take out an enemy target in a single pass. Furthermore, top speed in level flight is slightly below average, justifying even more that tactic.

Overall, the Mystère IIC should be considered as buffed Ouragan/Barougan, increasing drastically the top speed, armament, and manoeuvrability parameters.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent armament of 2 x 30 mm DEFA cannons (higher muzzle velocity and RoF than the ADEN cannon)
* High roll rate, matches the Sabre's roll rate with "New boosters" modification installed
* Good turn rate between 550 km/h and 800 km/h
* Decent climb rate
* Payloads can include bombs or rockets
* More effective air brake than its predecessors
* A lot of ammo for only 2 x 30 mm DEFA cannons
* Guns being mounted under the nose makes it easy to head on planes upside down
* DEFA cannons can easily down a plane with 1 to 3 HE rounds striking

'''Cons:'''

* Slightly slower to other contemporary aircraft
* Poor horizontal energy retention compared to its predecessors
* Fragile; a few hits of enemy fire will make controlling the aircraft more difficult, forcing a return to base for repairs

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

[[File:M.D.452 'Mystere'.jpg|thumb]]
The M.D.452 Mystère was a swept-wing air superiority fighter developed by Dassault Aviation, derived from the M.D.450 Ouragan. The aircraft combined the fuselage of the Ouragan with a new swept-wing, enabling it to reach much faster speeds than its predecessor. In 1951, the Mystère IIA became the first French-designed plane to break the sound barrier, in a controlled dive.<ref name=":0">http://www.airvectors.net/avmyst.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210428191744/http://www.airvectors.net/avmyst.html Archive])</ref> Later on, the M.D.452 IIC would enter service with the French Air force, and serve until 1957, when it was relegated to training duties.<ref name=":1">https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/md-452-mystere-ii/# ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210504192518/https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/md-452-mystere-ii/ Archive])</ref>

====== Design and Development ======
The M.D.452 Mystère was originally designed as an advanced variant of the preceding M.D.450 Ouragan, with a new wing section and engine. In 1950, Marcel Dassault, the head of the Dassault aviation firm, signed a contract to produce an M.D.450 Ouragan with a new thinner wing section.<ref name=":1" /> The aircraft had a wing swept back at 30 degrees compared to the Ouragan's 14 degrees, and was powered by a license-built version of the Rolls-Royce Nene. During tests, the aircraft showed significantly better climb rate and top speed, being capable of reaching transonic speeds. After four prototypes, the M.D.452 IIA was developed, carrying four 20 mm M50 (Hispano-derived) cannons and the Rolls-Royce Tay engine. On October 28th 1951, a Mystère IIA Became the first French aircraft to break the sound barrier, in a controlled dive.<ref name=":0" />

However, the M.D.452 IIA failed to enter service, as it was rapidly replaced by the M.D.452 IIB and IIC. The IIB and IIC retained the wing and fuselage of the IIA, while featuring a new intake design and a pair of 30 mm DEFA cannons in place of the IIA's four M50s.<ref name=":0" /> The new IIC was re-engined with a SNECMA Atar turbojet, capable of producing 25 kN of thrust. The M.D.452 IIC would later go on to enter service, serving between 1954 and 1963.

====== Operational Service ======
In 1954, the French Air service placed an order for 150 M.D.452 IIC aircraft, which were delivered between 1954 and 1957.<ref name=":1" /> These aircraft carried a SNECMA Atar 101-D (producing 29 kN thrust),<ref>https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/md-452/ ([https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/md-452/ Archive])</ref> but were otherwise identical to the IIC prototypes. In total, 171 Dassault Mystères were built, including prototypes of the IIA, IIB and IIC variants. By the time of the last deliveries, the aircraft was already being relegated to advanced training duties; the rapid pace of aviation technology during the 1950s led to the aircraft rapidly becoming obsolete.<ref name=":0" /> The last M.D. 452 IIC was retired from training duties in 1963, after 9 years of service with the French Air Force.
