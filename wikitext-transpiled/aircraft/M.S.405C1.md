== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]]. A pre-production version of the [[M.S.406C1]], the M.S.405C1 is very similar to the succeeding aircraft.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- No armour plating
- No armour glazing
- Critical components located at front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, nose-mounted (60 rpg)
- 2 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, wing-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The M.S.405C1 is a respectable low rank monoplane that primarily suffers from a low ammo count for its armament, with only 60 rounds for its nose mounted 20 mm cannon and 300 rounds per gun for its two wing mounted rifle-calibre machine guns. This means that while it is a good turner, players flying the M.S.405C1 should engage in turn fights in arcade battles sparingly and with allies nearby, as it will need to disengage frequently to reload. Stick to high altitudes and prey on bombers or dive on unsuspecting fighters, especially reserve aircraft and biplanes which are a common sight at this BR and offer little resistance against the Hispano 404 cannon.

Players flying the M.S.405C1 should be on the lookout for and take care in engaging faster monoplanes such as the [[Bf 109 E-1]], which can handily out-climb the M.S.405C1 and also has significantly higher ammo capacities for its guns.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Can fight against reserve planes, which are easy pickings for its nose mounted cannon
- Provides players with good first experience for the M.S. line
- Virtually identical to the succeeding M.S.406C1 for an easy transition
- Very sturdy structure, can sustain 700 km/h IAS in a dive
- Good turn fighter among monoplanes at its rank

'''Cons:'''

- Both the cannon and the 7.5 mm machine guns have very low ammo count
- The wing mounted 7.5 mm machine guns are lousy once the cannon is depleted
- No armour or self-sealing fuel tanks
- No combat flaps, only landing flaps

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==

<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
