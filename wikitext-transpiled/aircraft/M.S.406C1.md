== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]].

The MS.406C1 is a good general fighter for newer players (though, experienced pilots should not discount this aircraft). This aircraft has a good climb-rate, is manoeuvrable and retains energy allowing for repeated dive and climb situations. This aircraft performs its fighter role, but with having a [[Hispano 404 (20 mm)|Hispano 404]] cannon installed, it can also take on the role of a bomber-hunter or soft-ground target attacker.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* No armour plating
* No armour glazing
* Critical components located at front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, nose-mounted (60 rpg)
* 2 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, wing-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

The Hispano 404 is nose-mounted, firing out of the prop spinner while the two MAC 1934 are wing-mounted. If fired at the same time, the cannon will run out of ammunition before the machine guns will.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MS.406C1 retains its energy well and is best utilized for energy fighting or Boom & Zoom situations. This aircraft can be used for head-on attacks using its cannon, however, be careful as the MS.406C1 does not have any armour protection.  It will be best to get a few bursts off at range and then manoeuvre out of the head-on. When using this aircraft in a bomber-hunter role, it is best to avoid flying towards the rear or sides of this aircraft as typically this is where most of the bomber's defensive weapons are pointed.  It is best to come at the front of the bomber from either below or from above (make sure you have energy as if you are near stall speed, you will be an easy target for gunners) and make strafing shots and wait until you are out of gunner range to turn and attempt a second pass.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Retains energy well
* 20 mm [[Hispano 404 (20 mm)|Hispano 404]] cannon
* Decent turn time, can almost catch its smoke trail without flaps
* Small target

'''Cons:'''

* Low ammo for both MG and cannon
* Controls lock up in high-speed dives above 480 km/h (300 mph)
* Only two flap positions, up and landing
* Prone to catching fire
* Difficult to do severe damage when autocannon is out of ammunition or reloading

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The first modern fighter of WW2 France, and their most famous combat plane. A first-class aircraft, it was only inferior in performance in French pre-war service to the D.520. A total of 1,081 were built, more than any other French plane except the Potez 63. The prototype (the in-game M.S. 405) first flew in August 1935, becoming the first French fighter to break the 400 km/h limit. In 1937, it was advertised at the Brussels Air Show as "the best fighter plane in the world." The fourth prototype would be taken into production as the M.S. 406, with 600 aircraft in 12 units at the start of the war, having been taken into operational service in December 1938. During the war, the M.S. 406 proved a fair match for the German Bf. 109: 150 M.S. 406s were shot down in the Battle for France, against 191 confirmed and 89 probable kills by the same make of aircraft. Another hundred were destroyed on the ground. Finland also purchased 40 before the war.
