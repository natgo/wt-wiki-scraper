== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''M.S.410''' was meant to be an upgrade over the M.S.406 after its introduction in 1939. The engineers included a new wing design, improved offensive armament and a new fixed radiator, among other minor upgrades. The changes were minor and the plane was not much different compared to its predecessor, the aircraft never managed to be used by the French Air Force since its production started just before France's capitulation in June 1940. The aircraft was however, was produced in limited numbers under German supervision in Vichy France, also a few M.S.406 airframes were converted to the 410.

Introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]], the {{Specs|name}} behaves like many other French aircraft of its rank and BR, it has a relatively mediocre armament and good agility at the cost of top speed and durability. The M.S.410 has an acceptable climb rate that should be used to maintain initiative and energy fight slower opponents, since many fighters, specially German and American fighters will be able to outrun you. Due to its armament, the {{Specs|name}} is not well suited to pursuing bombers, instead, try saving the ammo of your 20 mm cannon for fighters and critical shots.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 6 mm Steel plates behind the pilot's head.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, nose-mounted (60 rpg)
* 4 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 2,000 total)

The four machine guns are arranged in bundles of two mounted in each wing. Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty. The Hispano 404 cannon is nose-mounted, terminating at the prop spinner.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The M.S.410 is a respectably balanced fighter, able to both turn and energy fight with reasonable performance in both roles. The typical French combo of 7.5 mm MGs and 20 mm Hispano cannon though the spinner allows you to take on even the toughest of targets at your rank with little issue in landing hard-hitting knock-outs.

Some aircraft will be able to outrun you, such as the early German air superiority fighters, and others like the Japanese will be able to outturn you, but very few planes will be able to do both. Use this to your advantage to gain the upper hand in the furball.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Effective dive speed
* Decent ammo count in armaments
* Acceptable flat line speed

'''Cons:'''

* Low amount of cannon rounds (60 rpg)
* Low energy retention
* Terrible low speed control
* Extremely difficult to extinguish on-plane fires

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
As the M.S.406 began entering squadron service in 1939, engineers at Morane-Saulnier continued working on the design, aiming to improve it. Several changes were made to the base design, which included the replacement of the old wing design with a new one, increased and improved offensive capabilities and the replacement of the old retractable radiator with a fixed one, among others. The applied changes resulted in the new M.S.410 being able to achieve somewhat better performance than its predecessor, namely reaching a slightly higher top speed. Right after the M.S.410 entered production, France capitulated in June 1940, halting the production of the aircraft after the fifth machine was constructed.

Production of the M.S.410 was temporarily halted after the German occupation, but resumed shortly after under German supervision. Before France's capitulation, an order for 500 M.S.410s was placed. Needless to say, this production quota was never met, even under German supervision. In the end, only around 70 examples of the M.S.410 were manufactured, most of which consisted of M.S.406 airframes being converted to the 410 standard. Even then, a large number of these machines were only partially upgraded to the 410 standard, leaving many examples as hybrid models.
