== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.57 "Battle March"]] as a reward vehicle for the [[wt:en/news/3681-special-event-series-chronicles-of-world-war-ii-day-28-faq-added-en|2016 "Chronicles of World War II"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The MBR-2 has surprisingly good survivability taking into account that it has no armour protection. Its main weak point is the engine, it is very exposed and prone to taking hits - something to be expected for a top-mounted engine. But if you don't sustain critical damage to the engine or catch fire, the sturdy fuselage and wings often tank out most light machine gun fire which it faces.

Landings are also of course a risk for the MBR. For landings on solid ground it is recommended to lower your speed to under 200 km/h, that way you don't damage the fuselage and have less of a risk of ripping your wing or wing pontoons. Same applies for water landings which are substantially better for the plane since it's what it's designed for.

In short your engine is vulnerable, fires usually burn through your wooden fuselage and landings should be done at slow speeds.

{{main|FAB-50sv (50 kg)|FAB-100sv (100 kg)|FAB-250sv (250 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 8 x 50 kg FAB-50 bombs (400 kg total)
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100 bombs + 6 x 50 kg FAB-50 bombs (500 kg total)
* 4 x 100 kg FAB-100 bombs (400 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg FAB-250M43 bombs (500 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun, nose turret (1,000 rpg)
* 1 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun, dorsal turret (1,500 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Surprisingly manoeuvrable, especially with its combat flaps
* Ability to land on water (Rivers, lakes, oceans and so on.)
* Purchasable winter camo helps to hide in snowy maps
* Decent amount of ammunition for gunners
* Thanks to sturdy construction the plane is quite forgiving when landing

'''Cons:'''

* No armour protection for crew or critical components
* Large unprotected non-self sealing fuel tanks
* Large exposed top mounted engine
* Engine limits the targeting angles of the gunners

* Very vulnerable from attacks coming from below

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The MBR-2 was a Soviet multi-purpose (including reconnaissance) flying boat. It entered service in the Soviet Navy in 1935 and 1,365 were built, in 6 versions. Some were used by foreign countries, including Finland and North Korea. In the Soviet Union, it sometimes carried the nickname of "Kорова" (cow) and "Амбар" (barn). After the Second World war, the plane was used to watch over fishing areas.

It saw extensive service during the Soviet-Finnish winter war between 1939 and 1940, and against Germany from June 1941. It demonstrated reliability and robustness throughout these conflicts. Several MBR-2s returned safely to missions after receiving enemy fire. The MBR-2 was able to be equipped with wheels or skis, thus adapting to many areas of operation. Faced with the shortage of aircraft in flight, its armament was adopted in June 1941 by the Soviet authorities to carry out night bombardments, then diurnal. It's very slow speed made it very useful for submarine hunting.

The in-game MBR-2 is the MBR-2bis (also known as MBR-2AM-34). It was developed in 1935 as an improved version, powered by the Mikulin AM-34N engine, and fitted with an enclosed cockpit, a dorsal gun-turret and enlarged vertical tail. The machine remained in production until 1941 with this configuration.
