== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
'''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian fighter {{Battle-rating}}. The CN is Italian for Caccia Notturno or Night Fighter, hence the black paint job.  Though a [[Marcolin's C.R.42 CN (Germany)|version]] existed in the German tech tree as a premium vehicle and is still available to those who unlocked it, it was moved to the Italian tech tree as a gift vehicle in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]]. The plane is painted after the camouflage scheme of Italian pilot Luciano Marcolin, the commanding officer of the 377<sup>a</sup> Squadriglia Autonoma dedicated in a night fighting role.

The C.R.42 is a rank I biplane fighter. It possesses exceptional manoeuvrability, speed, and durability, especially for a biplane. Its armament is quite good as well, due to the Breda-SAFAT .50 calibre MGs. Due to its battle rating, the C.R.42 gets thrown in with the likes of [[P-36A|P-36]]s and [[LaGG-3-8|LaGG-3]]s. As such, the majority of aircraft the C.R.42 will engage are faster, and more heavily armed. The best bet for survival, and downing enemy targets, is to climb to about medium altitude, and lure fighters into turning combat. The overwhelming majority of pilots are unwilling to run from a lowly biplane, allowing you to score critical damage before they realize that they have expended all their energy and must extend away from you. By that time, the damage is usually severe enough that they cannot accelerate away from you quickly enough to escape further damage.

Fighting other biplanes is a whole other issue. Being lighter and thusly having lower stall speeds, they initially perform better in tight turns. Yet all is not lost as the hostile (lower rank) biplane will lose speed (and thusly energy) doing so. Here the CR.42 can find its fighting edge. Being slightly more aerodynamic and heavier which fortunately offset by a stronger engine, the CR.42 can either power through the early turns taking a few hits in the process, or perform advanced aerobatic manoeuvres. As such, include a combination of high and low Yo-Yos to abuse the superior energy retention, or a Split-S to gain speed for altitude, hoping that the enemy biplane either reaches terminal speeds (RB and SB only), has their controls locked up, or yourself can run away safely to initiate a new attack. Due to the excellent stall characteristics of many biplanes, Boom and Zoom tactics can quite literally 'back' fire.

For the armament, the same applies to all other Italian aircraft; generally you want to use Tracers, Air targets or stealth since they are the belts that deal the most damage. Shell velocity is low, hence they suffer above 300 m, so only fire at or below that range for best effects. Furthermore, much like the other Italian fighters, the armament is woefully inadequate to deal with bombers, hence it is best to avoid them entirely, or focus on taking out the engines. Only exception are the very early biplane bombers, such as [[Swordfish Mk I|Swordfish]], [[Po-2]] and the like.

As one of the last generation of biplane fighters, the CR.42 incorporates many advantages , but also disadvantages of said built. Notably a low stall speed, predicating it for [[Turn & Burn|turn fights]]. Climb speed is good to great, but cannot compare to many later fighters ([[:Category:Second_rank_aircraft|Rank II]]). Another advantage gained is the relatively high break speeds of ~570 km/h IAS and the late lock up speed of 450 IAS for the elevator. The top speed is good for [[:Category:First_rank_aircraft|Rank I]], but only reached after a short dive and quickly dwindles with damage received.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

Biplanes by design have a lot of surface and consequently have plenty of aircraft to be shot at. This makes them feel more vulnerable than they really are, although again: They are fairly big, hard to miss targets, so the feeling is justified. Even more so as the fabric skin is easily damaged by small arms fire. The change to a aluminium monocoque fuselage design was linked with an increase in armament size for a reason. However, here lies a great advantage: Many explosive triggers and fuses have their detonation sensitivities set to metal skins, not fabric ones, so they may just whizzle through your craft, leaving only two 20 mm sized holes.

The CR.42 in itself features no armour. Only the air cooled rotary engines is rather durable due to lacking any water-cooling and by design.

{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)}}

'''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)

The two machine guns are both mounted on the upper fuselage just in front of the pilot and fire through the propeller arc. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty.

The center lined armament is always a great advantage. However compared to other nations' fighters with their fast firing 7.7 mm machine guns, the Breda's slower rate of fire offsets the gained advantage in calibre size and explosive ammunition (IAI).

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In AB, the C.R.42 is nothing more than a point-and-shoot arcade-style plane. There is little skill involved at these early rank matches. Therefore turning is the most appropriate tactic. However, due to the high climb rate, Boom & Zoom can be effective, as most monoplanes cannot nearly climb as fast.

As in real-life the Falco faces off advanced mono-wing designs. While a grim view at first the C.R.42 is the pinnacle of biplane evolution, only rivalled by the up-gunned [[I-153_M-62|Chaika]] series. Common opponents are faster and have superior armament. However, the C.R.42 has got traits to counter. It is immensely agile, and can easily out-manoeuvre any monoplane in Rank I. Turning is thus an appropriate tactic for the C.R.42. Due to it being a biplane, the Falco can also be used to effectively rope-a-dope enemy aircraft. Stall fighting is one of the strongest play styles, albeit the slowest and hardest to master.

Even Boom & Zoom is feasible, as altitude can be gained quickly; however, the lack of cannon armament forces the pilot to use significant trigger control as well as aiming when diving and attacking opponents at a lower level.
If BnZing, watch your speed in a dive. The C.R.42 does have a limit of around 440 - 480 km/h (274 - 300 mph) before instability sets in.

The Breda SAFAT .50 calibre MGs are actually very effective for their BR. Tracers are by far the best belt for these main armament, due to the presence of entirely API-T rounds, which easily set fire to enemy planes and provide good penetration and damage capability. Due to the MGs being placed in the centre cowl, they provide heavy damage when fire is focused on your opponent's wings or engines. Unfortunately, MGs in general are ridiculously weak against bombers.

Visibility is normal for a biplane. Rearward vistas are non-existent while forward vision is hampered by the second strut/wing. The open cockpit does provide decent visibility in general, though.

The C.R.42 was Fiat's attempt at modernizing their C.R.32 design, which was deployed during the Spanish Civil War with great success. The new fighter would be of all metal construction, with Fiat's new, home-grown A.74 supercharged radial engine. The result, was a fast, accurate, and manoeuvrable platform, that, while outdated at the onset of World War Two, would be almost the pinnacle of biplane design.

Early in the war, C.R.42s were used with some success as escorts, night fighters, and even interceptors. Against the early Hurricanes and Spitfires, Italian and German pilots both were delighted to find that the manoeuvrability of the Falco put it, at the least, on par in a dogfight. However as the war dragged on, and enemy aircraft became faster, the C.R.42 was relegated to night harassment, light ground attack, and sparingly used as night fighters.

The C.R.42 is also credited with the world's last aerial combat biplane kill. A group of C.R.42s based in Croatia under the command of Nachtschlachtgruppe 7 were directed to Grabovica Airfield for a strafing mission. However, the flight was redirected at the last moment to a harassment mission Northwest of Sisak, where they were intercepted by P-38s of the 14th Fighter Group. Three Fiats were lost for two P-38s, one of which was claimed by an unknown German pilot.
