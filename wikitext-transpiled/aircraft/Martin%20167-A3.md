== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|FN Browning (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 7.5 mm FN Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (800 rpg = 3,200 total)

The four machine guns are arranged in bundles of two mounted in each wing. Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire with each other until empty.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|D.T. No.2 (50 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 8 x 50 kg D.T. No.2 bombs (400 kg total)
- 16 x 50 kg D.T. No.2 bombs (800 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Vickers K (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 7.7 mm Vickers K machine gun, dorsal turret (500 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''High-altitude bomber:''' For high altitude bombing, gaining altitude is a priority, especially to put distance between you and fighters that rumble around the low-mid altitudes. At higher altitudes, mobile targets will be difficult to bomb as they will scatter when your bombs are released. Up high, it is better to focus on immobile targets such as artillery/AA gun emplacements or bases (if they are on the map). In AB, one way to gain altitude is to:

- Immediately on spawn, drop all bombs, hit WEP and climb.
- As WEP runs out, level the plane and wait for the next WEP cycle. It takes about three WEP cycles to get to a decent altitude.
- Remember, as you are climbing, release bombs as they reload to reduce weight.
- Once you are at a decent altitude, fly towards your targets and prepare to bomb utilizing the bomb sight (V).
- If you start to see fighters working their way up towards you, continue on climbing in between bomb reloading cycles.
- Repeat 4-5 as needed until you get shot down or the game ends.

'''Mid-Low altitude bomber:''' At the mid-low altitudes you are a prime target for fighters, being not as manoeuvrable and a fairly large profile. Here you may only get one chance to drop your bombs before being shot down, so look for holes in the enemy defence where you can slip by, line up a shot, drop your ordnance and manoeuvre out for another run (or reload at base if playing RB/SB). If pressed and there are enemy all around, turn into heavy-fighter mode after your ordnance has been dropped and start pursuing. The turn and loop time is not the greatest, however this aircraft has a strong rudder and can do a power-on wing-over, quickly changing directions without much loss in energy (and a surprise to some pursuit aircraft who think they have you nailed). At this point, you can also transition to attacker mode.

'''Attacker (on the deck):''' While the four wing mounted 7.5 mm FN Browning machine guns may not seem like much, when coupled with the 50 kg bombs, you can rack up some vehicle kills. While strafing the ground, all soft targets are available as the vehicles will not have much time to get out of the way of your ordnance. In AB it is best to use your 3rd person view to use the bombing indicator as you will need to fly the aircraft and bomb at the same time (vs. using (V) and solely utilizing the bomb sight while the AI keeps the aircraft level). In between bombing reloads you can strafe with your 4 x 7.5 mm machine guns to eliminate artillery/AA gun emplacements and armoured vehicles. While on the deck, you will typically encounter enemy aircraft and can divert to go after them if given the chance or perform evasive manoeuvres while your gunner fires away (you get credit for hits, so let him fire away!).

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Decently manoeuvrable for a bomber
- Short take off distance (which is great for maps with short runways)
- Fast
- Tracer belts for the forward-firing MGs are literal flamethrowers
- Good visibility from the cockpit.
- Decent rate of climb at full load (best when ordnance is released)
- Strong rudder control - aids in sharper manoeuvres

'''Cons:'''

- No armour protection whatsoever
- Weak defensive firepower
- Very light stock payload
- Rear gunner field of vision and fire is small
- Extremely prone to fuel fires
- (RB/SB) Flaps tear off quickly and at moderate speed (easily red-lines in a dive)
- Offensive machine guns are mounted so far apart that they are virtually useless (you won't be able to hit a truck with all 4, for example)

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Martin Model 167 medium bomber was developed as a response to a set of requirements issued by the USAAC in 1938. Following these requirements, Martin developed its Model 167 bomber, which received its official testing designation of XA-22. However, despite showing favorable performance, the XA-22 lost out to the Douglas DB-7 (which became A-20 Havoc) during the competition, which resulted in Douglas getting the contract with the USAAC. What would usually spell disaster for most projects that suffered a fate like this, turned out to not to be the case for Martin's design. With an armed conflict looming over Europe, nations such as France and the UK were desperately stocking up with any military equipment that was on offer, including aircraft. France in particular was looking into buying any available aircraft from manufacturers abroad as the domestic production was limited. These manufacturers were in many cases American companies, just like Martin. In any case, the first orders for French export versions of Martin's new bomber soon came in, effectively sparing the project from ruin.

The first order called for more than 200 Martin 167s to be built with certain modifications made to optimize it for French use, such as the installation of French armament, including guns, metric instruments and different engines. Martin, eager to fulfill the order, nearly doubled production and managed to manufacture over 100 aircraft in the space of six months. However, the shipment of ready units was delayed until October 1939 until the U.S. arms embargo was lifted. During this period, the French placed an order for an additional 100 aircraft to be made. However, before the order could be entirely fulfilled, France had been occupied by Germany in June 1940 and only 25 further aircraft made it to France after the initial batch. Nonetheless, the units that made it to France performed well in combat, out matching some of France's domestic bomber aircraft, such as the LeO 451 in combat efficiency and loss rates. Once the armistice was signed, the remaining aircraft were transferred to the African theater of operations, placed under Vichy command and took part in bombing missions against allied positions. In 1943, the Martin 167s stationed in Africa were replaced by newer allied aircraft once the local French forces joined the allies again. A total of around 450 Martin 167 bombers were manufactured and the aircraft continued to serve among the ranks of the French and British air forces until 1945.
