== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 15 mm Steel - Behind the pilot
* 15 mm Steel - Pilot's headrest
* 15 mm Steel - Between cockpit and fore fuel tank
* 15 mm Steel - Instrument panel plate
* 16 mm Steel x 2 - Ammunition protection plates
* 90 mm Bulletproof glass
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 behind guns, 1 below pilot's feet, 1 behind pilot)

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MK 108 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 30 mm MK 108 cannons, nose-mounted (90 rpg = 360 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|SC250JA (250 kg)|SC500K (500 kg)|R4M|Wfr.Gr.21}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 250 kg SC250JA bombs (500 kg total)
* 1 x 500 kg SC500K bomb (500 kg total)
* 24 x R4M rockets
* 48 x R4M rockets
* 2 x Wfr.Gr.21 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
It is basically a modified [[Me 262 A-1a]] and should be played in a similar fashion (air superiorityfighter or bomber interceptor). However, the Me 262 A-1a/Jabo can be brought into Ground RB more effectively than the previous model since it has the ability to carry 2 x 250 kg bombs, 1 x 500 kg bomb or 2 x Wfr.Gr.21 rockets, which can also be equipped in the rare [[Me 262 A-2a]] Sturmvogel.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:''' 

* Heavy armament of 4 x 30 mm MK 108 cannons
* Minengeschoß rounds can obliterate any aircraft
* More agile than most early jets
* Ability to carry suspended armament unlike the previous model
* Can spawn in the air at the beginning of Air RB, contrary to most of the other variants

'''Cons:'''

* Poor acceleration and climb rate 
* Like most Me 262s, it has a long takeoff run 
* The slow muzzle velocity and poor accuracy of the MK 108s make it difficult to hit manoeuvring targets
* The exposed and fragile engines make it vulnerable to fire and oil leaks
* Fuel feed cuts off if flying with negative G-loads for an extended period of time 
* Tends to "flip about" after doing vertical manoeuvres
* Unusually high wing angle of attack is required for level flight at most speed ranges so the aircraft tends to bleed energy when turning

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.
