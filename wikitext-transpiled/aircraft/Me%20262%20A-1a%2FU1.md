== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a squadron rank {{Specs|rank}} German strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]]. It can be unlocked with squadron activity points or purchased with Golden Eagles.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Me 262 A-1a/U1 severely lacks engine power compared to its contemporaries and is heavy, resulting in a lacklustre acceleration and a poor climb rate. Control surfaces compress above 650 km/h and G-LOC becomes prominent when slightly manoeuvring above 700 km/h. It also performs poorly in a stall, as the control surfaces become ineffective below 350 km/h, making recoveries difficult.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 15 mm Steel - Behind the pilot
* 15 mm Steel - Pilot's headrest
* 15 mm Steel - Between cockpit and fore fuel tank
* 15 mm Steel - Instrument panel plate
* 16 mm Steel x 2 - Ammunition protection plates
* 90 mm Bulletproof glass

The engines are very fragile. Any hit at this BR often results in critical damage

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MK 103 (30 mm)|MK 108 (30 mm)|MG 151 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm MK 103 cannons, nose-mounted (72 rpg = 144 total)
* 2 x 30 mm MK 108 cannons, nose-mounted (66 rpg = 132 total)
* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, nose-mounted (146 rpg = 292 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

As a modified [[Me 262 A-1a]], its role in the battle has not changed that much. The added cannons (namely, the MK 103) make the plane more capable at its battle rating. The MK 103s can carry an ammo belt that has the capability of penetrating the roofs of some tanks when playing in Ground Realistic battles. It is advisable to fire each pair of cannons separately, because all of its autocannons have a different muzzle velocity (about 200 m/s) and different amounts of ammunition. MK 108s will run dry first, followed by the MK 103s, and lastly the MG 151s.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent offensive armament of 6 autocannons
* MK 103 cannons can fire HVAP rounds that penetrate 77 mm of armour
* MK 103s have a relatively high muzzle velocity

'''Cons:'''

* Lacklustre acceleration and poor climb rate
* Control surfaces compress above 650 km/h
* Poor stall performance, control surfaces are ineffective below 350 km/h
* G-LOC quickly becomes prominent when slightly manoeuvring above 700 km/h
* Poor survivability. Getting hit by anything often results in critical damage, especially the engines
* Inaccurate and slow guns, difficult to use
* Lack of suspended armaments

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Me 262A-1a/U1 is a modification of the world's first mass produced jet fighter, the German [[Me 262 A-1a|Me 262]] 'Schwalbe'. The armament of the A-1 sub-serie, being four 30 mm MK 108 auto cannons, had a number of drawbacks, such as cycle failures and complex heavy shell ballistics. For these reasons, engineers experimented with different variations as to the weaponry, including a reinforced cannon battery. As such, the Me.262A-1a/U1 modification was created as part of this program. German engineers managed to fit 6 autocannons in the nose: 2 x 20 mm MG.151/20, 2 x 30 mm stock version MK 108, and 2 x 30 mm MK 103 guns. For the latter, they developed shells with a higher initial speed, and the guns themselves had a longer barrel length than the MK 108, as well as an effective muzzle brake - all to improve the ballistics of the heavy shells. They built a prototype (according to other sources, there were three units), but the project was not entered into mass production. However, one example was flown by one of the most effective jet aces of World War II, Heinz Bär, who flew it at the end of April 1945, and with it, even shot down several Thunderbolts in the skies over Germany.
