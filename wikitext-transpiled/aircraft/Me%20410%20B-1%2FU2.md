== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Me 410 B variant was intended to improve on the Me 410 A with better engines. DB 603G engines were planned to be installed, but production and design issues meant the DB 603G would never be put into any aircraft. Thus, the Me 410 B was essentially just a Me 410 A but with more fuel, strengthened undercarriage, and an oxygen system for high-altitude flight. The Me 410 B-1/U2 was specifically almost identical to the [[Me 410 A-1/U2|A-1/U2]], except for the improvements that came with the B variant. The B-1/U2 was intended to fight against bomber formations and received the WB 151A modification set, which added two MG 151s. It also had an armoured glass windscreen and a fighter gunsight.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' twin-engine fighter has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. It is very similar to the other Me 410 variants, with the exception of having more guns and [[Wfr.Gr.21]] rockets. The Me 410 B-1/U2 has a slight difference in weaponry compared to the A-1/U2. Instead of having two 7.92 mm machine guns like the A-1/U2, the B-1/U2 replaced the machine guns with two 13 mm machine guns. Other than that, they are essentially the same aircraft in terms of capability.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This plane is great for capturing airfields because you can use it to approach very close to the ground and very, very fast up to the very last moment. This is because of the Hornisse's effective airbrake. When running towards the runway, don't hesitate to put the pedal to the metal up to really shortly before touchdown, then push off the airbrake, gear and all flaps (in that order). Ignore all warning and try to touch-down with about 200-240 km/h.

It is also suitable for chasing all sorts of bombers. Due to its heavy nose armament, taking down nearly any enemy is just a matter of seconds.

Your greatest advantage, however, is the planes' speed, certainly not its manoeuvrability.

For this reason, always try to get into power fighting when it comes to taking on with single-engined enemies. Try to stay in a group. Your defence weaponry will serve you as well as it will your allies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The ME 410's fuselage is quite durable and withstands a good punch
* Its defensive armament, once fully installed, is remarkably effective, especially when it comes along with a skilled crew
* It can reach amazing high levels of speed within its class, which is especially effective in a bomb run or when fleeing the enemy
* Effective airbrakes, they work great especially when diving

'''Cons:'''

* Like most twin-engine planes, the "Hornisse" is not as manoeuvrable as a single-engined fighter
* When pulling up, the plane loses speed extensively

April 1944 saw the Me 410 B version replace the Me 410 A on the assembly lines. The main distinction of this variant was its Daimler-Benz DB 603G twelve-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine. The new engines had an increased boost and compression ratio, which allowed a takeoff power of 1,900 hp.

The aircraft's armament was reinforced. The pair of 7.92 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 17 machine guns mounted in the nose section were replaced with the same number of the more powerful and efficient 13 mm large-calibre Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 131 machine guns.

Me 410 B planes could now have two additional 300-litre fuel tanks suspended under their wing panels, and the main landing gear legs were extended.

Just as it was in the case of the Me 410 A, two main versions of the aircraft saw full-scale production: the Me 410 B-1 high-speed bomber and the Me 410 B-2 "destroyer". Various Rüstsatz and Umbausatz kits were used on these aircraft.

The Me 410 B-1/U2 and the Me 410 B-1/U4 had armament corresponding to the same versions of the A-1 modification: either a pair of 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons (the U2 kit), or a 50 mm Rheinmetall BK 5 cannon (the U4 kit).

The Me 410 B-2/U2 version of the aircraft had a WB 151 ventral container with two more 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons.

In addition to the 50 mm Rheinmetall BK 5 cannon mounted in the bomb bay, Me 410 B-2/U4 planes had a pair of 30 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 103 cannons installed. To make room, their 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannon and 13 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 131 machine guns were removed. About a hundred such kits were delivered to the Luftwaffe's troops on the front lines.

Several more "field modification kits" for the Me 410 B-2 were developed for the purpose of fighting Allied bombers. The R2 kit included a WB 108 container with two 30 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 108 cannons. The R3 kit also allowed the mounting of additional 30 mm cannons of a different type (Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 103) in a WB 103 container.

In addition to a WB 151 container, planes equipped with the R4 kit received two additional 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons mounted under the fuselage. Planes with the R5 kit received a container with four Mauser MG 151/20 cannons, mounted in the bomb bay.

In April 1944, several Me 410 B-2/U4 aircraft received a 37 mm Rheinmetall BK 3.7 aircraft anti-tank cannon for trial.
