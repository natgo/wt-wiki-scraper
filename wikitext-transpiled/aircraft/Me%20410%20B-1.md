== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
In general, the Me 410 B-1's flight characteristics are adequate. It can accelerate reasonably fast, and its roll rate is average. However, its turn time is not as good as single-engine fighters (which is to be expected), but it may be able to outturn some other heavy fighters. It does not lock up at high speeds, meaning you can dive on enemies without having to worry about that. Even when approaching rip speed, the flight performance stays largely, the same. The DB 603s are excellent engines, and when spaded, at low altitude, without payload, and flying straight, you should be able to manage 470 km/h. However, at higher altitudes, it can go even faster, thanks to its supercharger, reaching speeds past 500 km/h.

{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 131 (13 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, cheek-mounted (350 rpg = 700 total)
* 2 x 13 mm MG 131 machine guns, fuselage-mounted (600 rpg = 1,200 total)

{{main|SC50JA (50 kg)|SC250JA (250 kg)|SC500K (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 8 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (400 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg SC250JA bombs (500 kg total)
* 2 x 500 kg SC500K bombs (1,000 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 131 (13 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 13 mm MG 131 machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (500 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This aircraft, like its predecessors, benefits from a large supply of ammo. When performing ground attacks against soft targets, firing the machine guns separately enables better conservation of the more relevant cannon ammo. It is recommended to use stealth ammo for the machine guns and another belt for the cannons that include tracers, as this enables the pilot to easier gauge the 20 mm's trajectory.

In terms of MEC, the Me 410 B-1 does not offer much. You can control the propeller pitch and radiators, but nothing else. Usually, you can keep the radiators at around 40%, but you may have to increase it to a little past 50% if WEP is engaged, or if your water cooling system is damaged. Unlike the DB 601 from which it was derived from, the DB 603 does not conk out if propeller pitch is increased to 100%, and can be kept there. If your engines are dead and you need to glide back to base, decrease it as needed.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Well armed, mounting 13 mm and 20 mm cannons
* Improves offensive armament, with the 7.92 mm MGs replaced with 13 mm MGs
* Good amount of ammunition for both weapons
* Quite durable, well armoured
* Great straight-line top speed for a heavy fighter
* Sustains high speeds in dives
* Air brakes (useful for dive recovery, dogfighting and landing)
* Without air brakes, accelerates quickly in a dive, allowing for quick escapes
* Retains speed created in a dive for a while
* Good forward visibility (in Simulator)
* Stable flyer
* Machine guns allow for a less wasteful ground attack

'''Cons:'''

* Not very manoeuvrable (although quite reasonable amongst heavy fighters)
* Poor energy retention
* Less firepower than the Me 410 A-1/U2
* Different forward-firing guns means two trajectories to know
* Rather large target

== History ==

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

April 1944 saw the Me 410 B version replace the Me 410 A on the assembly lines. The main distinction of this variant was its Daimler-Benz DB 603G twelve-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine. The new engines had an increased boost and compression ratio, which allowed a takeoff power of 1,900 hp.

The aircraft's armament was reinforced. The pair of 7.92 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 17 machine guns mounted in the nose section were replaced with the same number of the more powerful and efficient 13 mm large-calibre Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 131 machine guns.

Me 410 B planes could now have two additional 300-litre fuel tanks suspended under their wing panels, and the main landing gear legs were extended.

Just as it was in the case of the Me 410 A, two main versions of the aircraft saw full-scale production: the Me 410 B-1 high-speed bomber and the Me 410 B-2 "destroyer". Various Rüstsatz and Umbausatz kits were used on these aircraft.

The Me 410 B-1/U2 and the Me 410 B-1/U4 had armament corresponding to the same versions of the A-1 modification: either a pair of 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons (the U2 kit), or a 50 mm Rheinmetall BK 5 cannon (the U4 kit).

The Me 410 B-2/U2 version of the aircraft had a WB 151 ventral container with two more 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons.

In addition to the 50 mm Rheinmetall BK 5 cannon mounted in the bomb bay, Me 410 B-2/U4 planes had a pair of 30 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 103 cannons installed. To make room, their 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannon and 13 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 131 machine guns were removed. About a hundred such kits were delivered to the Luftwaffe's troops on the front lines.

Several more "field modification kits" for the Me 410 B-2 were developed for the purpose of fighting Allied bombers. The R2 kit included a WB 108 container with two 30 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 108 cannons. The R3 kit also allowed the mounting of additional 30 mm cannons of a different type (Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 103) in a WB 103 container.

In addition to a WB 151 container, planes equipped with the R4 kit received two additional 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons mounted under the fuselage. Planes with the R5 kit received a container with four Mauser MG 151/20 cannons, mounted in the bomb bay.

In April 1944, several Me 410 B-2/U4 aircraft received a 37 mm Rheinmetall BK 3.7 aircraft anti-tank cannon for trial.
