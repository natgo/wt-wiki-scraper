== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

[[File:Meteor III Screenshot 2.jpg|thumb]]

The toughest enemies to fight in the Meteor F Mk 3 are perhaps the [[Ki-200]], [[Me 163 B|Me 163]], and [[Ho 229 V3|Ho 229]]. These aircraft are faster and have better acceleration.

To combat a Ho 229: the flying wing has a worse roll rate than the Meteor so scissors are the best way to counter them. A split-S or an Immelmann is not recommended as the Ho 229 has better energy retention.

The Me 163B and the Ki-200 are in theory easier to fight since the main priority is to simply survive long enough that they run out of fuel. The Mark 3 has a higher wing lift to mass ratio. Thus, it can barely out-turn the rocket planes (even with their rocket engines enabled), but this is very dangerous and only the better-skilled pilot will come out of a turn fight alive.

If the enemy is smart enough to dive and gather a little more speed for extra manoeuvrability, go up instead and roll over the enemy. If the enemy goes up, go up with it but be prepared for a hammerhead attack. If one does come, roll yourself over to provide the minimum surface area that he can attack and pitch down to the earth (to gather a little more speed for extra manoeuvrability). Continue doing this until the rocket plane gives up or runs out of fuel.

Do not chase the rocket plane directly if it decides to flee, but climb slightly faster than the best rate of climb (approximately 190 knots / 350 km/h / 220 mph) and if he flies directly overhead for the strike, simply perform a shallow dive and pull a horizontal turn to ruin their approach. Continue doing this until they run out of fuel.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Good turn rate
- Decent climb rate and energy retention
- Decent manoeuvrability at low speeds
- Good acceleration for an early jet
- Useful airbrakes, hard to rip the wings if you use them correctly
- Can limp back to the airfield on one engine
- The 4 x 20 mm cannons are accurate
- Effective air targets ammo belt

'''Cons:'''

- Low top speed
- Easily rips wings (500 mph+)
- Below average roll rate
- Poor rear cockpit visibility in Sim battles (hurts when performing scissors)

[[File:Meteor III Screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|Cockpit of the Meteor Mk 3]]

The Gloster Meteor F Mk 3 was the first version of the Meteor to be produced in large numbers, the Mk 3 was significantly heavier than the previous versions of the Meteor, however, it also improved the performance dramatically, the first prototype for the Mk 3 specification (DG209) first flew on the 18th April 1944 and immediately demonstrated its performance improvement by reaching 465 mph (748 km/h) at 16,000 ft, this demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the Meteor Mk 1. The initial 15 aircraft of Mk 3 production were fitted with earlier Rolls Royce W.2B/23c Welland powerplant which was carried over from the Meteor Mk 1, these first 15 airframes of course had reduced performance due to these earlier powerplants being used, shortly after production started the Rolls-Royce Derwent I powerplant became available, this engine increased the power to 2,000 lb of thrust per engine, this was the most common powerplant for the Mk 3, although later in the production run examples were fitted with the later Derwent IV engine which increased thrust to 2,400 lb per engine, giving yet another performance improvement. The final 15 production models were fitted with extended engine nacelles in common with those developed for the later Meteor Mk 4, these increased the performance of the aircraft yet again, this would mark the final major modification to the Mk 3 design before the Meteor Mk 4 would begin production.

The Meteor Mk 3 was used operationally by No.616 and 504 squadrons during WW2, although they were only used in action by 616 squadron, during the closing months of the war in Europe the Meteor Mk 3 was used by No.616 squadron for armed reconnaissance and ground attack, it was hoped that the Meteor would encounter the Messerschmitt 262 and be able to demonstrate its superior performance, although this confrontation never took place. In the immediate post-war years the Meteor Mk 3 served as the primary fighter for the RAF, until it was replaced by the improved Meteor Mk 4 in mid 1947.

The Gloster Meteor was the RAF's first jet powered aircraft, and the only Allied jet to see combat in the Second World War. An all-metal, single-seat fighter with two turbojet engines, it first entered service in 1944. The aircraft's development started in August 1940 and was given Air Ministry approval in November of the same year. The Ministry of Aircraft Production drew up the official F.9/40 specifications for a heavy interceptor fighter to be designated as Type G.41; the first prototype fighter flew on March 5th 1943 at RAF Cranwell. At the beginning of 1944, the aircraft was launched into full-scale production under the designation of Gloster Meteor F.Mk.I (Type G.41A). The type entered service with No 616 Squadron who, after conversion to the Meteor from their Spitfire Mk.VIIs, used the ground breaking fighter to successfully intercept V-1 'flying bombs' which were being launched from bases in occupied Europe to attack targets in England.

The Gloster Meteor F.Mk.III fighter that entered service in August 1944 became the first full-scale production version of the aircraft. The F.Mk.III version was powered by two Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.I turbojet engines producing 910 kg of thrust. Furthermore, a number of changes were introduced in the design: the dive flaps were improved, the fuel quantity was increased, and the airframe was partially reinforced. Externally, the F.Mk.III differed from the F.Mk.I by its new cockpit canopy, which was not side-opening but sliding.
[[File:Meteor III Screenshot 4.jpg|thumb]]
The fighter's armament consisted of four 20 mm British Hispano Mk.II cannons with 200 rounds per gun in the upper pair and 190 rounds per gun in the lower pair.

A 180-gallon (818 L) fuel tank could be suspended under the fuselage. Two 100 gallon (455 l) external fuel tanks could also be mounted under the wing panels. As an experiment, the suspension of two 500 lb (227 kg) or 1,000 lb (454 kg) bombs or 16 rockets was attempted.

The first F.Mk.III fighters produced in September 1944 had Rolls-Royce Welland engines producing 770 kg of thrust, as the Rolls-Royce Derwents were not yet mass-produced. These aircraft were designated as the G.41C. The 16th and subsequent production aircraft were the first to have standard Derwent Mk.I engines; these were designated as the G.41D. The last 15 production aircraft assembled were the G.41E version, with extended nacelles designed for the subsequent version of the F.Mk.4.

In 1948, two production aircraft were converted to the Gloster (Sea) Meteor F.Mk.3 version for Royal Navy test flights from aircraft carriers. The fighters had their armament removed, a landing hook fitted, and the gear legs reinforced. The Derwent Mk.1 engines were replaced with Derwent Mk.5 models. These aircraft performed 32 landings on board HMS Illustrious.

The Gloster Meteor was the first British production jet fighter and the only Allied jet aircraft to take part in World War II. The first F.Mk.IIIs were delivered to the front in the end of January 1945. Jet aircraft were considered to be secret and, as a result, a great number of limitations were imposed on their combat use. This included a complete withdrawal of permission to operate over German held territory in case the revolutionary technology was captured by the enemy. Meteors did eventually operate out of Belgium as part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force, where they were employed in ground attack and reconnaissance missions.

The total number of F.Mk.III Gloster Meteors built was 210, but service after the end of the Second World War would see further development and operational sorties in combat.
