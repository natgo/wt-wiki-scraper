== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 38 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit front.
- 12.7 mm Steel plate behind the pilot.
- 12.7 mm Steel plate in the nose.
- Critical components located at the front and wings of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano Mk.V (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.V cannons, nose-mounted (200 rpg top + 190 rpg bottom = 780 total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Meteor has a fully air fighting role as the lack of ordnance and penetration for the 20 mm cannons make the aircraft useless for CAS or ground attack. The Meteor has 2 primary combat roles:

'''Bomber hunter:'''

The speed, acceleration, and firepower make this jet usable for bomber hunting. Pilots should use 30° climb to gain speed and altitude to be able to hunt bombers. Depending on the type of bomber that the Meteor encounters (jet bomber or prop bomber), tactics should vary.

'''''For jet bombers:'''''

[[Ar 234 B-2]], [[Ar 234 C-3]], [[IL-28]] (all variants), etc, the pilot must try to use their agility to their advantage as most of them carry both offensive and defensive weaponry and sometimes will try to dogfight you (with exception of Ar 234 B-2 and [[B-57A]]). IL-28 should be approached carefully as the 23 mm offensive and defensive cannons can tear the Meteor apart with small bursts. Use your speed to your advantage.

'''''For prop bombers:'''''

[[B-29/Tu-4 (Family)|B-29/Tu-4]], etc, the pilot must use boom and zoom tactics as big planes lack agility but have powerful firepower. These aircraft should be approached as any other prop bomber (head-on or from below). Be aware of B-29 and Tu-4 as both have ventral turrets that will harm you, approach them in a head-on or in a frontal arc of 45° (blind spot for most turrets) or in a very steep angle from above (although this should not be the main angle of approach as both B-29 and Tu-4 have a turret elevation of 89°).

'''Air superiority fighter:'''

The Meteor, as with previous Meteors, is not a really fast aircraft but a competitive one. Boom-and-zoom against aircraft that are able to outturn you ([[Ho 229 V3|Ho 229]], [[Vampire FB 52A]], etc), and turn against those that are able to outrun you ([[MiG-15]]).

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Good acceleration
- Reasonable top speed
- Clipped wings offer an improvement over the previous model in energy retention and wing durability
- Good at turning below 650 km/h
- Good climb rate
- Excellent ammo capacity for cannons (190 RPG for two of the cannons, 200 RPG for the other two)

'''Cons:'''

- Compression
- Loses manoeuvrability over 700 km/h significantly
- Limited visibility out of the rear of the cockpit

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In 1946 the Gloster Meteor F.Mk.4 was introduced; a variant intended to replace the F.Mk.3. The prototype F.Mk.4 flew for the first time on May 17th 1945; the new variant was powered by Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.5 turbojet engines, producing 1,590 kg of thrust (more than twice as much as the Derwent Mk.1). The engines were fitted in new extended nacelles, which reduced drag, and a strengthened airframe design was incorporated to harness the increased power. Fitted with the new engines, the Meteor F.Mk.4 would go on to set two world air speed records in November 1945 and then again in September 1946.

Further modifications to the Meteor F.Mk.4 included its ailerons and adjustments to its rudder trim tab to reduce snaking. The cockpit was now fully pressurized and ventilated; previous versions of the Meteor had had a non-pressurized cockpit.

Trials of the prototype Gloster Meteor F.Mk.4 fighter showed that its maximum speed was increased by 180 km/h, but that this additional speed produced excessive stress on the wings. The wing panels, therefore, were made shorter from the ninth production aircraft onwards. This reduced the stress and improved horizontal manoeuvrability but reduced the rate of climb and the service ceiling. Type G.41F became the designation for the long-wing aircraft, and Type G.41G for the short-wing variant.

The Gloster Meteor F.Mk.4 represented a significant leap in terms of performance and was produced in large numbers, including as an export fighter. Based on the F.Mk.4, the two-seat T.Mk.7 trainer was developed.

By 1948 the F.Mk.4 had completely replaced the F.Mk.3 in the RAF and In May 1947, an export version was purchased by Argentina, followed by orders from Denmark, Egypt, Belgium and the Netherlands.

535 Gloster Meteor F.Mk.4 were produced for the RAF, with a further 168 aircraft being exported.
