<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 38 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit front.
- 12.7 mm Steel plate in the nose.
- 12.7 mm Steel plate behind the pilot.
- Critical components located at the front and wings of the aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano Mk.V (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.V cannon, nose-mounted (200 rpg top + 190 rpg bottom = 780 total)

At 8.0, the stock Hispano Mk V's are terrible since they are highly inaccurate and generally inconsistent, which is made worse by the fact that in most games aircraft will fly much faster than you, forcing firing ranges to be higher and reducing the window of time in which a shot can be made.

When they are upgraded, they are all round good guns for the BR sporting a good ammunition capacity and a decent velocity. The damage can be quite inconsistent however.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|H.E. M.C. Mk.13 (1,000 lb)|HVAR|RP-3}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 2 x 1,000 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.13 bombs (2,000 lb total)
- 8 x HVAR rockets
- 8 x RP-3 rockets

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Meteor F Mk 8 G.41K is a versatile platform for multiple tasks both in ground and air battles, featuring a competitive armament in air battles and tremendous firepower in ground battles. It is capable of dominating the air in air and ground battles.

'''When in air battles:'''

The Meteor has primarily 3 roles when it comes to air battles: fighter, attacker, bomber. At its br, the Meteor is one of the competitive jet section, not over exceeding in one side but not underperforming either.

'''''As a fighter:'''''

The Meteor is capable of being on par with many planes at its battle rating. Different from most other British fighters, but the same as the other Meteors and similar to the [[Swift F.1]], it has a Boom and Zoom role when it comes to fighting as it will not be able to turn fight like the [[Vampire FB 5]] or the [[Venom FB.4]]. It should be noted that the Meteor will not outrun most of the enemy jets encountered at its br unlike the Swift F.1. The pilot should maintain energy at all times since the acceleration is not great. When engaging heavier and bigger planes (like enemy attackers and bombers both player and AI) the pilot should always try to maintain either higher altitude than them to make Boom and Zoom or stay under their belly to take advantage of their weakspots ([[Tu-4]] and [[B-29A-BN|B-29]] are the exceptions for belly attacks as they have ventral turrets).

'''As an attacker:'''

The ordnance the Meteor carries is enough to do some ground striking, destroying pillboxes, enemy tanks, artillery outposts, anti air emplacements, etc. There is no rule on which armament the attacker should use, it all depends on the pilot's discretion, map, battle rating, etc. It is recommended to use ground targets belts due to the AP ammunition but universal belts may be enough to deal with light armoured vehicles and light pillboxes, leaving the ordnance for heavier and more armoured threats.

'''As a bomber:'''

Due to being a jet, it is able to be a lighting strike bomber. This means to fly the Meteor at a really low altitude (also known as lawn-mowing) with bombs (1,000 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.13 bombs are recommended for base bombing) with a 2-4 second time fuse. When the Meteor is on a base, the pilot should drop the bombs really low to the ground to ensure accuracy as no bombsight is able to be used. It may require practice on how and when to drop the bombs. The 2-4 second fuse makes the plane be able to move to a safe zone away from the blast zone. When no time fuse is set, the Meteor will be forced to drop the bombs at a higher altitude or be prompt to be killed in the blast zone with assault fuse.

'''When in ground battles:'''

The Meteor has only 1 role in ground battles primarily (superiority fighter can be used but it is not recommended to do so), Close Air Support (CAS). The variety of ordnance is enough to be used in all situations depending on the pilot's discretion. RP-3 are launched in pairs (or in salvo depending on the pilots discretion and rocket settings) and will disable or destroy even the heaviest armour encountered with a couple of rockets. The con of rockets is that they are hard to aim, practice will be required. Bombs, on the other hand, are more forgiving when it comes to accuracy as the blast zone is bigger and are able to destroy one or more targets at a time, disable modules (tracks, barrel, engine, etc) or just mark them with fragmentation. The con of bombs is that a fuse might have to be added depending on the way the pilot wants to drop them (lighting strike, dive-bombing, etc), they are also heavier than the rockets, making the attacker more vulnerable to anti-air fire and dogfighting.

When it comes to just the 20 mm cannons, it should be noted that most vehicles the Meteor will encounter ([[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]], [[XM-1 (GM)|XM-1]], [[BMP-2]], etc) will have a poorly armoured roof which the armour-piercing shells will penetrate. Heavier targets ([[ZTZ59D1|ZTZ-59D1]], [[T-62]], [[T-10M]]) will only be able to be killed with suspended ordnance as they will not be able to penetrate the roof.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Engines are a massive improvement over previous models, with high speed and acceleration rates compared
- Great at turning below 650 km/h
- Good climb rate
- Controllable roll rate
- Able to carry suspended payloads (unlike other Meteors)
- The flight performance is still good when carrying bombs

'''Cons:'''

- Compression
- Hispano Mk V cannons have poor accuracy, and are borderline unusable when stock
- Wing controls tend to lose control ability at higher speeds
- Poor energy retention, struggles to keep up with some aircraft
- Limited visibility out of the rear of the cockpit

Faced with an increasing quality in the standard of potential adversaries by the late 1940s, Gloster designers embarked on developing a new version of their Meteor fighter, designated the Gloster Meteor F.Mk.8 (Type G.41K).

The first prototype F.Mk.8 was converted from a production F.Mk.4, before a full prototype flew on October 12th 1948. Production began in 1949 and, after the RAF stood up its first operational squadrons in 1950, export versions were then produced.

The F.Mk.8 differed in a number of key areas from the F.Mk.4 on which it was based; the F.Mk.8 had an elongated fuselage and the tail assembly was changed, both features incorporated to increase stability. An extra 432-litre fuel tank was also added and a blown cockpit canopy was mounted to increase visibility.

The F.Mk.8 was powered by Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.8 turbojet engines producing 1,630 kg of thrust. The diameter of the engine's air intakes was increased, adding approximately 100 kg of thrust to each engine, bringing the aircraft's maximum speed to 950 km/h. The wing structure was significantly reinforced, with additional alloy steels being used in the framework. The nacelle structure was changed yet again to improve access.

The F.Mk.8 had the F.Mk.4's 20mm British Hispano Mk.II cannons replaced by Hispano Mk.V cannons of the same calibre but with a higher rate of fire, reliability and ballistic characteristics. A standard mount to suspend HVAR missiles was provided under the wing panels. The F.Mk.8 was the first Meteor to be fitted with a Martin Baker ejection seat; the pilot's chances of survival in an emergency were significantly increased, but the large headrest impaired his rear view.

747 Gloster Meteor F.Mk.8 fighters were produced by April 1954 and were (at various times) in service with over 40 RAF squadrons. From 1950 to 1955, the Meteor F.Mk.8 was the mainstay of RAF Fighter Command.

The F.Mk.8 aircraft were also accepted for service with the Air Forces of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands and Syria. Meteors of the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) took part in the Korean War although they were outmatched by the more modern MiG 15; although several MiG 15s were destroyed by pilots of 77 Squadron RAAF, losses were heavier and the Meteor was re-roled to ground attack.

Experience in the Korean War highlighted the fact that, even with significant upgrades to its original design, the Meteor was now outclassed by more modern fighters. Different Gloster Meteor versions were flown in training and auxiliary units until the last Meteor trainers were phased out of service with the RAF in 1965.
