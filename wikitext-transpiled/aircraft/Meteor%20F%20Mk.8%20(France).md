== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]].

Belgium built a fleet of around 240 Meteor F Mk.8 jet fighters, starting with an order of around thirty aircraft from Gloster Aircraft Company in 1949. A larger batch of Meteors was then ordered from production lines in the Netherlands, built by Fokker. Following the completion of that order, Fairey subsidiary Avions Fairey constructed around seventy aircraft locally in Gosselies, Belgium. These aircraft would constitute a large part of Belgium's jet fighter fleet and served until 1963. 

This aircraft's camouflage represents Meteor F Mk.8 'EG224' of the Belgian Air Force, currently on display at the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels, Belgium.

The Meteor F Mk 8 (France) is a versatile platform for multiple tasks both in ground and air battles, featuring a competitive armament in air battles and tremendous firepower in ground battles. It is capable of dominating the air in air and ground battles.

'''When in air battles:'''

The Meteor has primarily 3 roles when it comes to air battles: fighter, attacker, bomber. At its br, the Meteor is one of the competitive jet section, not over exceeding in one side but not underperforming either.

'''As a fighter:'''

The Meteor is capable of being on par with many planes at its battle rating. Different from most other British fighters, but the same as the other Meteors and similar to the [[Swift F.1]], it has a Boom and Zoom role when it comes to fighting as it will not be able to turn fight like the [[Vampire FB 5]] or the [[Venom FB.4]]. It should be noted that the Meteor will not outrun most of the enemy jets encountered at its br unlike the Swift F.1. The pilot should maintain energy at all times since the acceleration is not great. When engaging heavier and bigger planes (like enemy attackers and bombers both player and AI) the pilot should always try to maintain either higher altitude than them to make Boom and Zoom or stay under their belly to take advantage of their weakspots ([[Tu-4]] and [[B-29A-BN|B-29]] are the exceptions for belly attacks as they have ventral turrets).

'''As an attacker:'''

The ordnance the Meteor carries is enough to do some ground striking, destroying pillboxes, enemy tanks, artillery outposts, anti air emplacements, etc. There is no rule on which armament the attacker should use, it all depends on the pilot's discretion, map, battle rating, etc. It is recommended to use ground targets belts due to the AP ammunition but universal belts may be enough to deal with light armoured vehicles and light pillboxes, leaving the ordnance for heavier and more armoured threats.

'''When in ground battles:'''

The Meteor has only 1 role in ground battles primarily (superiority fighter can be used but it is not recommended to do so), Close Air Support (CAS). The variety of ordnance is enough to be used in all situations depending on the pilot's discretion. RP-3 are launched in pairs (or in salvo depending on the pilots discretion and rocket settings) and will disable or destroy even the heaviest armour encountered with a couple of rockets. The con of rockets is that they are hard to aim, practice will be required. 

When it comes to just the 20 mm cannons, it should be noted that most vehicles the Meteor will encounter ([[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]], [[XM-1 (GM)|XM-1]], [[BMP-2]], etc) will have a poorly armoured roof which the armour-piercing shells will penetrate. Heavier targets ([[ZTZ59D1|ZTZ-59D1]], [[T-62]], [[T-10M]]) will only be able to be killed with suspended ordnance as they will not be able to penetrate the roof.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Engines are a massive improvement over previous models, with high speed and acceleration rates compared
* Great at turning below 650 km/h
* Good climb rate
* Controllable roll rate
* Able to carry RP-3 (unlike other Meteors)

'''Cons:'''

* Hispano Mk V cannons have poor accuracy
* Wing controls tend to lose control ability at higher speeds
* Limited visibility out of the rear of the cockpit

== History ==

Following the establishment of the Belgian Air Force in 1946, its day fighter units originally standardised on the Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XIV. However, developments in military aviation made it clear that propeller-driven fighter types such as the Spitfire were verging on the edge of obsolete, and as early as 1947 the Belgian government expressed its interest in jet-powered fighter types. Following the evaluation and demonstration of both the Gloster Meteor and De Havilland Vampire at the Melsbroek Air Base in 1947, the former was selected to replace the Spitfires of the Belgian Air Force's no. 1 Wing at Beauvechain, with 48 Meteor F.4s (Belgian serials EF-1 to EF-48) being ordered on March 23rd 1949 to equip the Wing's squadrons, Nos. 349 and 350 Squadrons (16 aircraft each), with the balance initially being stored as attrition replacements before the decision was taken to use the aircraft to establish an additional squadron within the 1st Wing (No. 4 Squadron).

In April of 1948, Belgium became a co-signatory to the Western Union Defence Organisation, and as part of its defence commitments, a profound expansion of the Belgian Air Force was proposed, with its expansion to 12 day fighter and 3 night fighter squadrons. To fulfill these commitments, it was proposed to purchase no less than 288 Meteor day fighters - enough to equip 12 squadrons with 16 aircraft each (or 192 aircraft in total), as well as establishing a 'war reserve' of 50% (or 96 additional aircraft). Following the initial order of 48 Meteor F.4s, a series of follow-up orders was placed for the improved F.8 variant.

The initial order of Belgian Meteor F.8s was made in 1949, consisting of 23 aircraft diverted from an RAF order (Belgian serials EG-201 to 223) for service with 350 Squadron; these were followed by an order of 145 aircraft which would be built under license by Fokker at Schiphol Airport (Belgian serials EG-1 to EG-145) as well as an additional five ex-RAF Meteors overhauled by Fokker (Belgian serials EG-146 to EG-150). In addition, Gloster agreed to deliver 37 knock-down kits to Fairey Aviation for assembly at Gosselies (Belgian serials EG-224 to EG-260); Fokker in turn delivered an additional 30 Fokker-produced knock-down kits to Fairey Aviation for further assembly (Belgian serials EG-151 to 180).

Deliveries of the Meteor F.8s to the Belgian Air Force started in November of 1950, initially consisting of the diverted RAF order (November 1950 to February 1951); with deliveries of the Fokker-built Meteors commencing a month later (December 1950 to October 1954). The five additional ex-RAF Meteors were delivered in October 1951; and deliveries of Fairey-built Meteors commenced in August of 1952, lasting until October 1954. This steady stream of new aircraft allowed not only for the Belgian Air Force's existing day fighter squadrons to convert to the type, but also for a whole host of new squadrons to be established. Between 1949 and 1958, the 1st Wing at Beauvechain (349, 350 and 4 Squadron, all ex-Spitfire); 7th Wing at Chièvres (7, 8 and 9 Squadron, newly established in 1950); 13th Wing at Brustem (25, 29 and 33 Squadron, newly established in 1953); and 9th Wing at Bierset (22, 26 and 30 Squadron, all ex-Thunderjet); and the Fighter School, Target Tow Flight and 24 Squadron at Koksijde all flew the Meteor F.8; in addition, the 11th Squadron at Beauvechain, even though it was an All-Weather Squadron equipped with the Meteor NF.11 night-fighter variant, also kept a number of Meteor F.8s to allow its pilots to maintain their flying hours.

With the delivery of the Hunter F.4 from June 1956 onwards, the 1st, 7th and 9th Wing would quickly cede their Meteors; while the 13th Wing and 24th Squadron would be disbanded in 1958, leaving only the Fighter School and Target Tow Flight as the Belgian Air Force's sole remaining Meteor units. The latter unit disbanded on November 8th 1963, marking the end of 14 years of Gloster Meteor service in the Belgian Air Force.
