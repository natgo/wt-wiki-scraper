== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.39]].

[[File:CockpitImage_MiG-15.jpg|thumbnail|right|The MiG-15's instrument panel.]]

The MiG-15bis has a great thrust to weight ratio, allowing for amazing acceleration and energy retention. Players will soon discover that the MiG-15bis is able to almost out climb any other jet fighter within their battle rating. Likewise, players would also notice that the rudder locks up at high speeds, soon followed by the ailerons, and elevators . The MiG is also sluggish in low speed combat, especially in terms of roll rate.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|N-37D (37 mm)|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 37 mm N-37D cannon, chin-mounted (40 rpg)
* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, chin-mounted (80 rpg = 160 total)

{{main|FAB-100M-43 (100 kg)|FAB-250M-46 (250 kg)|S-5K|S-5M|S-21}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100M-43 bombs (200 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg FAB-250M-46 bombs (500 kg total)
* 16 x S-5K rockets
* 16 x S-5M rockets
* 2 x S-21 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The most common enemies of the MiG-15bis are, of course, the F-86 Sabres, although the Banshee/Panther/Cougar line is also a threat. The MiG's main disadvantage is that its wing is vulnerable to ripping in the rolling turn. The Sabre doesn't have this same issue so don't try to out-roll the Sabre, use your extremely good energy retention to zoom back up to higher altitude and then re-engage in a dive.

The MiG's hard-hitting cannons (2 x 23 mm and 1 x 37 mm) are a hard learning curve if the players are untrained in the low velocity cannons. Although the damage output is a large benefit.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great acceleration
* Superior climb rate
* Powerful armament, combination 37 mm and 23 mm cannons devastate targets
* Low wing loading which results in great manoeuvrability
* Great in vertical manoeuvres
* Good flaps that allow them to be deployed even at high speeds (up to 800 km/h IAS)
* High service ceiling
* Excellent high altitude performance especially against aircraft such as [[F-86 (Family)|Sabres]]
* S-21 rockets with good fuse time (1,000 m) result in a very high chance of head-on winning

'''Cons:'''

* Low roll rate especially at high speeds
* Control surfaces are highly stiffening at high speeds
* Hard to aim due to low-velocity guns and curved trajectory
* Guns can spark frequently, especially with stock belts
* Low amount of ammo
* No air-to-air missiles
* Long turn times at high speeds
* Poor forward visibility in simulator, as a large canopy frame and the gunsight block the top and bottom

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

After World War II was over, the leaders of the USSR realized that they were behind the leading states of the world in the sphere of jet aircraft construction, most notably in the full-scale production of turbojet engines. Consequently, a delegation including the designers A. I. Mikoyan and V. Y. Klimov was sent to Great Britain towards the end of 1946. Their negotiations were successful, resulting in the purchase of two of the most advanced turbojet engines at that time: the Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.V and the Rolls-Royce Nene I/Nene II. The British consented to sell their newest strategic designs easily enough since they believed that the Soviet industrial/technological apparatus could not handle the mass production of sophisticated assemblies. However, very soon that the Rolls-Royce engines were launched into full-scale Soviet production under the designations RD-500 and RD-45.

The emergence of the new engines led to the creation of Soviet jet fighters able to compete with the leading models of the world. In 1947, the Mikoyan Design Bureau started the development of a front line fighter with a Nene (RD-45) turbojet engine and an airtight cockpit: the I-310 (""S""). The first S-01 prototype aircraft made its first flight on December 30, 1947, and, after working on the test results, was launched into full-scale production in 1948 under the designation MiG-15. The plane's airframe was an all-metal monoplane configuration with mid-swept wings and empennage. Thus the MiG-15 became the first production swept-wing fighter.

The MiG-15 was equipped with an RD-45F single-shaft turbojet engine rated at 2,270 kg of thrust with a double-entry centrifugal compressor. The plane's armament included a 37 mm Nudelman N-37D cannon with 40 rounds and two 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23KM guns with 160 rounds in total. The cannons were mounted in the forward fuselage on a lowerable carriage. Two 100 kg or 50 kg bombs could be suspended under the wings. To increase its flight range, the aircraft could carry two external fuel tanks with a capacity ranging from 250 to 600 litres.

The MiG-15 fighter was notable for its simple and reliable structure, high flight and operating characteristics, and powerful armament. Its maximum speed, rate of climb, ceiling, and flight range were the best among Soviet fighters at the time and superior to many foreign aircraft, as well.

The first production MiG-15s with RD-45F engines began to leave the factory floor in early 1949. In 1950, more advanced MiG-15bis fighters replaced them in the factory assembly lines.
