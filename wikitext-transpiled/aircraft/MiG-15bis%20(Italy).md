== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the early '50s, a design proposal for an upgraded MiG-15, titled the MiG-15bis (second), was issued. The main upgrade was the new VK-1 engine, offering considerably more thrust. The MiG-15bis saw massive export to almost every corner of the world, and the neighbouring Eastern Bloc was no exception. The Hungarian Air Force was one of the primary MiG-15bis operators of the time, and was also one of the countries acting as an "interceptor net" for the USSR. As a result, Hungarian MiG-15bis aircraft took part in many interceptions of NATO aircraft probing in their airspace. This culminated on 19 November 1951, when MiG-15bis pilot 1st Lieutenant A. A. Kalugin forced a USAF C-47 to land at the Hungarian airbase at Pápa, after it had penetrated Hungarian airspace. The Hungarian MiG-15bis would serve for many years before eventually being replaced by the [[MiG-17PF (Italy)|MiG-17]] and [[MiG-21MF (Italy)|MiG-21]] for the frontline fighter and interceptor roles respectively.

Introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a Hungarian operated copy of the [[MiG-15bis]] found in the Hungarian sub-tree of the Italian tech tree. The Hungarian MiG-15bis is a identical copy of the one found in the Soviet and [[MiG-15bis (Germany)|German]] tech trees, and performs identically to them. Having the powerful VK-1 engine and strong firepower, the MiG-15bis shines with its overall performance against a majority of jets that it faces, though it still requires attention to enemy missiles and strong trigger discipline for the limited ammunition onboard. Alternatively, in full uptiers, it can form the backmarker of the team rather than the tip of the spear, picking off distracted targets and being able to fight back against even some supersonic jets in close-in dogfights due to its incredible dogfighting performance for its speed and weight class, along with being a very small target to hit.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100M-43 bombs (200 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great acceleration
* Excellent climb rate
* Powerful armament: the 37 mm and 23 mm combination can shatter targets in a few well-placed hits
* Good manoeuvrability, thanks to its low wing loading
* Great service ceiling
* Good high-altitude performance compared to other jets at its BR
* Rockets can double as flares, which is useful in uptiers

'''Cons:'''

* Slow roll rate, especially at high speeds
* Control surfaces stiffen up at high speeds
* Cannons are hard to aim, due to different trajectories
* Low ammo count for cannons
* No air-to-air missiles
* Poor cockpit visibility in Simulator Battles
