== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In 1953-1954, there was multiple programs involving modifying the [[MiG-15bis]] into various other roles and specialities. One such variant was the MiG-15bis-ISH, a dedicated "Shturmovik", or ground attacker. For the ground attack modification, the MiG-15bis was given long wing-fence pylons on each wing, coupled with new experimental rocket launch rails that were angled downwards, allowing the MiG-15bis-ISH to carry a large quantity of bombs (for a MiG-15) or a lot of downwards angled rockets for ground attack runs.

Introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]] as a [[wt:en/news/5924-development-shop-jet-packs-en|premium pack]], the MiG-15bis-ISH is arguably the best Soviet MiG-15 in-game, being at the same battle rating as the normal [[MiG-15]], and lower than the tech tree [[MiG-15bis]], the bis-ISH has access not only to a lot more ground-striking ordnance, but the powerful engine of the MiG-15bis, which more than offsets the added weight and drag of the comically large wing pylons.

The MiG-15bis ISH was removed from sale after the 2019 [[wt:en/news/6464-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-en|Birthday sale]]. The {{PAGENAME}} has since been made temporarily available for purchase in-game ({{GE}}) during the [[wt:en/news/7279-special-day-of-the-russian-aerospace-forces-en|2021]] and [[wt:ru/news/15850-akciya-den-vvs-rossii-ru|2022]] "Day of the Russian Aerospace Forces" mini-events.

=== Offensive armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|N-37D (37 mm)|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 37 mm N-37D cannon, chin-mounted (40 rpg)
* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, chin-mounted (80 rpg = 160 total)

The MiG 15 bis ISH carries multiple offensive weapons which consist of two 23 mm cannons and a 37 mm cannon. There is limited ammo on both, so eliminate enemies on the first pass if possible.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|OFAB-100 (100 kg)|OFAB-250-270 (250 kg)|FAB-500M-54 (500 kg)}}
{{main|S-1of|S-5K|S-5M}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 6 x 100 kg OFAB-100 bombs (600 kg total)
* 4 x 250 kg OFAB-250-270 bombs (1,000 kg total)
* 2 x 500 kg FAB-500M-54 bombs (1,000 kg total)
* 48 x S-5K rockets
* 48 x S-5M rockets
* 8 x S-1of rockets

The MiG benefits from multiple suspended weapon payloads, consisting of six x 100 kg bombs, four x 250 kg bombs, two x 500 kg bombs, 8 x S-1of or 48 x S-5K/S-5M rockets, mounted on two external mounted pods. Note that the pods are mounted at a downward-facing angle. This aircraft carries no air-to-air weapons nor any type of decoy munitions.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MiG 15's main opponents are the same as most Soviet jets, mostly American and British jets, although some piston-driven aircraft will be a threat at low speeds. The MiG is not very good at turning at high speeds, as it loses speed very easily. If you intend to support your ground allies in any case, bombs are the better option. Rockets are only effective against light ground targets such as AA emplacements and aircraft on the ground. Try to avoid turning battles as the MiG is not exceptional, however, it is better than most Soviet aircraft at that battle rating. Being up-tiered is not good news since Tier 6 aircraft have some access to air-to-air missiles. Here avoiding aircraft in some situations is your best bet, that said the cannons, if aimed carefully will rip an aircraft to pieces, causing critical hits or sending them back to the hangar.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent climb rate and acceleration
* Above average manoeuvrability
* Powerful main armament, especially effective against bombers
* Ground strike capability
** Able to carry 8x [[S-1of]] HE or 48x [[S-5K]] HEAT rockets
** Ballistic computer for rockets
** Depressed direction results in the player less prone to crashing into trees or buildings

'''Cons:'''

* Somewhat slow roll rate
* Poor controllability due to compression at high Mach numbers (> Mach 0.9)
* Armament difficult to use (low velocities, low ammo and two different trajectories)
* Guns tend to spark a lot (the N-37 in particular), especially with stock belts
* Poor forward visibility in simulator, as a large canopy frame and the gunsight block the top and bottom view
* CCIP position may be obscured by the aircraft in third person
** The CCIP marker in cockpit view requires the player to move the pilot's head position fully up to see the impact point for the downward-launching rockets, effectively making the armoured glass frame block the view of what's ahead
** The computed impact point may be blocked by the instrument panel if the aircraft is flying too slowly or is manoeuvring aggressively

After World War II was over, the leaders of the USSR realized that they were behind the leading states of the world in the sphere of jet aircraft construction, most notably in the full-scale production of turbojet engines. Consequently, a delegation including the designers A. I. Mikoyan and V. Y. Klimov was sent to Great Britain towards the end of 1946. Their negotiations were successful, resulting in the purchase of two of the most advanced turbojet engines at that time: the Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.V and the Rolls-Royce Nene I/Nene II. The British consented to sell their newest strategic designs easily enough, since they believed that the Soviet industrial/technological apparatus could not handle the mass production of sophisticated assemblies. However, very soon that the Rolls-Royce engines were launched into full-scale Soviet production under the designations RD-500 and RD-45.

The emergence of the new engines led to the creation of Soviet jet fighters able to compete with the leading models of the world. In 1947, the Mikoyan Design Bureau started the development of a front line fighter with a Nene (RD-45) turbojet engine and an airtight cockpit: the I-310 (""S""). The first S-01 prototype aircraft made its first flight on December 30, 1947, and, after working on the test results, was launched into full-scale production in 1948 under the designation MiG-15. The plane's airframe was an all-metal monoplane configuration with mid-swept wings and empennage. Thus the MiG-15 became the first production swept-wing fighter.

The MiG-15 was equipped with a RD-45F single-shaft turbojet engine rated at 2,270 kg of thrust with a double-entry centrifugal compressor. The plane's armament included a 37 mm Nudelman N-37D cannon with 40 rounds and two 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23KM guns with 160 rounds in total. The cannons were mounted in the forward fuselage on a lowerable carriage. Two 100 kg or 50 kg bombs could be suspended under the wings. To increase its flight range, the aircraft could carry two external fuel tanks with a capacity ranging from 250 to 600 litres.

The MiG-15 fighter was notable for its simple and reliable structure, high flight and operating characteristics, and powerful armament. Its maximum speed, rate of climb, ceiling, and flight range were the best among Soviet fighters at the time and superior to many foreign aircraft, as well.

The first production MiG-15s with RD-45F engines began to leave the factory floor in early 1949. In 1950, more advanced MiG-15bis fighters replaced them in the factory assembly lines.
