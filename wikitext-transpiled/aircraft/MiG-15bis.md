== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the early '50s, a design proposal for an upgraded [[MiG-15]] was issued, titled the '''MiG-15bis''' (second). The primary upgrade was the new, indigenously developed engine. While the older Klimov RD-45 powering the original MiG-15 was great, it was a reverse-engineered copy of the British Rolls-Royce Nene and as such, had issues with quality and reliability due to the differences in metallurgy and production in the Soviet Union. As such, an in-house variant, named the VK-1, was developed to alleviate these issues, and was also given a larger combustion chamber and turbine, allowing greater induction and airflow in the engine. The MiG-15bis's new engine not only increased its dogfighting performance, but also its weight limits, allowing it to use newer unguided ground ordnance.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is one of the original Soviet top rank aircraft and was available even before the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. Nowadays, it serves as a further learning step from the previous [[MiG-9]] and [[MiG-15]], teaching players about advanced energy management techniques and trigger discipline, a skill required for almost all future Soviet jet fighters in the tech tree. Having the powerful VK-1 engine and strong firepower, the MiG-15bis shines with its overall performance against a majority of the jets it will face, though it still requires strong situational awareness to enemy missiles and utilization of strong trigger discipline and gun control for the tricky guns using a limited ammunition pool onboard. Alternatively, in full uptiers, it can form the backmarker of the team rather than the tip of the spear, picking off distracted targets and being able to fight back against even some supersonic jets in close-in dogfights. All in all, the MiG-15bis is a great upgrade over the baseline MiG-15, rewarding players who mastered and enjoyed the base model with a upgraded variant that is potent against threats it can face.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The MiG-15bis is an improved and definitive MiG-15 version, the main difference is the improved engine, the Klimov VK-1. Its level speed at sea level was increased by 26 km/h to 1,076 km/h, still marginally lower than many other jets like for example the F-86 series.
The other noticeable change is a huge improvement of thrust-to-weight ratio which increased the acceleration by ~10% and it also has a huge impact on its climb rate, it can reach up to 50 m/s at low altitude with full fuel tanks, making the MiG-15bis one of the best climbing planes compared to other planes at similar battle rating.
Like the previous version, it can not fly at max power for too long or it will start overheating. While decreasing the power to 95% or lower will cool it down for a moment, if you increase it back to 100% it will immediately start overheating again.

The manoeuvrability compared to the previous variant is basically the same, while this version is slightly worse at performing horizontal manoeuvres due to increased weight (by ~100 kg), it is now better at performing vertical loop and other similar manoeuvres because of the better engine. It struggles against other jets due to its overall poor handling characteristics (poor rudder authority at all speeds, poor roll rate at all speeds).
At high speed, it does not suffer as much from compressibility but it is still at best mediocre. The elevator and rudder controls remained the same, so the plane still locks up a lot after reaching transonic speeds. Other features stayed the same: airbrakes help with slowing the plane down when it locks up too much and flaps help significantly increase dogfighting capability at low and medium speeds.

When flying with simulator controls, it is very pleasant to fly: trimming is almost not required when the plane travels at high speed, insufficient roll rate can be improved by using the rudder, but that can also make it slow down. The plane can be stalled out even at high speed, and when above its critical angle of attack (AoA) it severely wing-stalls, throwing off your aim and/or your heading. Be very careful to not pull too much from the stick as to not reach this state, remember that it is one of the best rate-fighter of its tier, so it's best to pull a bit less to keep your speed and not wing-stall as you'll get into position within a few turns. Its improved roll rate (compared to the MiG-15) makes it easier to use against the planes it faces, but it's still less than its opposition

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 10 mm steel armour plates in front of the cockpit and behind the pilot's head rest.
* 6 mm steel armour under the pilot's seat.
* 64 mm bulletproof front windshield.
* Self-sealing fuel tanks behind the pilot and under the jet engine nozzle.
* Jet engine located in the rear of the aircraft, pilot seated in front.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

It is recommended to obtain the modifications in the following order: Compressor > New boosters > Offensive 37 mm > Wings repair > Engine > G-suit > New 37 mm cannons > Cover > Offensive 23 mm > New 23 mm cannons > Airframe > Fuselage repair > Suspended weapons

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|N-37D (37 mm)|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 37 mm N-37D cannon, chin-mounted (40 rpg)
* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, chin-mounted (80 rpg = 160 total)

In line with its originally designed role of bomber interception, the MiG-15bis is armed with three powerful nose-mounted autocannons. The 37 mm N-37D cannon is particularly noteworthy, as even a small number of hits are usually fatal to any aircraft unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end, with the twin 23 mm NR-23 cannons also being quite respectable in terms of lethality.

The trade-off is that these cannons do not have large ammunition reserves, especially compared to the American planes armed with heavy machine guns, and it is very easy to run out of ammunition without careful aim. In addition, the N-37D has a significantly lower muzzle velocity than the NR-23, with a more pronounced ballistic arc. This makes obtaining hits with both types of cannon at the same time quite challenging; using only the 37 mm or the 23 mm cannons at one time may be more efficient with regards to ammunition usage.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FAB-100M-43 (100 kg)|S-5K|S-5M|S-21}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100M-43 bombs (200 kg total)
* 16 x S-5K rockets
* 16 x S-5M rockets
* 2 x S-21 rockets

The MiG-15bis is capable of carrying up to 200 kg of bombs on underwing hardpoints. While this pales in comparison to the American or British fighter-bombers, it is enough for taking out isolated ground targets, if needed.

The S-5M HE rockets are most effective against light ground units, while the S-5K HEAT rockets are capable of penetrating the top armour of most vehicles.

The massive S-21 rocket has a considerable blast radius, and a single hit on a tank is usually fatal. The rocket may also be set with a distance fuse (up to 1,000 m), which can be very effective against large aircraft, such as bombers, or tightly bunched groups of smaller aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In-game, the MiG-15bis fulfils the same role as the MiG-15, primarily serving as an air superiority fighter and bomber interceptor. Armament is substandard in comparison to other countries, relying on low velocity weapons that are highly inaccurate, and situated below the fuselage, aggravating targeting angles during dogfights. It excels in vertical combat manoeuvres, taking advantage of its high thrust-to-weight ratio. The MiG-15bis also has a limited ground attack capability.

The MiG-15bis should be played like the MiG-15, using boom-and-zoom style attacks and keeping your energy high: speed is essential in jet battles. It wouldn't be a bad idea to try head-ons if you know your cannon's ballistics well. The 37 mm and 23 mm combo really help. The plane lacks in roll rate so you will have to watch out for other jets trying to reverse you.

Trigger discipline and good aim is important as you have limited ammunition and no access to air-to-air missiles. As with most other aircraft regardless of BR, carrying suspended armament improves ground attacking capabilities, but sacrifices much of the aircraft's acceleration, climb rate and maneuvrability.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent climb rate and acceleration
* Above average manoeuvrability
* Good performance at altitude compared to most opponents
* Powerful main armament, especially effective against bombers
* Ability to carry massive S-21 rockets, unlike the earlier [[MiG-15]]
* Amazing turn below 800 km/h (520 mph)
* G-Suit and New Boosters available through research, unlike the [[MiG-15]]

'''Cons:'''

* Somewhat slow roll rate
* Loss of manoeuvrability above Mach 0.9 due to compression
* Cannons have very a low muzzle velocity, making aiming at fast targets very hard
* Cannon main armament is mounted very low, and the different ballistics can make aiming even more difficult
* Limited ammunition capacity
* Stock guns have an important dispersion and stock belts tend to spark a lot
* Poor forward visibility in simulator: it has a large canopy frame and the gunsight obstructs the top and bottom

After World War II was over, the leaders of the USSR realized that they were behind the leading states of the world in the sphere of jet aircraft construction, most notably in the full-scale production of turbojet engines. Consequently, a delegation including the designers A. I. Mikoyan and V. Y. Klimov was sent to Great Britain towards the end of 1946. Their negotiations were successful, resulting in the purchase of two of the most advanced turbojet engines at that time: the Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.V and the Rolls-Royce Nene I/Nene II. The British consented to sell their newest strategic designs easily enough, since they believed that the Soviet industrial/technological apparatus could not handle the mass production of sophisticated assemblies. However, very soon that the Rolls-Royce engines were launched into full-scale Soviet production under the designations RD-500 and RD-45.

The emergence of the new engines led to the creation of Soviet jet fighters able to compete with the leading models of the world. In 1947, the Mikoyan Design Bureau started the development of a front line fighter with a Nene (RD-45) turbojet engine and an airtight cockpit: the I-310 ("S"). The first S-01 prototype aircraft made its first flight on December 30, 1947, and, after working on the test results, was launched into full-scale production in 1948 under the designation MiG-15. The plane's airframe was an all-metal monoplane configuration with mid-swept wings and empennage. Thus the MiG-15 became the first production swept-wing fighter.

The MiG-15 was equipped with a RD-45F single-shaft turbojet engine rated at 2,270 kg of thrust with a double-entry centrifugal compressor. The plane's armament included a 37mm Nudelman N-37D cannon with 40 rounds and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23KM guns with 160 rounds in total. The cannons were mounted in the forward fuselage on a lowerable carriage. Two 100 kg or 50 kg bombs could be suspended under the wings. To increase its flight range, the aircraft could carry two external fuel tanks with a capacity ranging from 250 to 600 litres.

The MiG-15 fighter was notable for its simple and reliable structure, high flight and operating characteristics, and powerful armament. Its maximum speed, rate of climb, ceiling, and flight range were the best among Soviet fighters at the time and superior to many foreign aircraft, as well.

The first production MiG-15s with RD-45F engines began to leave the factory floor in early 1949. In 1950, more advanced MiG-15bis fighters replaced them in the factory assembly lines.
