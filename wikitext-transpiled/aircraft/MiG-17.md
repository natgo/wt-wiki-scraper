== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 "Royal Armour"]]. It is known by many names in the world, with a NATO reporting name of ''Fresco'', the Chinese name [[J-4|''Shenyang J-5 (歼-5)'']], Czechoslovak ''S-104'' and the Polish name ''PZL-Mielec Lim-5''.

Building off of the successful [[MiG-15]], the {{PAGENAME}} improves performance and handling to be better able to tolerate the higher speeds common in jet combat.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The MiG-17 is a high-subsonic fighter aircraft, it retained the Klimov VK-1 engine that was used by its predecessor, the MiG-15bis. Although the plane is heavier, its level speed performance is slightly improved due to aerodynamic improvements such as a new thinner and more highly swept wing and tailplane. The level speed at sea level is 1,121 km/h, very close to its structural speed limit and over 40 km/h higher than the MiG-15, that makes it very comparable with other jets like the F-86F series.
The climb rate performance remained the same: with full fuel tanks it is 50 m/s at very low altitude and 35 m/s above 5,000 m altitude, which puts it on par with the Sabre series but is significantly worse than the British Hawker Hunter F.1 or French Super Mystère B2 with an afterburner that can get to 6,000 m altitude in over two minutes. Since the MiG-17 is heavier its thrust to weight ratio is decreased and it affects its acceleration at low and medium speeds, but at higher speed due to lower drag and more swept wings it is slightly better.
Prolonged usage of maximum power in this plane may cause its engine to overheat after 10 minutes of flight, when the plane is cruising and not in any combat situation it is recommended to reduce it to 95% or 90% which does not have any operation limit.

The dogfighting capabilities are very close to its precursor, while it is over 200 kg heavier its wing area is also increased, so the wing loading is slightly lower, at low and medium speed its turn rate is slightly worse, but once the plane reaches 750 km/h it gets better. However it still suffers to some extent from compressibility issues near transonic speed. The MiG-17 is still a very dangerous foe to the Sabre series and many other jet fighters, one of its main strengths is performance in vertical manoeuvres. It is also capable of outturning the Sabre, the Super Mystère or Hunter so facing them should not be a problem.
Its roll rate is practically the same as the MiG-15bis, mediocre at low and medium speed and it can get very bad above 900 km/h. It is very close to 100 °/s at 600 km/h IAS and lowers to ~50 °/s upon reaching 900 km/h IAS.
The airbrake is the same: it can help slow down to the speed range where its turn rate is the best. Flaps also have the same speed limit, over 600 km/h in take-off position and 450 km/h for landing, which is quite high, just like its landing gear, which can come very handy when the plane is landing after having taken some damage.

With full-real controls it is very pleasant to fly, does not have any stability issues at any speed and it is very easy to aim. Its nose will keep dropping until it reaches 850 km/h IAS so it might need some positive pitch trimming below that speed, above that it should be trimmed from -1% to 3%, depending on how fast it is.
The stalling characteristics are quite forgiving, after reaching the maximum angle of attack it will not start rolling to any side immediately, but its speed will keep decreasing very fast.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->[[File:MiG-17 Armour Layout.png|thumb|Armour layout for the MiG-17]]

* 60 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit front.

* 16 mm Steel plates behind the pilot.
* 10 mm Steel plate in the nose.

This armour layout lets the pilot be secured while leaving the tail and wings unprotected.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

It is recommended to prioritize performance modification and 37 mm belts over other modifications.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|N-37D (37 mm)|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 37 mm N-37D cannon, nose-mounted (40 rpg)
* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, nose-mounted (80 rpg = 160 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|OFAB-250sv (250 kg)|S-5K|S-5M|S-21}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (500 kg total)
* 16 x S-5K rockets
* 16 x S-5M rockets
* 2 x S-21 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The MiG-17 should be played like its predecessors, the MiG-15s. In 1v1 situations, the -17 will easily win if played correctly, and due to its superior flight characteristics it is easier to win fights against multiple enemies. You have the upper hand in the initial dogfight, as your great turn will allow you to get on their 6 without much difficulty. However, in a prolonged engagement the chances of you losing increase due to your heavier weight and good, yet not spectacular energy retention. If the player is uncomfortable with dogfighting, the MiG-17 can also be a very effective boom-and-zoom fighter.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent acceleration and speed in dives
* Excellent climb rate, almost same as the [[MiG-15bis]]
* Guns will tear even the heaviest of bombers into shreds with an accurate burst
* Very good manoeuvrability at low to medium speeds
* More manoeuvrable at high speeds than the MiG-15s
* Excellent energy retention, but still loses some speed when turning hard
* If you airbrake enemies should struggle to make you overshoot
* Performs well at altitude when compared to aircraft such as the F-86F Sabres and the Hunter F.1
* Can safely reach a speed of 1,150 km/h (IAS) and up to Mach 1.10 when diving
* Hard to break wings in a turn without rolling
* Very similar to the [[MiG-15bis]], meaning similar playstyles

'''Cons:'''

* Roll rate is not on par with others in this tier
* Armament difficult to use (low velocities, low ammo and two different trajectories)
* Mediocre acceleration in speeds between 800 - 1,100 km/h
* Acceleration and energy retention makes defensive fighting harder as you might overshoot targets
* Poor forward visibility in Simulator, as a large canopy frame and the gunsight block the top and bottom
* Lacks radar rangefinder for the gyro sight
* Engine eventually might overheat when operated over 96% throttle
* Does not handle damage very well

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Korean war showed that the MiG-15 and [[MiG-15bis]] fighters were able to battle any aerial opponent at least on equal terms. The MiG-17 was a further development of the MiG-15 design that had proven itself so well. It was decided to increase the aircraft's speed by increasing the sweep of the wing and the fuselage being lengthened to maintain the centre of gravity. The [[MiG-15]] and MiG-17 show almost no differences at first glance. The prototype of the MiG-17 was even called the MiG-15bis45. However, only the frontal parts of the fuselage are the same, from the air intake to the wing, if you don't count the landing headlight that had been moved to the left wing and some minor details.

These aircraft are different in every other way. It is easy to see the main differences when you look from above. By comparing the side profiles, you can see that in addition to the difference in fuselage length there are differences in the tail fin and an additional ventral fin which allows you to immediately tell the MiG-17 apart from the MiG-15. The upper part of the fins and the rudders of the aircraft are different, the juncture between the fin and the stabilizer fin also differs, but this can only be seen close up. The wing sweep of the stabilizer fin was also increased and there were also changes to elevators. The air brakes also differ in shape and size. The depth of the housing was decreased, so a cigar-shaped cowl was created to hide the cylinder. There were very significant changes to the wing. Apart from an increased wing sweep, a leading edge break appeared and the tips became rounder, which helps differentiate the aircraft when looking at them from above or below. While the MiG-15 had two aerodynamic ridges on the top surface of its wings, the MiG-17 had three.

The change in the shape of the wing led to appropriate changes in the construction of the flaps. The new geometry of the main landing gear legs required for the cover to be altered. The structure of the canopy also saw some changes. However, the first versions of the MiG-17 had the same canopies as the [[MiG-15bis]]. Apart from changes to the design of the canopy framing (which is not actually that noticeable from afar), a rear-view mirror was introduced that would allow the aircraft to be recognized from further away. There were no significant changes to the cockpit. Overall, the MiG-17 looks even more aesthetically pleasing and streamlined than its predecessor.
