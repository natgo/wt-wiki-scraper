== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The MiG-19 (NATO Code: Farmer) was a Soviet jet designed during the early 1950s. It was a key component of the Soviet Union's air defense plan and served as a vital complement to fighter-interceptor duties. The MiG-19 was known to be a formidable foe in aerial combat due to its reputation for impressive speed, being the first Soviet-produced aircraft to reach supersonic speeds in level flight, and its respectable manoeuvrability. Although the majority of its service in the Soviet Union was spent on routine interceptions, it is best known for its role in the Vietnam War. As its legacy grew, the MiG-19 underwent continuous refinement, giving rise to a diverse range of variants that extended its service life. Among these was the '''{{Specs|name}}''', a single MiG-19P modified to carry the [[R-3S]] "Atoll" missiles, which showcased the aircraft's adaptability and ingenuity.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]] and was one of the first three jets to feature guided air-to-air missiles, alongside the [[F-100D]] and the [[Javelin F.(A.W.) Mk.9]]. In the game, it is best known for its manoeuvrability and speed, which allow it to win against many other aircraft in energy fights. However, amidst its impressive capabilities, it remains crucial to note that the {{Specs|name}}'s lack of countermeasures makes it vulnerable to enemy missile attacks, and astute situational awareness is crucial for its survival.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The main advantages of the MiG-19PT are its exceptional acceleration, great energy retention in a straight line and the very strong climb rate. Aside from the top speed, the aircraft has the raw performance to at least keep up with more modern jets.

However, the plane is weighed down by its somewhat inferior manoeuvring energy retention, bad low speed manoeuvrability and poor high speed handling. Compression at high Mach numbers slows the roll rate significantly and makes the rudder nearly entirely unresponsive, though MiG-19PT generally has a very responsive elevator. Despite how the acceleration can make up for it, be careful not to turn excessively, as that will bleed much speed due to the poor manoeuvring energy retention.

The performance of the plane doesn't suffer too much when it's stock. It can still out accelerate Phantoms and climb from sea level at 1,100 km/h up to 10 km in a single zoom climb without any modifications.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 16 mm steel behind the radar
* 60 mm bulletproof glass in front of the cockpit
* 10 mm of steel on the pilot's seat
* 25 mm of steel on headrest

The MiG-19, like most jets, cannot fly well with damage. However, the wing spars can be somewhat sturdy, able to absorb several 20 mm or 12.7 mm rounds, perhaps allowing you to return to the airfield safely to repair. One benefit of the MiG is that the elevators are separate to each other in the damage model, and therefore a hit to the tail causing an elevator loss isn't the end of the world, since the remaining one is good enough to continue the fight. The elevators can also act as damage absorbers, taking the brunt of otherwise lethal damage. Occasionally, you may find that a missile has struck the plane, blowing off an elevator but leaving the plane still flyable. Another point to note is that loss of oil in either engine will rapidly cause engine failure, so it is best to return to base ASAP when damaged.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|NR-30 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm NR-30 cannons, wing-mounted (70 rpg = 140 total)

The MiG-19 carries two 30 mm NR-30 cannons, mounted in the wing roots. Each gun has 70 rounds of ammunition, making a total of 140 rounds. The NR-30 cannons are very fast firing so this is not much ammo, and you can't afford to spray. The guns however are extremely powerful, and only a couple of rounds hitting an enemy aircraft will severely cripple them, if not outright destroy them. The shell velocity is very high and you don't need much lead to hit a target.

The recommended belts for this aircraft are Ground Targets, they're more reliable than the Air Target belts and tend to take off wings and large sections, and destroy engines with one hit, in comparison to the air target belts which tend to spark or just damage external modules. The ground belts contain APHE rounds with 48 mm of penetration, but it is not really worth going for ground targets as the limited ammunition and high speed of the aircraft makes it very difficult to hit or destroy anything.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x R-3S missiles
* 32 x S-5K rockets
* 2 x 100 kg OFAB-100 bombs (200 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (500 kg total)
{{Navigation-End}}

The MiG-19PT can carry two heat seeking R-3S air to air missiles on under-wing pylons. The missiles have a 10G overload with 8.8 kg TNT explosive equivalent, which is enough to nearly guarantee a downed enemy aircraft if they hit. They travel at a speed of 1,000 m/s which is average for air to air missiles. The ideal use-case for the missiles is for a very low-speed or distracted enemy, as it is very easy to dodge an R3S.

The missiles are IR guided, try to refrain from firing at a target with friendlies in front of you, as the missile may switch onto a friendly. Enemies flying near the sun are also poor targets. It is not recommended to fire at any target pulling anything more than a light turn, since the missile will just lose track and miss.

Whilst it is possible to lock onto a prop aircraft with the R-3S, you usually have to be at nearly point blank range for the missile to lock on, so you may as well use your guns instead.

Despite the below-average accuracy of the S-5K rockets, these rockets can find success with the speedy characteristics of the MiG-19PT to combat ground vehicles. These rockets are best used in hit-and-run tactics. Half or all of the rockets should be fired in a single volley to increase the chance of a hit, and then return-to-base to rearm. It is recommended to attack at a steep angle so the rockets has a better chance to hit the roof of a tank, which are not well-protected. It is also recommended to engage an attack on the rear of a tank.

The MiG-19PT can be an excellent bomber at low altitudes for its speed allows to escape a 0.5 second time fuze with relative ease at high speeds and possibly avoiding SPAAs at low altitude.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Since the MiG-19PT has great vertical energy retention and acceleration, you should use this to your advantage. Taking the enemies vertical is the best move as they will quickly lose energy while you can maintain it. The airbrake is also a very effective tool, allowing you to stay behind someone if they try to force you to overshoot and the plane also rolls well enough that you can engage in rolling scissors if need be.

It is recommended to avoid throttling down the engine as it has an extremely long spool time until it produces max thrust and this will let your opponent get away from you while you struggle to accelerate.

=== Radars ===
{{main|RP-5}}

The MiG-19PT is equipped with an [[RP-5]] search and tracking radar. One radar antenna is located in the centre of the air intake, while the other (and the main body of the radar) is located in the nose of the aircraft, above the intake.

After taking its first flight in 1954, the MiG-19 became a worldwide sensation – it was the first mass-produced aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier in horizontal flight after taking off from the ground. Although it was the most advanced combat aircraft of its day, the MiG-19 also had certain problems with manoeuvrability, and certain other improvements also took shape that were then used in the upgraded versions of the MiG-19. The fighter received an all-movable stabilizer that significantly improved its flight characteristics, enhanced control and braking systems, and new, more powerful 30 mm guns instead of 23 mm guns. One of the most interesting modifications was the MiG-19PT fighter-interceptor, which was developed especially for the installation of K-13 (P-3C) air-to-air missiles. This missile was strongly influenced by the extremely successful American Sidewinder, models of which the Soviet Union received from China. The MiG-19PT's flight tests were successfully completed in 1964. The K-13 missile was then used on an entire series of combat aircraft and remained in active use until the end of the 80s. The MiG-19 itself was modernized several times and participated in many armed conflicts. Over 2,000 MiG-19s were manufactured in the USSR, and even more MiGs were manufactured in China: over 4,500 units.
