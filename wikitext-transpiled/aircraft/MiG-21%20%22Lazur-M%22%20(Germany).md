== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Izdeliye [Product] 75A; NATO "Fishbed-L") is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

A version of the [[MiG-21bis]] with a homeland air-defense datalink system (Lazur-M); although the name may sound fancy, the jet itself is essentially yet another MiG-21bis. Like the other variants in East German and Soviet service, it is equipped with a powerful engine and varieties of weaponry for different occasions, capable of both intensive air-intercept missions or simple ground-attacking missions with unguided weapons.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful Tumansky R-25 engine with high acceleration, climb rate, and power-weight ratio
* Relatively large air-to-air payload for its tier
* All-aspect IR AAMs
* Varieties of air-to-air/ground weapons
* Improved overall performance to previous Fishbeds

'''Cons:'''

* Delta wing causes massive speed bleed in turns
* The R-25 engine has rather high fuel consumption at afterburning
* Control surfaces lock at higher speeds

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The "Lazur-M" (Лазурь-М; Azure-M), also known by its equipment name ARL-SM, was a communication equipment for PVO (Air-Defense Force) jets as part of their land-based air-defense system "Dozduh-1" (Воздух-1; Air-1). Lazur-M was first installed on the MiG-21S and retained on later models of the MiG-21 including the MiG-21bis; these were the base model of earlier MiG-21bis exported to Warsaw Pact countries, and the LSK (East German Air Force) was one of the users. Later deliveries were equipped with the Polyot ILS system (producing the [[MiG-21bis-SAU (Germany)|MiG-21bis-SAU]]; ''Sistema Avtomaticheskovo Upravleniya'', Automatic Landing System).

The default livery in game is Red 872 (build no. 75033151) of JG (Jagdfliegergeschwader)-8, 1.LVD based in Neuhardenberg Marxwalde Airfield (now a regional airport) near Berlin. This aircraft was then numbered 24-27 of Luftwaffe and decommissioned on German Unification Day, and later scrapped in Dresden.<ref>Högel, Bianca. “Die Mig-21 in DER DDR.” DDR MiG-21 Lasur, n.d. https://www.biancahoegel.de/flug/typen/ru/mig/mig-21lazur-ddr.html.</ref>
