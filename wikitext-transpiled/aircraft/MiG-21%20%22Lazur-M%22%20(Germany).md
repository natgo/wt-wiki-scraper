== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->In the mid 1970s, the East German Airforce would start recieving their first [[MiG-21bis]] aircraft, to update their fighter-interceptor fleet from the aging [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MiG-21MF]]<nowiki/>s and PFMs. East Germany would recieve exactly 46 of the type, with 14 of them being the "Fishbed-L" variant, equipped with the Lazur-M GCI (Ground Controlled Intercept) guidance system. The other 32 would be the "Fishbed-N" variant, equipped with the Polyot-OI guidance system instead. To diffrenciate the two variants, the aircraft recieved unique names in East German service, being called the '''MiG-21bis Lazur-M''' and the [[MiG-21bis-SAU (Germany)|MiG-21bis-SAU]] respectively.

Introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as the first Rank 7 pack premium for the German tech tree, the '''{{Specs|name}}''' may sound like it has a fancy name, but is virtually identical to its tech tree brother, the [[MiG-21bis-SAU (Germany)|MiG-21bis-SAU]], with the only difference between these aircraft being the type of guidance system used, which has no effect on the plane or its gameplay in War Thunder. Like its tech tree copy, the MiG-21bis Lazur still very much plays as you would except from the Fishbed family; that being the ability to hit hard and fast against unsuspecting targets, and punishing most aircraft that decide to dogfight you at high speeds. The Lazur-M, just as with the other Fishbeds of this battle rating, relies alot more on its great flight performance and strong engine providing quick acceleration to win its engagements, rather than relying on its avionics, radar, and missile selection, which are underwhelming compared to its adversaries at this tier.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Using the speed of the MiG-21's interceptor role and design is key to success in this aircraft. Utilising a "Boom-and-Zoom" playstyle is most effective, however the MiG-21 does have an ace up its sleeve: it turns remarkably well, you can confidentially turn with F-5 Tigers in it. However, the drawback of having small wings is that you lose a lot of your energy when turning, quite like the F-5. In short, play mainly as a Boom-and-Zoom fighter, but use your AoA (Angle of attack in relation to airflow/direction) to your advantage in those tight situations. Always be wary of F-5's as they can pose a threat to your playstyle as they match it and as per usual keep an eye out for those missiles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful Tumansky R-25 engine with high acceleration, climb rate, and power-to-weight ratio
* Relatively large air-to-air payload for its tier
* All-aspect IR AAMs
* Varieties of air-to-air/ground weapons
* Improved overall performance to previous Fishbeds

'''Cons:'''

* Delta wing causes massive speed bleed in turns
* The R-25 engine has rather high fuel consumption at afterburning
* Control surfaces lock at higher speeds

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The "Lazur-M" (Лазурь-М; Azure-M), also known by its equipment name ARL-SM, was a communication equipment for PVO (Air-Defense Force) jets as part of their land-based air-defense system "Dozduh-1" (Воздух-1; Air-1). Lazur-M was first installed on the MiG-21S and retained on later models of the MiG-21 including the MiG-21bis; these were the base model of earlier MiG-21bis exported to Warsaw Pact countries, and the LSK (East German Air Force) was one of the users. Later deliveries were equipped with the Polyot ILS system (producing the [[MiG-21bis-SAU (Germany)|MiG-21bis-SAU]]; ''Sistema Avtomaticheskovo Upravleniya'', Automatic Landing System).

The default livery in game is Red 872 (build no. 75033151) of JG (Jagdfliegergeschwader)-8, 1.LVD based in Neuhardenberg Marxwalde Airfield (now a regional airport) near Berlin. This aircraft was then numbered 24-27 of Luftwaffe and decommissioned on German Unification Day, and later scrapped in Dresden.<ref>Högel, Bianca. "Die Mig-21 in DER DDR."
