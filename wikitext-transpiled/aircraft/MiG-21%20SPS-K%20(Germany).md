== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the 1960s and '70s, East Germany had modified their MiG-21PFs into a new standard, which they indigenously called the MiG-21PFM (not to be confused with the Soviet designated [[MiG-21PFM]], a heavily upgraded MiG-21PF using the second-generation MiG-21 body style). However, a problem quickly arose when the East German air force acquired the Soviet designated PFMs, as these planes were vastly different than the upgraded PFs sharing the same name. To avoid further confusion, all Soviet designated MiG-21PFMs in German service would be re-designated into the MiG-21SPS. However, yet again, a naming convention conundrum arose when the later variant of the Soviet MiG-21PFM (''Izdelyie 94A'') entered service, with the biggest change being the ability to carry a [[GSh-23L (23 mm)|GSh-23]] gunpod on the underbelly. To account for the new variant again, the Germans re-designated this variant into the MiG-21SPS-K, with the K standing for ''Kanone'' to denote its ability to take a cannon pod.

Introduced as a premium pack in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]], the MiG-21SPS-K takes on an entirely new playstyle for the [[MiG-21 (Family)|Fishbed family]], completely departing from the high-speed, high AoA hit and run tactics of previous aircraft due to its loadouts. Due to not having a real built-in gun, this aircraft is very reliant on its IR-guided [[R-60]] and [[R-13M1]] and radar-guided [[R-3R]] air-to-air missile selection. However, due to being a MiG-21PFM airframe, it is limited to two hardpoints only, meaning the player can only take two missiles, so its best to choose wisely depending on the map and the Battle Rating of that match. The player can also choose between either a GSh-23 gunpod, or a SPS-141 countermeasures pod on the center pylon. Overall, the SPS-K is a unique premium as it differs greatly from the usual MiG-21's gameplay loop, having to rely a lot more on its ordnance and tools than its flight performance (which as with other MiG-21s, is very good as well).

The MiG-21 SPS-K was removed from the Gaijin store at the end of the [[wt:en/news/8225-shop-may-sale-in-the-gaijin-store-en|2023 May Sale]]. It was made available briefly to purchase with Golden Eagles {{GE}} during the [[wt:en/news/8324-special-the-mig-21-sps-k-returns-to-celebrate-the-mig-21-s-first-flight-en|2023 "MiG-21's First Flight" celebration]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The aircraft gets 60 mm bulletproof glass in front of the pilot and 10 mm of steel behind the pilot, making it more survivable in head-on attacks. Even with the bulletproof glass, the pilot isn't immune to any enemy fire. The plane gets self-sealing fuel tanks in the wings and over the engine.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Has access to R-3R, R-3S, R-13M1, and R-60 air-to-air missiles
* Decent radar to slave R-60s for easier target locking
* In a downtier, it can dominate with its gun and flight characteristics
* Quick plane with good speed for its br
* Decent manoeuvrability at high speed
* Ballistic computer for rockets, making it good for quick attack runs on ground targets

'''Cons:'''

* Bad energy retention in turns
* Poor acceleration making to plane hard to fly in turnfights
* Has to give up the gun for flare/chaff pod
* Hard to make use out of in uptier matches
* RWR is only working in the rear, not all around
* Gun runs out of ammo quickly due to high rate of fire and low ammunition storage

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The MiG-21 SPS (also MiG-21 PFS) was a subvariant of MiG-21 PF. The acronym SPS comes from "сдув пограничного слоя" ("sduv pogranichnogo sloya") which means "blown flaps". For this, the engine was modified and received a new name R-11F2S-300, this engine redirected some air from the compressor to the flaps. The military wanted it to be able to take off from unpaved airfields, and these modifications shortened the takeoff run to 480 m on average and reduced the landing speed to 240 km/h. Two SPRD-99 (СПРД-99) boosters could be installed to shorten the takeoff run even more. It was mass-produced from 1961 to 1965.
