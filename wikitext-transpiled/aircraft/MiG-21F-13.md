== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Fishbed-C) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]].

After the Korean War, nations came out with various aircraft which would out-fly opposing aircraft, especially in a dogfight. The U.S. introduced the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter while European nations, France, England and Sweden rolled out the Dassault Mirage F-1, Mirage III, English Electric Lightning, Hawker Hunter and the Saab Draken. At this time the Soviet Union was working on further developing the twin-engine MiG-19 but realized what it actually needed was a fast, single-engine light-weight fighter in what ultimately became the most highly produced supersonic fighter in the world, used by over 60 countries.

The MiG-21-F13 gives a gameplay preview of what the latter Soviet [[MiG-21 (Family)]] will provide in raw flight performance. The flight performance and its playstyle dynamics will be the most significant aspect of the aircraft, as the armaments are quite reduced and underachieving in many regards. Simply serving as a fighter, the F-13 could perhaps be underestimated by the lack of firepower when compared to Western aircraft, but this underappreciation can prove wrong if flown by dexterous players.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Due to the {{PAGENAME}} being an interceptor fighter, its main purpose is to interdict enemy aircraft. For this purpose, a jet fighter should meet certain criteria such as being light-weight, fast, aerodynamic and cheap to build and maintain. The {{PAGENAME}} fits all of these criteria to a tee. Sitting at a take-off weight of 9.5 tons and an afterburner thrust output from the R-11F-300 jet engine of 5,480 kgf, the MiG was a rocket compared to other contemporary fighters/interceptor aircraft. The closest comparable aircraft in-game are the Hunter F 1, Hunter F.6 and the Super Mystere B2. Pound for pound and thrust for thrust, the Hunter F 1 is the closest with a take-off weight of 9.5 tons and power output from a Rolls-Royce Avon Mk. 113 engine with 3,188 kgf, however, the final thrust output was no contest with the {{PAGENAME}} able to fly 1,000 km/h faster than the Hunter at top speed.
[[File:Mig 21 wtwallpaper 003.jpg|350x350px|thumb|right|Upper view of a {{PAGENAME}}.]]
Horizontal turning manoeuvrability in the MiG, for the most part, is non-existent. Due to the shape of the wings and the aerodynamics of the entire aircraft, it is built mostly for high-speed low-drag in a straight flight and that becomes apparent when it enters into a manoeuvre or a extended turn where it begins to bleed speed at a horrendous rate. With no adjustment to the throttle, a {{PAGENAME}} can drop from 1,000 km/h to 600 - 700 km/h just by making a turn or manoeuvring from flying in a straight line. MiG pilots must take into account when they attempt evasive manoeuvres after a missile is fired at them as doing so they may avoid the missile, but they may also end up flying under 700 km/h which is a bad place to be and can be difficult to return from if there is no room to dive to build up speed. The best bet to use the {{PAGENAME}} is up at higher altitudes where the jet flies faster and has room to dive if the speed needs to be built up after turning or manoeuvring.

While the {{PAGENAME}} can be outfitted with 250 kg or 500 kg bombs, adding the extra weight impacts this fighter even more. With the bombs placed on under-wing pylons, it decreases the roll-rate of the aircraft having that weight away from the centre of the aircraft (or in comparison to a clean aircraft – without bombs). Bombs are an option for the aircraft, however, due to needing to maintain speeds above 700 km/h using the MiG as a bomber is less effective and can expose this aircraft to other fighters which prey on low and slow aircraft.

The strength of the aircraft is its speed in a straight line whether in a climb, level flight or a dive, however, when it turns at all, it haemorrhages its energy and when it gets below 700 km/h, it is difficult to get back up to speed without diving to make up that speed. When caught near the ground and going slow will be extremely frustrating for a MiG-21 pilot.

Some characteristics to remember for Simulator battles:

* Abnormally strong up-righting torque (for a jet) can be troublesome when aiming
* Negative pitch stability above 500 km/h
* Deep-stalled flat-spinning MiG-21s cannot recover from spin
* Rapid energy bleeding can allow you to go from Mach 1 to landing speeds in a single hard 90 degree turn with trimming controls, allowing for rapid base return and landings
* Bubble canopy allows excellent peripheral vision; nothing hindering the line of sight
* Does not spin easily in a positive G-load stall
* Stable unstalled inverted spin with awkward recovery technique for joystick pilots

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

;Armour

* 16 mm Steel – behind the pilot's seat
* 25 mm Steel – pilot's headrest
* 65 mm Bulletproof glass – forward canopy windscreen

Not much thought was put into protecting the aircraft as it was relatively cheap and easy to build and maintain. However, protections were put in place for the pilot which on the other hand was a valuable asset. Protective steel behind the seat and pilot's headrest along with the 65 mm bulletproof glass helped protect the pilot from defensive fire coming from bomber turrets or from smaller calibre guns found on many Western fighters of the time.

Due to its speed and limited weapon load-out, further protections for the aircraft's critical component were not necessary and thus left off the aircraft to allow for its light-weight and quick intercept capability.

=== Offensive armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|NR-30 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 30 mm NR-30 cannon, nose-mounted (60 rpg)

The {{PAGENAME}} has been outfitted with a single 30 mm Nudelman-Rikhter NR-30 cannon. This gun is a large enough calibre to do some serious damage, however, this cannon only houses 60 rounds of ammunition. While the small ammunition pool appears to be a negative point to the aircraft, minimizing weight is necessary to ensure this aircraft can intercept inbound enemy aircraft. Trigger control is a fundamental skill when attacking aircraft, similarly to many previous Soviet aircraft on the previous early ranks.

=== Suspended armament ===

* Without load
* 2 x R-3S missiles
* 32 x S-5K rockets
* 2 x S-24 rockets
* 2 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (500 kg total)

;Air-to-air combat armament

In conjunction with its 30 mm NR-30 autocannon, it can also be outfitted with two additional air-to-air combat options. First is the R-3S air-to-air missiles of which only two are allocated at a time. When on the tail of an enemy aircraft there are two tones which will be emitted when attempting a missile lock, the first tone is the system searching for a target, once the target is locked onto, the tone will noticeably change. Once changed to the second tone, the missile can be fired. An enemy fighter which is paying attention to any notifications for an inbound missile does have a chance to avoid the missile, however, the longer they wait to initiate, the harder it will be for them to avoid being hit by the missile.

Secondary air-to-air armament comes in the package of 32 S-5K unguided rockets. Though less than accurate when fired off singly, salvos of these rockets will increase the chance that at least one or two rockets may hit the intended target. This ordnance is difficult to use against faster fighters, however, it may be ideal to utilise against slower bombers which may have a more difficult time out flying or outmanoeuvring these rockets.

;Ground attack armament

The {{PAGENAME}} can carry ordnance which is more specifically used for ground attack than aerial attack. Two options for rockets are available, the 32 x S-5K rockets already mentioned in the air-to-air combat section and the 2 x S-24 240 mm unguided rockets. The S-5K rockets can be used to great effect on anti-aircraft artillery, lightly armoured vehicles and aircraft landing, taking-off or parked on runways waiting for repairs or reloading. Since the S-5K is unguided and therefore not highly accurate, especially being launched from the {{PAGENAME}} and low altitudes, it is best to launch large salvos at the intended targets to increase the chances a hit is made. The S-24 rocket is just over two metres long and therefore only two can be outfitted on the aircraft. This rocket has its similarities to the U.S. unguided rocket the [[Tiny Tim]]. These larger rockets pack a punch and can be used for enemies on the ground clustered together, harder targets such as medium and heavy tanks, reinforced pillboxes and can even whittle away at the enemy bases.

A final ground attack option is to outfit bombs to the aircraft in either total weight of 500 kg or 1,000 kg. Either 250 kg or 500 kg bombs can be mounted to underwing pylons to be used on ground targets, however, while these are attached to the aircraft, its overall speed and manoeuvrability will suffer. Bombing with the {{PAGENAME}} can be a bit of a challenge without a bombsight or trying to hit a target while in a dive. Attempting a horizontal attack reduces the overall speed of the aircraft and makes it an easier target for enemy fighters waiting to pounce.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} was designed to be a fighter-interceptor and thus all of its design features shape it into virtually a missile with a cockpit. This aircraft wasn't designed to carry the load the [[F-4C]], [[G.91 YS]] or the [[Super Mystere B2]], but it was built for speed and to bring along the minimal amount of armament to do its job.

'''Air defence role'''

As a fighter-interceptor, the {{PAGENAME}} needed to get from Point A (the airbase) to Point B (the inbound enemy aircraft) in the shortest amount of time possible, shoot it and return to base to get ready for the next one. This jet can remain fast if it is flying in a straight line, however do not try to sustain dogfights in it. As it still has a high AoA, meaning it bleeds a good amount of speed in hard turns. The {{PAGENAME}} can be outfitted with air-to-air ordnance to support this fighting tactic or it can also load up on ground-attack ordnance which can inflict some damage. Though payload is available, this is not a strong suit for this aircraft.
[[File:MiG-21_kohler_001.jpg|325x325px|thumb|right|The {{PAGENAME}} in an aggressive power-climb ready to intercept.]]
The best use of this aircraft is to utilise its excellent speed and rate of climb and gain altitude and begin to level off when you are either at bomber altitude or just above any enemy fighters flying around. It is here you can use the great [[Boom & Zoom]] qualities of the aircraft and select a target and begin to dive on it. It is during this phase when you can attempt to get a lock with the R-3S air-to-air missiles and launch it or you can strafe any unwary targets with the 30 mm NR-30 autocannon. Extremely short bursts are a must in order to conserve ammunition (only 60 rounds total), but this powerful gun only needs one or two good shots to remove a wing, take out a pilot or disable an engine.

Once shots have been taken, regardless if they hit or missed, engage the afterburner and return to higher altitudes and set up for another Boom & Zoom run. [[Boom & Run]] techniques also work in that you can use the phenomenal speed of the {{PAGENAME}} to outrun just about any aircraft on the map (however beware of the [[F-4C]] which can keep pace if not outrun the {{PAGENAME}}).

The R-3S missiles can be a challenge to get used to, so newer pilots may elect to outfit the S-5K rockets and use them to go after bombers or large fighters. With only 60 rounds of 30 mm cannon ammunition, trigger control is a must or else you will be waiting often for a reload timer to count down or will be frequently returning to base to reload.

'''Ground attack role'''

Options are available to use this aircraft in the role of ground-attack, however, this may be an extreme challenge, especially to any novice fighter jet pilots. While the 30 mm autocannon is standard in all of the ordnance load-outs, when adding a secondary suspended armament, you are limited to only one type. In this case, you will need to choose from 32 light-weight S-5K rockets, two S-24 rockets, two 250 kg bombs or two 500 kg bombs. The added weight and loss of aerodynamics when adding any of this ordnance can be difficult to overcome, especially since this aircraft is built for speed over manoeuvrability. Therefore, these options should be reserved for special situations in the late part of a match, as the attacker/bomber function was never designed as a multi-role function as it was with the [[F-4C Phantom II|F-4C]].

When attacking ground targets, it is best to place the {{PAGENAME}} into a relatively shallow dive, it is important to remember to properly line up for the target ahead of time because with the external ordnance fine-tune manoeuvring can be difficult especially when corrections need to be made at the last minute. Lack of a bombsight makes bombing smaller targets a bit more difficult to hit. When flying low to take on ground targets, make sure you leave yourself an out when the situation turns bad. The best practice here is to ensure you keep your speed up, slow enough to hit the target, but fast enough to get away when the situation turns.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|SRD-5}}-->
The MiG-21F-13 is equipped with a SRD-5 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great top speed and acceleration once spaded
* Has access to 2 x R-3S air-to-air missiles or 2 x S-24 rockets, which can work as air-to-air weapon
* Hard-hitting and accurate 30 mm cannon, quick bursts make 60 rounds last long and are enough for kills
* Although limited, ordnance options are available when needed
* Very good instant turn at all speeds; does not spin easily in a positive G-load stall; stable in simulator
* Can sustain 11G - 12G even at 1,200 km/h IAS (can also pull 13G for a second)

'''Cons:'''

* Sole gun with 60 rounds; difficult for newcomers, a minuscule 3.6 seconds total firing time (compared to 24 seconds of the 3 x gunpods of the F-4 Phantom)
* No countermeasures of any sort; manoeuvring alone must be used to counter AAM
* Quirky rudder characteristics on mouse aim
* AAM missiles are unreliable and slow
* Single type suspended armament, no multi-role options such as missiles + bombs or rockets + bombs
* Flight performance will be limited until flight modifications have been researched

This fighter was the Ye-66a ("Ye" stands for "Yedinitsa" or single-unit), later changed to MiG-21 F-13 or as dubbed by NATO, the Fishbed-C. The F-13 designation identifies as an updated (Forsirovannyy) version which can equip the K-13 missile system capable of using the R-3S air-to-air missiles.

The MiG-21 series of planes would become the most widely-used family of fighter jets in the world, with over 4,000 produced, including license-built copies in China, India and Czechoslovakia. The roots of this highly successful combat aircraft started in the mid-1950s, with the Soviet desire to create a Mach-2 capable light fighter. The first MiG-21F prototypes were presented at the Tushino air show in June 1956, and deliveries started in 1958. The model, "Fishbed C" in NATO parlance, was widely exported. In the Soviet Union, it was replaced by the MiG-21PF model after 1961.

The {{PAGENAME}} was built to be a point defence interceptor not an air-defence fighter slated for combat missions, basically a short-range day fighter. Essentially it was a missile which houses a pilot, one 30 mm cannon and two R-3S air-to-air missiles. The sleek airframe was made with aluminium alloys, steel, magnesium and fibreglass. The air-intake cone automatically adjusts during the flight to help the aircraft remain aerodynamic. The fighter sported a delta wing with a 57° leading edge and even the all-moving tailplane utilizes the swept feature. Everything about this jet focus on speed which lends it reaching out to the Mach 2 range.

===[[wt:en/news/6350-development-mig-21f-13-the-silver-swallow-en|Devblog]]===
Development of the MiG-21 dates back to the early 1950s, when the Mikoyan design bureau was conducting development work on a design study for a new swept-wing jet aircraft. Further work on the project led to the creation of a separate, delta wing prototype, designated "Ye-4". With test flights showing promising results, but also much room for improvement, work on the Ye-4 resumed. Further tweaks and modifications to the design eventually lead to the Ye-5 prototype, which conducted its maiden flight in January 1956.

During testing, the Ye-5 received its new designation "MiG-21" and was officially ordered into production. However, production of this initial batch of MiG-21s was rather short, with only a handful of machines being built. In the meantime, an improved version of the aircraft - the Ye-6 - was being worked on. By May 1958, testing of the Ye-6 was deemed to be completed. Shortly afterwards, in July, the Ye-6 was ordered into mass production under the designation MiG-21F and was to replace the initial MiG-21 as the standard production model. The aircraft weaponry consists of two 30 mm automatic cannons. The next step was to equip the aircraft with guided "air-to-air" missiles but in to do this one of the cannons had to be removed.

From there on, the MiG-21 would go on to be produced in enormous numbers and in various different variants, both for the needs of the Soviet Union, as well as for export. Around 60 countries have or still use the MiG-21 in various capacities and modifications today.

Well over 11,000 MiG-21s have been produced, including licence-built versions (more than 2,400 models were built in China under the J-7 designation), since the start of production in 1959, with the legendary "Fishbed" becoming the most mass produced combat aircraft since the Korean War and taking part in more armed conflicts than a single devblog would ever be able to cover. But as an example we can mention its participation in the Vietnam War where the MiG-21 was able to push back against the latest U.S. aircraft (which were in majority).
