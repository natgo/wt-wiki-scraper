== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the late '60s and early '70s, East Germany would start receiving second and third generation MiG-21 airframes to replace their aging [[MiG-21F-13]] fleet. The primary upgrade among these was the MiG-21MF, standing for ''Modernizirovannyy Forsirovannyy'' (Modernized, Uprated) to denote the overhaul in avionics and the uprated engine of this type. This upgraded model, touting a different radar system over its predecessors, and an updated airframe shape with increased fuel load, and most importantly, armed with the deadly [[R-60]] air-to-air missile, would form the backbone of the East German air force until the arrival of the [[MiG-21bis-SAU (Germany)|MiG-21bis]] and later the [[MiG-23MF (Germany)|MiG-23MF]] aircraft into the East German fleet.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Fishbed-J) was introduced in [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]]. Like the other third-generation MiG-21 airframes, this one features a built in [[GSh-23-2 (23 mm)|GSh-23]] cannon under the fuselage, meaning it does not have to sacrifice the cannon to take countermeasures. In addition to that improvement, the MiG-21MF has a potent arsenal of weaponry for its battle rating, namely the [[R-60]] air-to-air missile. Combined with its incredible high speed manoeuvrability and overall gameplay loop, the MiG-21MF is a very potent fighter aircraft for its tier. Do be wary, however, that while the MiG-21MF is indeed lighter than its Soviet counterpart, the [[MiG-21SMT]], the SMT has a far better engine, which allows it to win dogfights easier assuming both planes start on equal footing.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' has mediocre flight performance in every aspect among top rank jets. It will get out-accelerated by British Phantoms or MiG-21 bis, outturned by Draken or Mirage, and out-sped by 2nd gen US Phantoms (F-4E/EJ), Starfighters or MiG-21 bis. The delta wing provides great angle-of-attack (AoA) while turning but it also mean the plane loses huge amount of speed doing so. This means that staying behind enemy in 1 vs. 1 is fairly simple, but when there are multiple bandits one might lose all their speed and become an easy missile target if turning too much.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The MiG-21MF lacks armour plating. It also has one engine unlike some other planes. This means that the survivability is very low, even among jets. Getting hit is something that should be avoided at all cost, because should the plane survive it, even small wing damage will force the pilot to return to base. The plane has a radar warning receiver (RWR), and countermeasures, including flares and chaff.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Your main priority is to get to the R-60s as soon as possible, this will require you to unlock two tier III modifications. Unless you particularly want to research the ground attack ordnance you will be wanting to unlock "Wings repair" and "New 23 mm cannons" at tier III. Therefore you should research "Offensive 23 mm belts" as your first modification at tier I. This will then unlock tier II modifications where you can research "R-3S" and your choice of "New boosters" or "Airframe" (up to you in which order you unlock these), it may be appealing to unlock missiles first to help with the grind but you should keep in mind that the R-3S missiles are slightly worse than the [[AIM-9B]], which means they cannot be fired in even a gentle turn or climb. Once tier III modifications are accessible, you can unlock "Wings repair" and "New 23 mm cannons" in whichever order you want and then go for the R-60s. Once the R-60s are available you can unlock the remaining modifications in whatever order you see fit, however it is highly recommended to go for G-suit and engine upgrades first.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

While the '''{{Specs|name}}''' itself is a pretty mediocre fighter, it has access to 4 deadly R-60 missiles. These missiles work the best when enemy is slow, so the recommended tactic is to wait a bit before engaging into the battle. If you can manage to get an IRST lock on your target you can guide the R-60 missile off the rail in order to preserve some of the rockets energy.  

Due to the immense speed bleed in turns, it is strongly recommended to keep the speed high near enemies, unless one really wants to closely meet AIM-9J. Dropping below 800 km/h makes it really hard to dodge this missile. When an enemy is spotted, it is recommended to turn roughly into their direction, so when they engage, they'll have to make a 180° turn, which will give time for MiG pilot to disengage without risking getting hit by a missile.

Engaging in 1 v 1 situation can sometimes be done, but unless a faster opponent forces it (which happens rarely, as faster opponents turn worse than the MiG) it is only recommended if there are no other enemies nearby. However, do never turn-fight with Draken or Mirage. A good tactic for defensive dogfights is trying to make enemy overshoot, especially against Phantoms. Keep in mind however that you can outrun F-4C.

===Specific enemies worth noting===

* MiG-21 bis and MiG-21 SMT, if you play against the Soviets. They are faster and have better acceleration (bis in particular) but are slightly heavier and less agile
* Mirage IIIC, has very similar acceleration and top speed, but will outturn MiG-21 MF and has great Matra Magic missiles.
* F-4E/F-4EJ. They are armed with great missiles, fighting them at altitude is not recommended. One the deck they are faster and have better energy retention.
* J35 Draken, will always outturn you. It is very important to keep an energy advantage when attempting to fight the Draken, turn fighting is the worst thing possible against a Draken and tactics that involve retaining energy is best when attempting to fight the Draken. Forcing the Draken to dump its energy is the best way to fight against it.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APS-19}}-->
The MiG-21MF is equipped with a Sapphire-21 search and tracking radar. The radar is mounted in the nose of the aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to four [[R-60]] missiles with great tracking and G-tolerance
* High AoA, very agile and light
* Middling ground attack loadouts
* A small profile which is harder to hit
* Equipped with flares, chaff is available
* One of the many MiG-21 variants capable of using a radar missile, being the [[R-3R]]

'''Cons:'''

* Unsatisfactory cannon armament
* Atrocious energy retention
* No combat flaps
* Excessive fuel burn when using afterburner
* Does not get [[R-13M1]] missiles
* [[R-60]]s chase flares constantly
* Using afterburner on the deck can overspeed the aircraft even in a slight climb

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

The MiG-21MF (Germany) is a second-generation variant of the popular MiG-21 'Fishbed'. Operated by the East German Air Force (''Luftstreitkräfte der Nationalen Volksarmee''; '''LSK''') between 1972 and 1990, the aircraft was an export variant of the MiG-21SM, and is highly similar to its counterpart, the [[MiG-21SMT]]. Designated the 'Fishbed-J', the aircraft formed the bulk of the LSK in the late stages of the Cold War. All German MiG-21 aircraft were retired following the German Reunification, though some survive as museum aircraft to this day.<ref name=":0">Aviata. (2020)</ref><ref name=":1">Museum, D. (2020)</ref>

=== Design and procurement ===
The East German Air Force received many MiG-21 variants due to their ties with the Soviet Bloc. 76 MiG-21F-13 aircraft had been delivered to the East German Air Force in the early 1960s, and they later received 50 MiG-21PF 'Fishbed-D' planes, which were known as the MiG-21PFM in East German service.<ref name=":0" /> This generated considerable confusion as the German MiG-21PFs had inadvertently been given the same name as the later, Soviet-made, MiG-21PFM 'Fishbed-F'.<ref name=":0" /> However, in the early 1970s, the LSK received its first 3rd-generation MiG-21s, the MiG-21MF. This aircraft was essentially an export variant of the Soviet MiG-21SM. 50 MiG-21MFs were delivered to the LSK between 1972 and 1974.<ref name=":0" />

The MiG-21MF differs from the standard MiG-21SM by having a less powerful engine and simplified radar system, meaning that it accelerates slightly slower than its Soviet counterpart. It could reach a maximum speed of 2,230 km/h, and was flown by a single pilot.<ref name=":1" /> As an interceptor, it carried a 23 mm dual-barreled cannon with 200 rounds in a ventral pack, and was also capable of fitting a variety of munitions including bombs, rockets and missiles.<ref name=":0" />

=== Service history ===
The MiG-21MF enjoyed a fairly uneventful service history with the LSK. The aircraft served with ''Jagdgeschwader'' (JG, fighter group) 8 and JG 9. It complemented the earlier MiG-21PFM and MiG-21F-13 aircraft in German service. Later on, it was complemented by the MiG-21bis, the final MiG-21 variant to serve with the German Air Force. At the time of the German reunification, many MiG-21s remained in German service.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> As the new combined ''Luftwaffe'' had no plans to continue using the Soviet-era interceptor, all MiG-21 aircraft were retired in late 1990 following the German reunification. Many of those aircraft were reserved as museum pieces, and several survive to this day in museums across the globe.<ref name=":1" />
