== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Similar to the stories of the "[[F-104G (Germany)|Widowmaker]]" in the West due to its high accident rate, the Eastern Bloc had its own equivalent. The MiG-21 in Hungarian service was one of the most deadly aircraft to its own pilots ever in Hungarian history. Hungary received hundreds of MiG-21s throughout the years, which ended up in 72 total airframe losses and 32 pilot fatalities due to accidents resulting from various problems. Faulty engines in Hungarian MiG-21 batches, improper training, and lack of maintenance on the older models, all resulted in the infamous reputation of the MiG-21 as a widowmaker in the Hungarian Air Force. One of these widowmakers was the MiG-21MF variant, of which Hungary acquired 50 between 1971 and 1974 before being supplemented by the more advanced [[MiG-21bis-SAU (Italy)|MiG-21bis]] just three years later. The MiG-21s saw very long service with Hungary even after the fall of the USSR, with the last MiG-21MFs being retired in 1996.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Fishbed-J) was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]] in the Hungarian sub-tree of the Italian tech tree. Like the other third-generation MiG-21 airframes, this one features a built-in [[GSh-23-2 (23 mm)|GSh-23]] cannon under the fuselage instead of an external Gsh-23L gunpod, meaning it does not have to sacrifice the cannon to take the SPS-141 countermeasures pod. In addition to that improvement, the MiG-21MF has a potent arsenal of weaponry for its battle rating, namely the [[R-60]] air-to-air missile. Combined with its incredible high speed manoeuvrability and overall gameplay loop, the MiG-21MF is a very potent fighter aircraft for its tier. Do be wary, however, that while the MiG-21MF is indeed lighter than its Soviet counterpart, the [[MiG-21SMT]], the SMT has a far better engine, which allows it to win longer dogfights easier assuming both planes start on equal footing. All in all, the MiG-21MF provides acceptable air support and welcomed choice variety to the pilots of the Italian tech tree around this battle rating.
