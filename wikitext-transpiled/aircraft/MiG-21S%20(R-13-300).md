== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Fishbed-J) is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The MiG-21S (R-13-300) can take hits from calibres lower than 30 mm guns in minor parts, but if the engine is damaged it will surely fall. A missile hit will knock out the fighter instantly or cause it to crash.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The MiG-21S (R-13-300) is best used as a supporting plane that can take out fighters already busy with a dogfight. Since it does not have the best missiles, it is best to target players that are not paying attention and/or flying in a straight line. Being a supporting aircraft means you should try avoiding getting into a furball but use your speed advantage to fight enemies that are alone. Therefore, you will most likely meet strike aircraft or base bomber aircraft such as the F-5C, AV-8A, AV-8C, and Harriers. These planes will be the most threat to you. Try to have an altitude advantage as you have superior speed, and then missile the enemies that are slow/in a dogfight. Be reminded that it is not wise to fly low because the lack of countermeasures means you will need to do a lot of evasive manoeuvres to counter missiles.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Fast aircraft, possesses a powerful engine that will get you to the battle much quicker than most
- Multiple loadouts allow decent CAS/AA options for Ground {{Annotation|RB|Realistic Battles}}
- Radar missiles can surprise opponents not expecting to be engaged at such a distance
- Tight turn rate

'''Cons:'''

- Air-to-air missiles are underwhelming and are mostly effective only against inattentive pilots
- Bleeds excessive amounts of energy during turns
- Cannon requires careful use due to the limited amount of rounds
- Energy retention isn't the greatest
- Fuel-hungry engine, 20m of fuel will quickly disappear if not paying attention

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
