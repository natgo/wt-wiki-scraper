== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Fishbed-J) is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Like all MiG-21s, the MiG-21S is a very fast interceptor. With a powerful engine (the same used by the [[MiG-21SMT]]), the MiG-21S has very good acceleration and top speed compared to other supersonic fighters like the [[MiG-19PT|MiG-19]], the [[F-100D|F-100 Super Sabre]] and the [[F-105D]]. Being a delta wing fighter, it's capable of extreme manoeuvres, but it loses speed very quickly and in a few turns it would be stuck at less than 600 km/h.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The MiG-21S (R-13-300) can take hits from calibres lower than 30 mm guns in minor parts, but if the engine is damaged it will surely fall. A missile hit will knock out the fighter instantly or cause it to crash.

{{main|GSh-23L (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 23 mm GSh-23L cannon, belly-mounted (200 rpg)

The GSh-23L is a very powerful weapon, that requires practice to be used properly. It has a low muzzle velocity and a small ammo pool compared to other planes at its BR. But it compensates this with a very good damage output, being capable of destroying almost any aircraft with a small burst.

The MiG-21S can equip several options for both air-to-air combat and ground support.

For air-to-air combat, the R-3S and R-3R missiles are the only options. These missiles share the same properties but the R-3S is a caged IR missile, which means that it needs to point directly to the back of an enemy aircraft in order to get a lock. The R-3R in the other hand is a radar guided missile. Unlike the R-3S, it has a small area in which the aircraft can change direction, making it possible to lead the missile towards the direction in which the enemy is heading. The R-3R is overall a better missile but it's hard to use close to the ground due to the lacklustre radar in the MiG-21, and the R-3S is excellent in picking slow moving enemies at any altitude and moment.

For ground ordnance, the MiG-21S has ballistic computers for both rockets and its cannon. So in ground RB it's possible to use it as a multirole fighter, with 2 rocket pods and 2 missiles for air-to-air combat, providing cover to the team.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MiG-21S (R-13-300) is an excellent fighter when used in high altitudes or support roles, where its powerful engine makes it a very awkward opponent.

'''Arcade Battles:'''

In AB, the MiG-21S will constantly see a multitude of enemies, but the most dangerous ones would be the A-10, the F-5C, and other MiG-21s. In these battles, staying at high altitudes and managing the afterburner use is very important, since missiles like the AIM-9L and R-60M and early radar missiles are a dangerous threat to the MiG-21S due to its lack of countermeasures. Thus, staying fast and high, and using its radar missiles from good positions would make you survive longer and be a more useful teammate.

'''Realistic Battles:'''

In RB, the MiG-21S should also be used in a support role and at high altitudes but it can also be used as a frontline fighter, with more risk. When flying at altitudes above 5,000 m the MiG-21S easily reaches Mach 1.3, and its radar is free of ground clutter. At this altitude, common enemies are the F-104 Starfighter, other MiG-21s, Harriers, and the F-8E Crusader, the Crusader being the most dangerous thanks to the AIM-9C radar-guided missile and countermeasures. At higher altitudes, the missiles can fly longer and faster, while aircraft became more sluggish due to the thinner atmosphere, which is very beneficial for the R-3Rs since they are very early missiles and can't pull very hard. In a support role, attacking slow aircraft, especially those focused in fights or bomb runs, is a good way to help your team. Its good speed also makes the MiG-21S a very good hunter, attacking damaged aircraft that are retreating back to their airfield.

'''Simulator Battles:'''

In SB, the MiG-21S is a more tricky fighter. Because it has a radar with IFF (Identification friend or foe), tt can be used in high altitudes to intercept enemy bombers and other fighters. But its lack of countermeasures would cement its future in that role. Fortunately it has an RWR. Something very useful to know when another plane has a radar lock on you. Aside from that, pilots should be extremely careful, because even with an IFF system, the MiG-21S can lock onto allied aircraft and cause friendly fire incidents. For ground loadouts, the MiG-21S has a very bad frontal cockpit visibility, making CAS duties really hard even with the ballistics computer for bombs and rockets.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast aircraft, possesses a powerful engine that will get you to the battle much quicker than most
* Multiple loadouts allow decent CAS/AA options for Ground {{Annotation|RB|Realistic Battles}}
* Radar missiles can surprise opponents not expecting to be engaged at such a distance
* Tight turn rate

'''Cons:'''

* Air-to-air missiles are underwhelming and are mostly effective only against inattentive pilots
* Bleeds excessive amounts of energy during turns
* Cannon requires careful use due to the limited amount of rounds
* Energy retention isn't the greatest
* Fuel-hungry engine, 20m of fuel will quickly disappear if not paying attention

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The MiG-21S was a variant of the MiG-21 family for more multipurpose design. It fitted more fuel capacity, a cannon pod, four hard points and an RP-22 radar. It was delivered exclusively to the Soviet Air Force. This variant included a more capable powerplant, the R11F2S-300 engine, which gave it significantly more thrust.

The MiG-21S radar, was a production version of the Sapfir-21 and included several more features for increased survivability and multirole capabilities. It included an ASP-PF-21 computing gunsight with ballistics computer. Included an AP-155 autopiloting system, with an auto recovery system for use in emergencies. The airframe was similar but not the same as that of the MiG-21PFM, since it used the same saddle tank as the MiG-21R. It was capable of carrying the GP-9 cannon pod for the GSh-23L 23 mm gun. Its four hardpoints made it capable of carrying drop tanks, for increased fuel capacity at long flights.

In its arsenal, it included the R-3R radar guided missile (K-13R), a semi-active radar-homing missile based in the R-3S (K-13) missile, which was not present in the MiG-21PFM even though it had the same radar as the MiG-21S. This variant of the MiG-21 was produced for 1965 to 1968 and saw no use outside of the Soviet Union.
