== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the early 1970s, the issue of low range in the MiG-21s was brought to attention of the higher ups in the Soviet Union and the Mikoyan design chain. The issue caused by high fuel consumption of the R-13 engine coupled with the small amount of fuel carried on board in this interceptor's small airframe. Two solutions were quickly devised, the first being a upgraded, more efficient engine, which would not be ready for a while. The other solution was to simply hammer in a larger fuel tank into the MiG-21's airframe. The resulting design for the second solution was the MiG-21SMT (''Sapfir Modernizirovannyy Toplivo,'' "Sapphire [Radar], Modernized, Fuel [Increased]"). This variant featured a plethora of upgrades, namely the updated model of the Sapfir radar and its respective fire control system, allowing the aircraft to use not only [[R-3R]] radar guided missiles, but the latest [[R-60]] and [[R-60M]] close range missiles. But the largest difference in this variant was the increased fuel load from the comically large saddle tank added, earning this variant the nickname "Hunchback" among its pilots, who strongly disliked flying it. The SMT also featured a strongly upgraded engine, to cope with the weight increase of the extra fuel and new avionics, but this was sadly not enough to appease the pilots, who found the SMT to be generally unfavourable to fly compared to the older, lighter, and more nimble Fishbeds. The "Hunchback" was so unpopular with Soviet pilots (who regularly complained to their higher ups about the SMT), that all MiG-21SMTs were rebuilt into the MiG-21ST variant starting from 1972, which was essentially just a MiG-21SMT with the smaller (and lighter) saddle tank from the [[MiG-21bis]].

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Fishbed-K) was introduced in [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]]. Being the first Soviet fighter in the game with access to countermeasures, this aircraft opens many new doors to pilots of the Soviet tree. The SMT also brings with it many new weapons to the Soviet fighter line, such as the [[R-3R]] radar missile and the deadly [[R-60]] close range missile. In addition to the under-the-hood upgrades, the SMT also features a very strong engine, allowing for fast acceleration and great top speed, and also features a massive increase in fuel capacity, resulting in a steep weight increase. All of these changes from previous fighters require pilots of the MiG-21SMT to completely re-learn how they fly and engage enemy aircraft, as the SMT will very quickly bleed its speed during almost any manoeuvre, but on the other hand can easily gain it back if it disengages safely and flies straight using the powerful engine. Most importantly, this aircraft acts as a decisive criterion in the play style of the Soviet jets that follow it. Players who enjoy this aircraft for its flight performance and ability to dogfight most of its adversaries up close should move on to research the foldered [[MiG-21bis]], the ultimate Soviet MiG-21 model, while those that favour this aircraft's avionics and missile advantages over its opponents may wish to advance directly to the [[MiG-23M]] Flogger, a radically different design which relies much more on its strong missiles and avionics than its flight performance.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

As an evolution of the previous [[MiG-21F-13]], the {{PAGENAME}} inherits some flight characteristics of its older sibling.

Both of them can pull high angle-of-attack (AoA) which enables its pilot to easily get guns on target at the cost of extreme speed loss. Both of them are light aircraft which enables them to climb with ease. And both of them have high wing loading, which can hinder manoeuvrability, particularly at high altitudes where the atmosphere is thinner. However, that's where the similarities end, as the {{PAGENAME}} comes with upgrades, most notably removed armour which shaved 500 kg off its scale and an uprated engine, the R-13F-300, which outputs 5722 kgf, 700 more than R-11F-300 on MiG-21 F-13. In practice, this means that the {{PAGENAME}} is best in class when it comes to acceleration and climbing performance.

Manoeuvrability-wise, the SMT is extremely nimble at lower altitudes, where its high AoA can outweigh its high wing load, and high acceleration can mitigate speed loss, allowing it to pull hard turns, provided the pilot monitors the speed. At high altitudes, the story is different, as it proves to be very unresponsive, leaving the user vulnerable to attacks, particularly to missiles. One more characteristic any prospecting user should note is that the aircraft tends to break its wings beyond 11 G, and considering the {{PAGENAME}} will merrily pull over 12 G at high speed turns if the boosters modification is equipped, unequipping it may help if the pilot has trouble with wings ripping.

When it comes to raw straight-line speed, the {{PAGENAME}} can get to its top speed much faster than its contemporary fighters at any altitude. In fact, speed should always be monitored, as it can easily reach its relatively high wing speed limit of ~1,300 km/h indicated airspeed (IAS), even at level flight. High acceleration and high top speed mean that the {{PAGENAME}} is more than able to intercept almost any target, the only exception being [[F-4C Phantom II|F-4C]] which is already sitting at its top speed. One more notable feature is that due to its low weight and high thrust, energy management is a breeze and the aircraft will quickly both lose and gain speed, which may prove useful when trying to stay on the target's back.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} is a light fighter and its survivability reflects that. It lacks armour and the airframe is fragile. On top of it all, MiG-21, in general, has a very unstable airframe, which means that any changes to its aerodynamic properties may make it difficult to control. Exercise caution when flying it.

The {{PAGENAME}} can be armed with both anti-air missiles and ground strike ordnance on its four hard-point pylons under the wing. While most of the weapons can be seen on other aircraft, the unique weapon that this aircraft can carry is R-60 IR air-to-air missile. Compared to R-3S which can be found on most Soviet aircraft capable of launching missiles, R-60 has a much more sophisticated IR tracking system, allowing it to track targets up to 5 km away, and keep them on its sights at a much faster pace, which results in a reliable lock that not many targets can shake off. R-60 can also be fired in a wider range of situations, as the missile can track targets while on the pylon. This is critical to how the missile works which means that the missile has a much higher launch load factor and is able to intercept targets immediately after being launched. This is much different than the R-3S which tracks targets only half a second after launch and needs the platform to stay still in order to track the target, leaving the aircraft vulnerable to attacks. R-60 is a much smaller missile than R-3S, weighing at 44 kg instead of 77 kg that an R-3S weighs. Missile's explosive payload is also significantly smaller, weighing at 3.5 kg. Rocket motors on R-60 are much smaller than on R-3S and this means that R-60 is much slower than R-3S, and even though it can lock on targets at 5 km, it has a lower range than R-3S. In practice, R-60 is a reliable and potent anti-aircraft weapon that excels at taking out even nimble targets in dogfights at ranges from 300 m to 2 km but is unable to reach targets beyond 3 km due to its less powerful rocket motors. R-3S, however, can only be used reliably at targets which are not paying attention or are unable to react quickly to a missile launch, but they can also be used to intercept targets at much further ranges than R-60.

When it comes to dumb-fire rockets, {{PAGENAME}} can carry S-5K 55 mm rockets and S-24 240 mm rockets. S-5K have a small warhead that is able to penetrate 150 mm of armour at 0°. However, due to their small warhead, they need a direct hit on the target in order to do any damage and even if they do connect, the damage is minimal to any armoured target. S-24, though, is a 235 kg behemoth, capable of taking out most targets with a single hit.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Combining its ability to pull high angle-of-attack on demand, excellent acceleration, high top speed and powerful dogfighting weaponry, {{PAGENAME}} is a potent air superiority dogfighter/interceptor. It allows the pilot to intercept any target, quickly get on its back and stay there, while also giving the user a safety net in the shape of its acceleration that enables it to break from any engagement with ease. It is recommended to stay at low altitude and not use full elevator if not in a dogfight. For air-to-air combat, the 4 x R-60 setup is the most versatile, albeit the 2 x R-60 and 2 x R-3R setup will allow you to get the most out of head-on scenario. If going for the latter option, make sure to create a keybind to switch between the different missiles using the [[Weapons selector]] mechanic. Overall, the MiG-21SMT is a versatile plane adaptable to any playstyle.

'''Enemies worth noting'''

* [[F-8E]] - A common enemy, while it turns worse, it retains energy significantly better. It is capable of carrying AIM-9C SARH guided AAMs, which can be very dangerous at higher altitude if chaff is not carried.
* [[F-5C]] - One of if not your most common enemy. it retains energy better but struggles regaining speed when at low speed due to poor engine power.
* [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MiG-21MF]] - The MiG-21MF is very similar to the MiG-21SMT, it carries R-60 missiles which are very hard to evade by manoeuvring alone, however it can be fooled by flares very easily.
* [[Mirage IIIE]] - Carries the Matra Magic I AAM that are nearly impossible to dodge without flares. However, when in a dogfight, the Mirage IIIE is inferior in almost every aspect.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|Sapphire-21}}-->
The MiG-21SMT is equipped with a Sapphire-21 search and tracking radar. The radar is mounted in the nose of the aircraft.

The MiG-21 was a supersonic interceptor aircraft designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau (Mikoyan OKB) located in the Soviet Union. The development of the aircraft began in early 1950's, when Mikoyan OKB finished their first design of the aircraft designated as Ye-1. However, the prototype was quickly determined to be too under-powered, and led to the a redesign of the aircraft, designated Ye-2. Both of these aircraft and the prototype to follow had swept back wings, such as those found on the MiG-15. The first prototype to have the signature delta wings of the MiG-21 was the Ye-4. The aircraft made it's maiden flight on June 16th, 1955, and made its first public appearance during the Soviet Aviation Display at Moscow's Tushino Airfield in July 1956. The MiG 21 became the Soviet Unions first successful fighter and interceptor aircraft, it was lightweight, and had a powerful afterburner, allowing it to reach speeds of up to Mach 2, and was comparable to the French Dassault Mirage III, and American Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter and Lockheed F-104 Starfighter at the time. However, the aircraft had a short range, which was worsened by the poor placement of its fuel tanks. Due to this, the development of the MiG-21 SMT began. The SMT variant of the MiG-21 contained more fuel tanks in the spine of the aircraft, which resulted in the aircraft being hard to fly as a result of the enlarged spine. The fuel tank however, did give the aircraft an increased range of up to 250 km (155 mi). The SMT variant also had an electronic countermeasures capability. The MiG-21 SMT is no longer in service.
