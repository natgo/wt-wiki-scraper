== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->By the prime of the 1970s, the East German Airforce started recieving the [[MiG-21bis]] to update their fighter-interceptor fleet from the aging [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MiG-21MF]]<nowiki/>s and PFMs. East Germany would recieve exactly 46 of the type, with 14 of them being the "Fishbed-L" variant, equipped with the Lazur-M GCI (Ground Controlled Intercept) guidance system. The other 32 would be the "Fishbed-N" variant, equipped with the Polyot-OI guidance system instead. To diffrenciate the two variants, the aircraft recieved unique names in East German service, being called the '''[[MiG-21 "Lazur-M" (Germany)|MiG-21bis Lazur-M]]''' and the '''MiG-21bis-SAU''' respectively. The only way to visually tell apart the two aircraft is by a single antenna under the forward fuselag, which is missing on one of the variants due to its different guidance system.

Introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"|Update "Ground Breaking"]] as the latest East German top tier fighter in the German tech tree at the time, the '''{{Specs|name}}''' builds upon the playstyle of the previous [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MiG-21MF]] in the tree, relying alot more on its incredible flight performance to utilize hit-and-run tactics against unsuspecting enemies, and to dogfight its way out of most trouble it finds its way in. The MiG-21bis may have great flight performance and engine power, but lacks in most other departments. Being a delta wing, its energy retention is abysmal, although that problem is slightly mitigated by the very powerful engine, which can quickly regain speed if the aircraft safely disengages and flies in a straight line. The aircraft's avionics and suspended weaponry is where the largest let-down is. While other aircraft at your battle rating will have pulse-doppler radars, powerful missiles, and very informative RWR systems, the MiG-21bis has none of that. Instead, you get what is easily one of the worst dedicated radar sets at this battle rating, subpar missiles, a complete lack of BVR capability, and the weak SPO-10 RWR system. All in all, the MiG-21bis falls under the same loop of the late Fishbed family, relying alot more on the skill of the pilot due to its strong flight performance and weak systems. It is truly a hard plane to learn, but a very rewarding one if mastered correctly.
== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The MiG-21bis-SAU has very nice acceleration, especially at lower speeds, this allows for a quick takeoff roll and quick recovery of energy after a dogfight. It also accelerates the MiG up to and exceeds the airframe limits for top speeds at medium to low altitudes regularly. The MiG-21 has a delta wing, which gives it exceptional agility, nose authority, and raw AOA. Pilots of the MiG-21bis-SAU will find the aircraft capable of "pointing" the nose at the enemy aircraft in most situations, and the raw thrust the MiG has will also allow for a degree of stallfighting. However, as a delta-winged design, it will bleed a lot of speed in high AOA manoeuvres, so prolonged dogfights will not be in the MiG-21bis-SAU's favour against more conventional wing designs.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
[[File:MiG-21bis-SAU armour layout.png|thumb|Armour layout for the MiG-21bis-SAU (Germany)]]

* 60 mm (64°) Bulletproof glass - Central windshield
* 10 mm Steel plate - Behind the pilot's head rest

There is barely any armour in the plane to protect the pilot, fuel tanks, or engine. The little armour it has will not save you from a head-on attack with any enemy unless you are lucky.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

As with other high-ranking jet aircraft, performance, countermeasures, and improved missiles are imperative for the MiG-21bis-SAU. These will allow pilots of the MiG to both survive longer and deal more damage to the enemy team.

The first modification recommended to unlock is Flares/Chaff, at tier 1. Then Compressor for extra acceleration. Afterwards, gaining both the R-3S and R-3R modifications, plus Airframe will lead up to tier 3 modifications. The R-13M missile is recommended as the first modification for tier 3, followed by Wings Repair and Offensive 23 mm. This will allow tier 4 research, and the R-60MK, an all-aspect IR dogfight missile. Fuselage repair, New Boosters, G-suit, Engine, and Cover will finish off performance mods and give MiG-21bis-SAU pilots the best performance possible in the aircraft. Bombs, Rockets, and EFS can come in any order, as the MiG-21bis-SAU is primarily focused on air-to-air combat.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|GSh-23L (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

A choice between two presets:

* 1 x 23 mm GSh-23L cannon, belly-mounted (250 rpg)
* 1 x 23 mm GSh-23L cannon + 64 x countermeasures

The GSh-23L cannon will be familiar to pilots which have already flown the [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MiG-21MF]].

It has relatively low velocity with a high fire-rate, therefore it is recommended for pilots to engage enemies at relatively close range, or enemies that are travelling at a fairly slow speed. Pilots should be mindful that with the ammo capacity of 250 rounds, this gives a trigger time of roughly 4.4 seconds, so trigger discipline will help the aspiring MiG-21bis-SAU pilot. The GSh-23 has high damage output, so even a few rounds will usually cripple or destroy enemy aircraft.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|OFAB-100 (100 kg)|FAB-250M-62 (250 kg)|FAB-500M-62 (500 kg)|ZB-500 incendiary}}
{{main|R-3R|R-3S|R-13M1|R-60MK}}
{{main|S-5K|S-24}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance presets:

* Without load
* 2 x R-13M1 missiles
* 4 x R-3S missiles
* 4 x R-3R missiles
* 4 x R-13M1 missiles
* 4 x R-60MK missiles
* 6 x R-60MK missiles
* 64 x S-5K rockets
* 64 x S-5K rockets
* 4 x S-24 rockets
* 8 x 100 kg OFAB-100 bombs (800 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg FAB-250M-62 bombs (500 kg total)
* 2 x 500 kg FAB-500M-62 bombs (1,000 kg total)
* 2 x ZB-500 incendiary bombs

The MiG-21bis-SAU can be outfitted with a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons. The R-3S and R-3R missiles are very basic missiles, both pulling a maximum of 10Gs and with very limited range. The R-3S is the IR version, while the R-3R is the SARH (Radar) version. The R-3S has very a negligible use case, as the MiG-21Bis-SAU comes with two R-13M stock. It can be used if the pilot simply wishes for two extra missiles however. The R-3R is more useful for pilots that wish to have the capability to engage enemy air targets at a further range headon, though compared to other SARH missiles of the rank, such as the [[R-24R]] or [[AIM-7F Sparrow|AIM-7F]], it lacks the potency to reliably dispatch manoeuvring targets. The next missile carried is the R-13M1, which is the missile carried stock and one of the two recommended for use. It has greater range than the R-60MK, especially at high altitude, though it is a less manoeuvrable missile. The R-60MK is the final missile carried by the MiG-21bis-SAU. It is a highly manoeuvrable, all aspect missile perfect for use in close in dogfights. It lacks the range of contemporary missiles such as the [[AIM-9G Sidewinder|AIM-9G]] or the previously mentioned R-13M1, however it is highly manoeuvrable and will begin quickly pulling off the rail, hitting most targets within around a 2 km area in front of the aircraft. The recommended loadout for most missions will be either 6 of the R-60MK, or two R-13M and 4 R-60MK using the custom loadout feature to give a mix of ranged weapons and more manoeuvrable, dogfight missiles.

Although the primary focus of the MiG-21bis-SAU is for air combat, it is also able to carry a limited selection of anti-ground ordnance. This includes a selection of 100, 250, and 500 kg bombs, along with the ZB-500 Incendiary bombs. As for rockets, it carries the S-5K and S-24 rockets. If pilots wish to use the MiG-21bis-SAU for ground strike, the S-24 rockets are a good choice as the plane also has CCIP for the rockets.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MiG-21bis-SAU will feel similar to the preceding [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MiG-21MF]] to its pilots, with even quicker acceleration and higher top speed. When playing the MiG-21bis-SAU, it is recommended to keep in mind some of the strengths and weaknesses of the aircraft. As a delta-winged design, similar to the [[Mirage III (Family)|Mirage family]] or [[SAAB 35 Draken (Family)|Draken]], the MiG-21bis can pull exceptionally hard, and can effectively "point" the nose wherever its pilot wishes. On the other hand, whilst doing so, a lot of speed is lost and sustained turning will eventually rob the MiG of the energy it had going into a fight. Therefore going into sustained dogfights is not recommended, especially against planes such as the [[F-5 (Family)|F-5]], [[MiG-23 (Family)|MiG-23/27]], or [[F-14A Early|F-14 Tomcat]]. All of these planes will have much better energy retention in a sustained turn than the MiG-21bis-SAU, and in a sustained turn will eventually simply have a decisive energy advantage over the MiG. Therefore it is recommended to use the MiG-21s ability to pull inside of enemy aircraft to attempt to fire on the enemy aircraft.  If unable to do so, the MiG-21bis should attempt to use the excellent acceleration to reset the fight and try again.

When on the defensive many of the same rules apply. it is recommended to run either flares or mixed countermeasures depending on playstyle. Chaff will help decoy radar-homing missiles such as the [[AIM-7 Sparrow (Family)|AIM-7]] or [[AIM-54A Phoenix|AIM-54]], but if pilots prefers flying low, terrain can serve that purpose instead and the extra flares can definitely be useful with standard countermeasures. As previously stated, delta wings bleed a lot of energy while turning. This can be very useful when defending against enemies with better energy retention, as a good MiG-21bis-SAU pilot can use the speed bled by manoeuvres to cause the enemy aircraft to overshoot, and then attempt to use the gun or missiles to take out the enemy. This is the preferred way to go defensive in the MiG-21bis-SAU, as oftentimes most of the enemy aircraft have better energy retention and are usually relatively easy to force an overshoot against.

The one area the MiG-21bis-SAU has an issue with is in BVR (beyond-visual-range) combat. The only radar missile the plane receives is the R-3R, which pales in comparison to the [[R-24R]] or [[AIM-7 Sparrow (Family)|AIM-7]] that are now very common in high rank air matches. Attempting to challenge planes such as the MiG-23MLD or F-14A at long range and high altitude is not recommended, the MiG-21bis-SAU excels in close range combat and every attempt by pilots should be made to close the range to enemies, and then using the arsenal of shorter ranged, but still highly potent weapons to finish off enemy aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Stunning acceleration
* Very good climb rate
* Good high speed manoeuvrability and can make turns at a high angle of attack
* Can wield 6 x R-60MKs
* GSh-23L cannon has 250 rounds (50 more than the MiG-21MF)
* Access to countermeasures and airbrakes

'''Cons:'''

* Bleeds speed very quickly
* Bad low speed manoeuvrability
* Rudder lock above 700 km/h can be frustrating when trying to get guns on target
* Doesn't respond well to wing damage
* Can overspeed easily at sea level due to tremendous acceleration and has a low top speed compared to any contemporaries 
* Low muzzle velocity for the GSh-23L cannon.
* Despite having all-aspect missiles, the armament still extremely limited to short range and both R-60MK and R-13M1 have zero flare resistance
* Primitive radar and almost useless even in spotting targets
