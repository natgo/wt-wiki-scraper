== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO: Flogger-F) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

MiG-23BN was based on its previous model MiG-23B which a dedicated attacker, where MiG-23B was based on the airframe of 1st generation MiG-23S interceptor. While it looks exactly like previous MiG-23s in-game, all the bombs, AGMs, and rocket pods will certainly tell another story to the targets on the ground while excelling at fast speed to leave the combat area. Alternatively, it can take down aircraft with its gunpods and a similar mobility to the MiG-23 interceptor variants.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
At first glance, aside from having the LSK's emblem (East German Air Force), the MiG-23BN looks exactly like any other Flogger. A closer inspection on its nose gives its identity away: as an attacker, MiG revised the nose with a flat bottom for the B variants; but the BN removed the optical equipment for this exact job. Since it was based on the first-generation MiG-23 but with a R-29B-300 engine, the overall flight performance is very similar to the [[MiG-23M]] in the Soviet tech tree but without AAMs. Experienced players might take the use of its iconic variable swept wing for dogfights, but do keep in mind that a major problem of these 1st generation Floggers were exactly the wings, it might be sufficient to take down heavier jets like Phantoms if utilized the wings well, but having only guns for air-to-air operations makes it a huge target for other jets. Any extra ordnance ranging from bombs up to AGMs affects the flight model severely, so utilize its speed in missions and avoid dogfights unless in dire situation.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The MiG-23BN has only a pair of 16 mm steel plates on the side of the cockpit as extra protection against other targets. If it has to commit to a head-on fight or even a dogfight, it might not have sufficient survivability to leave the combat in one piece.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
For players who jumped from the subsonic [[G.91 R/3 (Germany)|G.91 R/3]] into the MiG-23BN, not only it is supersonic and goes up to mach 2.0, it also carries as much ordnance as its TT predecessor [[IL-28 (Germany)|IL-28]]. For players of MiG-27 or MiG-23 variants, the flight performance is very similar as they were built under similar airframe but with some revision differences per blocks (batches). Some players might want to take it for a dogfight for its manoeuvrability as well as the variable swept-wing; but as an attacker, it doesn't have any AAM at disposal, the only viable option is the 23 mm gun for gunning down enemy jets with its fast rate of fire and sufficient damage. Additional 23 mm cannons can be mounted as wing-mount gunpods. The MiG-23BN doesn't have countermeasures either, the airframe is also rather unprotected other than 2 steel plates on the sides of the cockpit, so avoid enemies at all cost and only fight enemies when there's only one of them- any more than this number means the MiG-23BN will become an easy prey for the enemies due to its enormous size.

But there are some good news for the jet though: it is a very fast attacker in-game (only slower than its [[Su-22UM3K (Germany)|Sukhoi counterpart]]) and the payload is sufficient to deal devastating damage to enemies. It might not be as much as USAF's [[F-4C Phantom II|F-4C]] or British's [[Buccaneer S.2|Buccaneer]], but the varietiy of bombs or AGMs will fit the player's playstyle one way or another. For players who demand a fireworks show on the ground and create as many craters as possible, conventional and incendiary bombs are at your disposal. While for a safer approach or for those who are not used with manual-guided missiles like the [[AGM-12B Bullpup|AGM-12B]] or the [[AS-20 Nord|AS-20]], it does comes with a pair of Kh-23M AGMs using mouse control with devastating damage. If the enemy SPAAGs, interceptors or in some occasion, helicopters with AAMs (namely, [[TY-90|TY-90s]] found on PLAGF helicopters) are in business, the excellent speed of the MiG-23BN will certainly help you to get away from trouble since there are few jets that can catch up with your mach 2.0 top speed (but in high-altitude). Speed is what makes MiG-23BN unique among jet attackers of its era and BR; any prolonged fight in the combat area hugely increase its risk of meeting its end.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Great top speed
* Great acceleration
* Great energy retention
* Sufficient payload for ground-attack
* Variable swept-wing makes it manoeuvrable
* Equipped with RWR

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks flares
* Lacks AAMs
* Relatively small ammo pool for the fixed 23 mm cannon
* Rather large size makes it easier to hit
* RWR only shows radar pings and locks from 4 sides
* Due to swept wing design it is hard to aim at high speeds
* The plane can only reach up to mach 1 below 5000 meters
* At high altitudes the engine's performance drops significantly
