== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Following adoption of the MiG-23B ground-attack variant of the [[MiG-23 (Family)|MiG-23]], Mikoyan OKB quickly set out to modernize and upgrade the aircraft where possible. The first of these many upgrades was the MiG-23BN variant, with the main difference being the usage of the Type 3 wings of the MiG-23ML and an upgraded variant of the R-29 engine. The BN variant saw almost no use with the Soviets, instead being a very popular export model to both Warsaw Pact and Third World customers. During the mid-late '70s, the East German airforce received 18 MiG-23BNs, especially modified by removal of the dielectric fairings, and received without any countermeasure dispensers. These aircraft would serve in the forefront of the ground attack roles alongside the [[Su-22M4 (Germany)|Su-22]] aircraft used by the East German air force.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO: Flogger-H) is a dedicated ground attack variant of the MiG-23, introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]] to the German tech tree. It lacks any form of countermeasures, guided ordnance, or air-to-air missiles, but do not let this deter you, as in air battles, the aircraft is not only very versatile and fast (having the flight performance of the MiG-23s at a far lower battle rating), but with the ability to take gunpods and outrun almost every enemy it faces, it is a force to be reckoned with when used in the fighter role at its battle rating. The aircraft also shines in mixed battles, where it can use its ballistic computer to accurately rain bombs and small-calibre rockets over a wide area, or precisely pick enemy tanks off using the powerful [[S-24B]] rockets, accurately aimed using the CCIP computer. All in all, the MiG-23BN is an aircraft that appears bad on paper at first and turns away many players, but those who truly master its playstyle in both air and ground battles are heftily rewarded with a very fearsome aircraft.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
At first glance, aside from having the LSK's emblem (East German Air Force), the MiG-23BN looks exactly like any other Flogger. A closer inspection on its nose gives its identity away: as an attacker, MiG revised the nose with a flat bottom for the B variants; but the BN removed the optical equipment for this exact job. Since it was based on the first-generation MiG-23 but with a R-29B-300 engine, the overall flight performance is very similar to the [[MiG-23M]] in the Soviet tech tree but without AAMs. Experienced players might take the use of its iconic variable swept wing for dogfights, but do keep in mind that a major problem of these 1st generation Floggers were exactly the wings, it might be sufficient to take down heavier jets like Phantoms if utilized the wings well, but having only guns for air-to-air operations makes it a huge target for other jets. Any extra ordnance ranging from bombs up to AGMs affects the flight model severely, so utilize its speed in missions and avoid dogfights unless in dire situation.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The MiG-23BN has only a pair of 16 mm steel plates on the side of the cockpit as extra protection against other targets. If it has to commit to a head-on fight or even a dogfight, it might not have sufficient survivability to leave the combat in one piece.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
For players who jumped from the subsonic [[G.91 R/3 (Germany)|G.91 R/3]] into the MiG-23BN, not only it is supersonic and goes up to mach 2.0, it also carries as much ordnance as its TT predecessor [[IL-28 (Germany)|IL-28]]. For players of MiG-27 or MiG-23 variants, the flight performance is very similar as they were built under similar airframe but with some revision differences per blocks (batches). Some players might want to take it for a dogfight for its manoeuvrability as well as the variable swept-wing; but as an attacker, it doesn't have any AAM at disposal, the only viable option is the 23 mm gun for gunning down enemy jets with its fast rate of fire and sufficient damage. Additional 23 mm cannons can be mounted as wing-mount gunpods. The MiG-23BN doesn't have countermeasures either, the airframe is also rather unprotected other than 2 steel plates on the sides of the cockpit, so avoid enemies at all cost and only fight enemies when there's only one of them- any more than this number means the MiG-23BN will become an easy prey for the enemies due to its enormous size.

=== High-altitude bombing ===

For the reasons mentioned above, dogfights should be completely avoided in Air RB and Combined Battles. Instead, in a contested airspace such as Air RB, the MiG-23BN excels as a high-altitude bomber. The two loadouts recommended for this are either 6 x 500 kg bombs (roughly 1.5 bases' worth) or 16 x 100 kg and 2 x 500 kg bombs (1.33 bases' worth, but gives higher rewards). With the latter, the optimal drop order is either 2 drops first for a third of a base, then the rest for a full hp one, or 12 "drops" first (which coincides with a preset bomb series) for a whole base, and the rest for a third of one.

After takeoff, maintaining a 10-15° climb allows the jet to reach a 9,000 m altitude before encountering the enemy. Pilots should watch for condensation trails from the enemy's direction, as that means that an enemy fighter is also climbing to a high altitude. If no support is available, avoid the area until the hostile engages someone else. After reaching 9-10,000 m, fully extending the wings allows the plane to maintain the altitude without afterburner when in a 3-5° climb. Disengaging the afterburner greatly reduces the range enemy missiles can achieve a lock-on. It is recommended to wait until the bases have respawned at least once, as the bombs can take more than 40 seconds to hit the target, and are easily wasted if a teammate takes out the base.

Once the teammates are returning to base, the CCRP target selector can be used to align the plane with a base, then, holding the bomb series key (with the series set to 4 or 12) and maintaining level flight, allows the bombs to accurately hit the target (With Weapon Maintenance maxed out, the bombs should have near 100% accuracy). Alternatively, a dive can be used to align the bomb indicator and drop manually.

It is not recommended to return to base in a dive, as the plane can destroy itself due to its excessive speed. Keeping the altitude change positive completely avoids this and allows for a greater speed to be maintained.

=== Combined battles ===

Relative to its BR, it is a very fast attacker in-game (only slower than its [[Su-22UM3K (Germany)|Sukhoi counterpart]]) and the payload is sufficient to deal devastating damage to enemies. It might not be as much as USAF's [[F-4C Phantom II|F-4C]] or British's [[Buccaneer S.2|Buccaneer]], but the variety of bombs or AGMs will fit the player's playstyle one way or another. For players who demand a fireworks show on the ground and create as many craters as possible, conventional and incendiary bombs are at your disposal. The Kh-23M missiles are arguably the least useful weapon in its loadout. With a ballistic computer, its unguided rockets are actually significantly easier to use than the MCLOS missile and are much more forgiving thanks to the large number it can carry. One unconventional and highly situational use for the AGMs is to launch them at enemy fighters with maximum horizontal guidance. The smoke trail and the movement gives the appearance of a radar-guided missile and can deter inexperienced players. Attempting to actually hit a jet fighter with a manually-guided missile yields very little results.

If the enemy SPAAGs, interceptors or in some occasion, helicopters with AAMs (namely, [[TY-90|TY-90s]] found on PLAGF helicopters) are in business, the excellent speed of the MiG-23BN will certainly help you to get away from trouble since there are few jets that can catch up with your mach 2.0 top speed (but in high-altitude). Speed is what makes MiG-23BN unique among jet attackers of its era and BR; any prolonged fight in the combat area hugely increase its risk of meeting its end.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Great top speed
* Great acceleration
* Great energy retention
* Sufficient payload for ground-attack
* Variable swept-wing makes it manoeuvrable
* Equipped with RWR

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks flares
* Lacks AAMs
* Bombs won't drop above Mach 1
* Relatively small ammo pool for the fixed 23 mm cannon
* Rather large size makes it easier to hit
* RWR only shows radar pings and locks from 4 sides
* Due to swept wing design it is hard to aim at high speeds
* The plane can only reach up to Mach 1 below 5,000 m
* At high altitudes the engine's performance drops significantly
* Gunsight lacks information to effectively use CCRP in simulator battles
