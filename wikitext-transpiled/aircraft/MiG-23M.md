== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Red Skies"]].

The MiG-23M is the first version of the MiG-23 to see wide operational service. It is a very different plane from the preceding [[MiG-21bis]], with variable sweep wings, side air intakes, sophisticated avionics, and access to R-23 missiles with good range. The MiG-23M is the first Soviet fighter with a real BVR capability and pilots can enjoy using R-23R missiles for long range radar-guided jousting or R-23T missiles for IRST-cued sneak attacks. It is no slouch in close quarter engagements either, where lower wing sweep settings give it great sustained turning capability and its all-aspect R-60M missiles can do good work. As to be expected however for an early variant of such a revolutionary aircraft, it is a bit rough around the edges: the thrust-to-weight ratio is worse than the MiG-21bis, it is not great at short-term turning, and it has a limited supply of only 12 large-caliber countermeasures. Still, it brings a lot of new features to the table, and Soviet pilots who master it will be very pleased with the succeeding [[MiG-23MLD]].

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Two different tactics are recommended when flying the MiG-23M:

- Low altitude, high speed, side of the map. Try to get as much speed as possible maintaining a very low altitude and go to the right if you want a more head-on engagement or to the left if you want a side/back of the enemy attack position (in a majority of maps players go to their left). Better used with a squadron, the MiG-23M can eliminate several enemy aircraft if played right with 3 teammates and using the all-aspect IR-guided R-23T missile.
- High altitude, high speed, together with your team, BVR. Fly along with your team, maintain a high altitude until all enemy aircraft are below you, then make surprise attacks on enemies that are busy, normally use the R-23R to destroy the high altitude F-4s or F-104s with BVR missiles.

No matter which tactic though, it is recommended to engage your enemy from their front hemisphere, since you can carry all-aspect IR missiles. This way it leaves your enemy less time to react and dodge the missiles.

Also, since both the R-60Ms and the R-23Ts have a relatively wide FOV, it is recommended to lock the enemy using your IRST before engaging the missile lock to slave the missile, and better utilise their wide FOV.

Only use the R-60Ms at close range, around 1.5 km. They perform best under such range, and it also gives your enemy less reaction time to release the countermeasures, since R-60Ms are easily tricked by flares.

When in a 1v1 situation, try to use your great low-speed performance to trick the enemy into low speeds, especially when against Phantoms. When your speed drops below 400 km/h, manually control the wing to the most frontal position to improve your manoeuvrability.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very high low-altitude top speed, could outrun any of your opponents.
- Decent sustained turn rate.
- Reasonably high acceleration for its size.
- R-23T and R-60M all-aspect missiles.
- Variable swept-wing aircraft, allowing for decent performance at any speed.
- HUD displays speed and altitude information, most useful in simulator mode.
- Can carry 6 x R-60M AAMs.
- Contains IRST tracking system and decent radar that allows you to track aerial targets at ground level.
- Varied armament preset selection.

'''Cons:'''

- Underwhelming instantaneous turn rate, cannot pull some extreme windows easily.
- Loses quite a lot of speed in turns.
- Low countermeasures count.
- Low ammo count and low muzzle velocity for the GSh-23L cannon.
- R-60Ms are easily distracted by flares.
- R-23T/R-23R air-to-air missiles struggle in close combat.
- Radar is not on par with NATO counterparts.
