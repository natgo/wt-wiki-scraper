== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Winged Lions"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7469-event-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2021 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R.]] event.

The MiG-23MF is an export modification of the Soviet [[MiG-23M]]. In this modification, the avionics were changed in favour of more budgetary and somewhat simplified systems. The MiG-23MF was delivered to all the main countries of the Warsaw Pact, as well as to the Arab states of the Middle East, Africa, India and Cuba.

The MIG-23MF inherits all the main characteristics from the original - good top speed, a very good climb rate, a variable sweep wing and a large array of weaponry. The disadvantages also remained: a limited number of countermeasures, a limited number of weapon suspension nodes and rather mediocre manoeuvrability at transonic speeds.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Air battles'''

Low altitude, high speed, side of the map. Try to get as much speed as possible maintaining a very low altitude and go to the right if you want a more head-on engagement or to the left if you want a side/back of the enemy attack position (in a majority of maps players go to their left). Better used with a squadron, the MiG-23MF can eliminate several enemy aircraft if played right with 3 teammates and using the all-aspect IR-guided R-23T missile.

High altitude, high speed, together with your team, BVR. Fly along with your team, maintain a high altitude until all enemy aircraft are below you, then make surprise attacks on enemies that are busy, normally use the R-23R to destroy the high-altitude F-4s or F-104s with BVR missiles.

No matter which tactic you choose, it is recommended to engage your enemy from their front hemisphere, since you can carry all-aspect IR missiles. This way it leaves your enemy less time to react and dodge the missiles. Also, since both the R-60Ms and the R-23Ts have a relatively wide FOV, it is recommended to lock the enemy using your IRST before engaging the missile lock to slave the missile, and better utilise their wide FOV. Only use the R-60Ms at close range, around 1.5 km. They perform best under such range, and it also gives your enemy less reaction time to release the countermeasures, since R-60Ms are easily tricked by flares.

When in a 1-vs-1 situation, try to use your great low-speed performance to trick the enemy into low speeds, especially when against Phantoms. When your speed drops below 400 km/h, manually control the wing to the most frontal position to improve your manoeuvrability.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Relatively high cruising and top speeds
- Extremely good climb rate
- Manoeuvres better than most of its opponents (such as the Phantoms and other MiG-23s/27s)
- Excellent air-to-air payload, having a wide array of missiles for almost all situations
- Decent air-to-ground payload available
- Large calibre countermeasures are very effective, one to two salvos will be required to evade any missile
- Stock payload includes 2 [[R-13M1]] AAMs
- Can use its radar ballistic computer to hit targets with the cannon beyond the aim assist range (770 m)
- CCIP for rockets allows to deliver quick and very accurate rocket bursts at designated targets, especially in mixed battles

'''Cons:'''

- Underwhelming instantaneous turn rate, cannot pull some extreme manoeuvres easily
- Somewhat prone to stalling, especially after getting hit in one of the wings
- Loses quite a lot of speed in turns
- Bleeds a large amount of energy with its wings swept
- Relatively low countermeasures count (12)
- Low ammunition count and low muzzle velocity for the GSh-23L cannon
- Negative-G manoeuvres at high speeds could cause a wing rip, even for a few seconds
