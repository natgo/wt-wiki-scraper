== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Shortly after the introduction of the [[MiG-23M]] into Soviet service, a "watered down" variant was conceived for export to foreign customers. The resulting design, the MiG-23MF, came in two flavours, designated Izdelyie 23-11A and 23-11B. The primary difference was that the 23-11A was essentially a MiG-23M with the nuclear delivery systems removed, for export to Warsaw Pact countries, while the 23-11B was even more watered down with a downgraded radar, IFF, autopilot, and GCI controller, specifically for export to third-world and Middle Eastern countries. Hungary received 12 MiG-23MFs, which served until 1997 when they were retired in favour of NATO-compatible aircraft to replace them (soon to be the Gripen).

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]], is a Hungarian fighter-interceptor in the Hungarian sub-tree of the Italian tech tree.  Being a "toned down" export variant of the initial variants of the Flogger, this plane is pretty much identical to the [[MiG-23M]] found in the Soviet tech tree, or the [[MiG-23MF (Germany)|MiG-23MF]] event vehicle in the German tree. Being a copy of the MiG-23M means that it retains all advantages and disadvantages of its Soviet brother. The MiG-23MF retains its strong weapons systems and incredible dogfight characteristics thanks to the variable geometry wings, and also retains its abysmal survivability thanks to the comically small amount of countermeasures and outdated RWR system. All in all, this aircraft creates a great learning step between the [[MiG-21bis-SAU (Italy)|MiG-21bis-SAU]] and the [[MiG-29 (Italy)|MiG-29]] in the tech tree. All in all, it provides a great alternative to the MiG-21Bis-SAU in the same branch of the tech tree as the MiG-23MF relies less on its flight performance and more on its missiles and avionics.
