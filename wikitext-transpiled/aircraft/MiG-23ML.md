== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The first generation [[MiG-23M]] (and its export variant, the [[MiG-23MF (Germany)|MF]]) had a lot of shortcomings as was expected from a completely new and unique aircraft design. Over time, the most severe issues were addressed, and a complete rework of the MiG-23 airframe was conducted in the early 1970s. The airframe was completely redesigned in a way that trimmed down the drag and weight, by removing the No.4 fuel tank in the fuselage, cropping the dorsal fin extension, and redesigning the landing gear and wing-sweep mechanisms to be not only lighter, but more robust and reliable, the MiG-23ML (with L standing for "Lyogiky", i.e "Lightweight"). These upgrades were then mated with two other major changes to the MiG-23 airframe. The first being the new Tumansky R-25F-300 engine, increasing the thrust of the aircraft noticably. The other difference, was a complete overhaul of the flight and fire control systems to modern standards, chief of which was the new Sapphire-23ML radar and TP-23M IRST, the latter of which was rated at up to twice the range of its predecessor. The new systems allowed the aircraft to greatly increase its defensive and offensive capabilities, through the ability to use BDS-50-60 countermeasure dispensers and the new R-24 missile, in addition to a few upgrades to the CAS ordnance of the aircraft, namely the ability to use the UPK-23 gunpods.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a pack premium introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]]. It is functionally identical to the [[MiG-23MLA (Germany)|MiG-23MLA]] found in the German tree, and is slightly different from the [[MiG-23MLD]]. Just like those two aircraft, the MiG-23ML is a very capable and versatile plane, with a powerful engine and a diverse arsenal of weaponry to choose from. The RP-23ML radar is strong for its battle rating, which coupled with the [[R-24R]] and [[R-24T]] missiles, provides a very lethal combination for engaging enemy aircraft at BVR.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The MiG-23ML has superior flight performance with its powerful engine and variable-geometry wing design which allows for faster turning on demand. With over 10,000 kgf of thrust, its thrust-to-weight ratio rivals that of even the F-104S. While the plane lacks the leading-edge slats of the MiG-23MLD, this gives it an energy retention advantage in sustained dogfights.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The MiG-23ML has no armour protection. It is a somewhat large plane, so it can survive low caliber bullets as well as a few higher caliber ones if lucky. The plane is equipped with 72 large-caliber countermeasures; with optimal flaring tactics, one can survive several missiles launched at them. As you have only one engine, your performance will be severely impaired if it is damaged. You will be out of the fight if the engine is destroyed. Fuel tanks are located on the wings, in the centre of the plane, and above the engine. All fuel tanks are self-sealing. While the engine is equipped with a fire suppression system, using it will disable the engine. Only use it if you have enough speed and distance to return to your airfield.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
As a premium vehicle, the MiG-23ML comes with all modifications unlocked. All premium vehicles are equipped with a talisman, which doubles RP and SL rewards.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MiG-23ML is very versatile and has usefulness in nearly every combat situation. In air battles, the MiG-23ML can carry six short-range air-to-air missiles, or four of them with two medium-range air-to-air missiles. The best air-to-air missiles for the plane are the R-60 and R-24. While the R-13 and R-23 can be useful, they are inferior to their counterparts in every way. One interesting trait of the MiG-23ML is that the IRST used with the R-23T or R-24T can wipe out unsuspecting enemies, especially towards the beginning of the match. The R-60s, while excellent at turning, have a shorter range than similar short-range missiles. The plane has very good energy retention and has some of the best flight performance out of any plane at its BR.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Excellent variety of armaments to choose from
* Excellent flight performance and versatility
* Adequate dogfighting ability with variable-geometry wings
* A useful radar and an IRST mode
* Large-calibre countermeasures

'''Cons:'''

* Limited internal cannon ammunition (~3.5 seconds of firing time before depletion)
* Large engine limits survivability from successful hits
