== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This aircraft has a versatile set of play styles any pilot can use for any situation, a good set of examples would be ones seen below focusing on two sides of the spectrum of engagements.

* High Speed SARH Slinger: The idea of this playstyle is to climb to between 5,000 and 7,000 m altitude and travel around Mach 1.4 to 1.8 in a straight line finding alone enemies who look like good targets and to send an R-24R at them biting fast and retreating fast like a snake, allowing you to score a relativity easy hit, and if it misses or you are noticed, an escape is easy to pull off thanks to your already high speed and higher altitude allowing you to retreat to the airfield to restock. Though be careful for any other aircraft at that altitude that could shoot you down, this is why speed is key to survival.
* Close Quarters All Aspect: The idea of this playstyle is to hang low to the ground in-between hills and tree lines while travelling around Mach 1, this allows you to be ready to ambush and turn fight any aircraft that gets close, and with the ability to carry the all-aspect R-24T you can send one to an enemy between 4 km to 6 km away from cover at most angles to get a surprise hit, or if they evade it to try to turn into you, you can easily use your mobility to out-turn them and A) gun them down, or B) fire an R-60MK at them.

Those are just two examples of play styles that works for this aircraft on different sides of the spectrum, BVR engagements and close range engagements. You do not need to however use these exclusively, but use the knowledge learned to see where this aircraft can perform best at in given situations, and test varying levels play styles to find one that fits you well. This aircraft is great at surprising enemies with its mobility and speed, so playing around those strengths well help a lot in making the most of the aircraft. This can also be applied through out AB, RB and SB, but it is recommended to test and adjust elements of the desired playstyle to fit the game mode of your choosing.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Wide selection of air-to-air weapons such as short range IR R-13M1/R-60MK and long range R-24T/R-24R
* Excellent manoeuvrability
* Outstanding speed (reaching Mach 1.2 - 1.6 is easy to achieve and can provide a large advantage, reaching Mach 1.9 to 2.2 on EC maps is even easier)

'''Cons:'''

* Carries a limited number to air-to-air weapons
* Radar is limited to 30 km range vs. its NATO counterparts (this is however fixed by flying above 2,000 m to enter "look-down" (LD) mode, there is also a 60 and 90 km option)
* Very few options for air-to-ground loadouts
