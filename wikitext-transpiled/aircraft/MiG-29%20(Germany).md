== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great top speed at all altitudes; with a wing rip speed of Mach 1.3 at sea level 
* High turning performance and agility, especially at low to medium speed
* The GSh-30-1 cannon is well suited for air combat, possessing effective damage and ballistics
* Highly effective radar system, has TWS along with PD and Head-Down modes
* Possesses the R-27ER1 SARH missile, with strong speed, acceleration, and tracking
* Has a potent IRST for slaving IR missiles
* Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) allows for fine pointing of Radar and IRST

'''Cons:'''

* High fuel consumption on afterburner; as little as 4 minutes without a drop tank
* The twin engines burn hot, producing a large signature for enemy IR missiles
* R-60MK IR missiles have a rather short range 
* Can easily G-LOC due to high manoeuvrability
* Relatively narrow radar search width of 30°, inferior to the 120°+ found on F-14s and F-16s

== History ==
