== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the 1980s, the East German Air Force acquired 24 examples of the Soviet MiG-29 fighter. The specific model they acquired was the 9.12 chassis variant, lacking the upgraded fuel capacity of the [[MiG-29|9.13]] model, among other technological downgrades for export usage. These MiG-29s would be the most advanced aircraft ever operated by the East German air force, as only a few years later, Germany would be re-unified. All 24 of the East German MiG-29s would be passed on to the Luftwaffe, who used them in service for over a decade after that due to their incredible performance, a rare move as a majority of the East German Soviet-built aircraft passed on to the Luftwaffe after reunification were either sold or retired almost instantly. This would prove to be vital in NATO aircraft and weapon development, as up until that point, the MiG-29 was heavily underestimated by the Western air forces. This would all change in 1994, when a dissimilar air combat training between USAF [[F-16A]]s of the 510th Fighter Squadron and Luftwaffe MiG-29s took place in a NATO airbase in Aviano, Italy. After an overwhelming victory from the German MiG-29s, utilizing the [[R-73]] and their helmet-cued targeting, the USA and the rest of the NATO countries realized that they had underestimated the MiG-29's superb performance, and quickly kickstarted development of equivalent weapon systems (AIM-9X, ASRAAM, IRIS-T) and aircraft upgrade variants ([[F-16C]], Rafale-C, etc.) to match the MiG-29. The German MiG-29s would serve well with the Luftwaffe for over a decade with only a single aircraft lost to accidents, before being sold off in 2003 in one of the most famous arms deals in recent history, where 22 of the German MiG-29s were sold to Poland for the comical price of 1€ each (22€ total for the fleet, $26.02 USD at the time of the deal). The final remaining German MiG-29 was touched-up and restored to be displayed at the ''Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr'' in Berlin, becoming the only surviving German MiG-29 in a German livery today.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a 4th generation fighter for the German tech tree, introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]]. The MiG-29 9-12A (NATO reporting name: Fulcrum-A) is a specialized export variant of the MiG-29 9.12 for Warsaw Pact countries. Building upon dogfighting doctrine established with the earlier [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MiG-21MF]] and [[MiG-21bis-SAU (Germany)|MiG-21bis-SAU]] in the tech tree, and the advanced weapon employment techniques learned with the [[MiG-23MLA (Germany)|MiG-23MLA]] that precedes it, the MiG-29 not only builds upon the playstyles of its predecessors, but adds on to it with many new tools and weapons, such as the powerful [[R-27ER1]] missile and a HMD (Helmet Mounted Display) targeting system for its all-aspect IR missiles. In general, the MiG-29 in the German tech tree brings a formidable aircraft to that rank for Germany players, and ends up being an overall great introduction to the 4th generation fighter era for players of the German aircraft tech tree.

The MiG-29 has a unique flight character, its engines consume a lot of fuel thus the external fuel tank, getting rid of the external fuel tank will reduce drag and improve the performance of the aircraft, this is mostly done before engaging a target. But the engines also provide excellent thrust at a very wide range of speeds giving you enough power to engage in long-lasting dogfights. The aircraft is not equipped with variable wing sweep, which is not very noticeable. Only when flying at high speeds at lower altitudes will you begin to notice that the wings produce much lift. The MiG-29 has decent manoeuvrability at high and low speeds, the energy retention is not something to complain about either. The 30 mm guns have a high velocity, making it easy to aim at targets, and are much better than earlier Soviet aircraft. The missiles which are the most effective are the R-60MK and R-27ER1. The R-60MK are very easy to flare off, and at its BR many people will dodge these missiles in a head-on fairly easily. But the R-27ER1 has some very effective performance, with an improved radar system this missile will rock the battlefield.

'''Air combat'''

At the start of a match, take all the fuel you can and make sure your custom loadout has drop tank equipped in it. Equip air target belts, 4 R-60MK's and 2 R-27ER1/R1 or 2 R-27T1 (depending on what you prefer). Take off and start going into a flank position, your goal here is to pick off alone flying jets. The MiG-29 excels at solo fighting and performs the best when engaging single targets. Make sure to stick near the ground until you have found yourself a target. Once you got yourself a target, start engaging it and keep your speed up. If the target is high altitude or long distance, make use of your R-27 missiles to take care of it from a distance. But when players decided to hunt down enemy jets with SARH missiles, the enemies will do the same and here comes a flaw to the electronics of the jet: the SPO-15 RWR; although claimed to be all-aspect, the system is in fact divided into 8 smaller sectors at the front-aspect while having only 2 sectors at the rear-aspect, this can be a major problem when multiple targets have a lock on MiG-29 - the pilots have to make a guess on where exactly the source comes from, especially when enemy jets is chasing MiG-29. This can be a major problem in SB battles with only cockpit view. When in close range make use of your R-60MK, but beware of enemy targets that might join the fight. It should be noted to stay away from flock of enemies, the MiG-29 performs poor when under pressure from multiple targets and will become a easy elimination to the enemy. The suggested radar modes for basic users to use are: SRC PD and HMD PD (for close range). During close range dog fighting the MiG-29 can make use of both the radar and IRST to get a lead indicator when locked on target, which is extremely useful and makes eliminating by gun easier. Lastly: keep a eye on your fuel, because this Jet consumes it so fast that in important dog fights you might run out of fuel mid-battle.

'''Guide on R-27R1/ER1'''

To use the radar variants of the R-27 to the fullest make sure to firstly enable "Use rectangular radar indicator", disable "Target cycles switching of aircraft radar" in the settings and set up keybinds for "Horizontal Radar/IRST target cue control axis" and "Vertical Radar/IRST target cue control axis". By doing all of this you have now full control over your radar which will allow you to maximize your potential. Once taken off, make sure to either have TWS or TWS HDN as selected radar mode, this will allow you to see in third person where the selected (not radar locked) target is and where it is heading. Change the scope scale to 100 km to be able to see where the flock of enemies is going, and with that information adjust your trajectory into a flank. Your goal here is to pick off individual high-flying targets, so with use of your horizontal and vertical cue control go over incoming radar pings and sort out which target is most likely to remain at high altitude. Start flanking the target and getting closer to it. When at a range of 15-20 km, lock on to the target and fire away your radar-guided missile. The enemy will not have enough time to break the radar lock and will get destroyed by the fast incoming R-27R1/ER1. If the targets are getting below 10 km range, prepare yourself to swap into HMD PD (within visual range combat radar mode). This will allow you to make use of the helmet-mounted display to lock on to any target you look at. This will allow you to lock on to jets who are not near the ground, and once the missile is fired away the target will have little chance evading it. When fired below 3 km, the enemies might be able to evade/dodge the missile due to the sheer launch speed it has.

'''CAS'''

The MiG-29 can be used as a fast interceptor of enemy targets in Ground Realistic. Equip your MiG-29 with 6 x FAB-500SH, add 2 R-60MKs optionally. Start heading to the battle area and go for a behind approach of the enemy spawn, this will allow you to take care of SPAAs or any other targets with a surprise. Once you found yourself a target, prepare to slow down to near Mach 1 and align your CCIP with the target, drop all or half of all the retarded bombs with a 0 second fuse (the bombs slowly fall on the target, allowing you to escape the blast while also instantly eliminating the target). Once the bombs have been dropped, either start speeding off back to the airfield for more bombs, or make use of your R-60MKs to take care of any enemy air targets. Furthermore, make sure to swap your radar into IRST mode, as you do not carry any radar missiles and it will make you more stealthy to face off enemy jets. It is suggested to also take a mixed countermeasures loadout, it can help you dodge surface-to-air missiles and break their lock on.

'''Enemies worth noting'''

[[F-16 (Family)|F-16 series]] : The F-16's are considered the top opponent against the MiG-29, having a equal amount of power and ability to combat you. Singularly you might have an upper hand in skill and abilities thanks to the R-27 and R-60 missiles, but beware. The moment a F-16 teams up with one another, they become a formidable and dangerous group. The more F-16's are flying as a flock the more dangerous they become. In comparison with the MiG-29: the F-16 performs better in groups, and it is that what you have to look out for. It's best to avoid engaging into a flock of F-16's, but to rather engage it from a distance (with use of R-27 missiles) or wait for the flock to fall apart. This will give you again a upper hand over the F-16 and give you the ability to combat it 1-on-1. Further than that make sure to keep an eye out for their missiles, they have an excellent medium range and can retain a IR lock very well. In addition, at high speed the F-16 is much less manoeuvrable than the MiG-29. When in a 1-on-1 with an F-16 it is advisable to keep your speed up - the more speed you and your opponent lose, the more manoeuvrable the F-16 becomes. Do not try to engage in a turning engagement with a slow F-16, as it is likely they will out turn you with its superior low-speed turn rate.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great top speed at all altitudes; with a wing rip speed of Mach 1.3 at sea level
* High turning performance and agility, especially at low to medium speed
* The GSh-30-1 cannon is well suited for air combat, possessing effective damage and ballistics
* Highly effective radar system, has TWS along with PD and Head-Down modes
* Possesses the R-27ER1 SARH missile, with strong speed, acceleration, and tracking
* Has a potent IRST for slaving IR missiles
* Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) allows for fine pointing of Radar and IRST

'''Cons:'''

* High fuel consumption on afterburner; as little as 4 minutes without a drop tank
* The twin engines burn hot, producing a large signature for enemy IR missiles
* R-60MK IR missiles have a rather short range
* Can easily G-LOC due to high manoeuvrability
* Relatively narrow radar search width of 30°, inferior to the 120°+ found on F-14s and F-16s
* The SPO-15 RWR is pseudo-all-aspect where the detections are divided into different sectors instead of showing the exact direction
