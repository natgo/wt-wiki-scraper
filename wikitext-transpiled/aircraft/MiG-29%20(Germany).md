== Usage in battles ==
The MiG-29 has a unique flight character, its engines consume a lot of fuel thus the external fuel tank, getting rid of the external fuel tank will reduce drag and improve the performance of the aircraft, this is mostly done before engaging a target. But the engines also provide excellent thrust at a very wide range of speeds giving you enough power to engage in long-lasting dogfights. The aircraft is not equipped with variable wing sweep, which is not very noticeable. Only when flying at high speeds at lower altitudes will you begin to notice that the wings produce much lift. The MiG-29 has decent manoeuvrability at high and low speeds, the energy retention is not something to complain about either. The 30 mm guns have a high velocity, making it easy to aim at targets, and are much better than earlier Soviet aircraft. The missiles which are the most effective are the R-60MK and R-27ER1. The R-60MK are very easy to flare off, and at its BR many people will dodge these missiles in a head-on fairly easily. But the R-27ER1 has some very effective performance, with an improved radar system this missile will rock the battlefield.

'''Air combat'''

At the start of a match, take all the fuel you can and make sure your custom loadout has drop tank equipped in it. Equip air target belts, 4 R-60MK's and 2 R-27ER1/R1 or 2 R-27T1 (depending on what you prefer). Take off and start going into a flank position, your goal here is to pick off alone flying jets. The MiG-29 excels at solo fighting and performs the best when engaging single targets. Make sure to stick near the ground until you have found yourself a target. Once you got yourself a target, start engaging it and keep your speed up. If the target is high altitude or long distance, make use of your R-27 missiles to take care of it from a distance. when in close range make use of your R-60MK, but beware of enemy targets that might join the fight. It should be noted to stay away from flock of enemies, the MiG-29 performs poor when under pressure from multiple targets and will become a easy elimination to the enemy. The suggested radar modes for basic users to use are: SRC PD and HMD PD (for close range). During close range dog fighting the MiG-29 can make use of both the radar and IRST to get a lead indicator when locked on target, which is extremely useful and makes eliminating by gun easier. Lastly: keep a eye on your fuel, because this Jet consumes it so fast that in important dog fights you might run out of fuel mid-battle.

'''Guide on R-27R1/ER1'''

To use the radar variants of the R-27 to the fullest make sure to firstly enable "Use rectangular radar indicator", disable "Target cycles switching of aircraft radar" in the settings and set up keybinds for "Horizontal Radar/IRST target cue control axis" and "Vertical Radar/IRST target cue control axis". By doing all of this you have now full control over your radar which will allow you to maximize your potential. Once taken off, make sure to either have TWS or TWS HDN as selected radar mode, this will allow you to see in third person where the selected (not radar locked) target is and where it is heading. Change the scope scale to 100 km to be able to see where the flock of enemies is going, and with that information adjust your trajectory into a flank. Your goal here is to pick off individual high-flying targets, so with use of your horizontal and vertical cue control go over incoming radar pings and sort out which target is most likely to remain at high altitude. Start flanking the target and getting closer to it. When at a range of 15-20 km, lock on to the target and fire away your radar-guided missile. The enemy will not have enough time to break the radar lock and will get destroyed by the fast incoming R-27R1/ER1. If the targets are getting below 10 km range, prepare yourself to swap into HMD PD (within visual range combat radar mode). This will allow you to make use of the helmet-mounted display to lock on to any target you look at. This will allow you to lock on to jets who are not near the ground, and once the missile is fired away the target will have little chance evading it. When fired below 3 km, the enemies might be able to evade/dodge the missile due to the sheer launch speed it has.

'''CAS'''

The MiG-29 can be used as a fast interceptor of enemy targets in Ground Realistic. Equip your MiG-29 with 6 x FAB-500M-54 or FAB-500M-62 (the -54 version is lighter with almost the same explosive mass), add 2 R-60MKs optionally. Start heading to the battle area and go for a behind approach of the enemy spawn, this will allow you to take care of SPAAs or any other targets with a surprise. Once you found yourself a target, prepare to slow down to near Mach 1 and align your CCIP with the target, drop all or half of all the bombs on a 0.5 second fuse. Once bombs have been dropped, either start speeding off back to the airfield for more bombs, or make use of your R-60MKs to take care of any enemy air targets. Furthermore, make sure to swap your radar into IRST mode, as you do not carry any radar missiles and it will make you more stealthy to face off enemy jets. It is suggested to also take a mixed countermeasures loadout, it can help you dodge surface-to-air missiles and break their lock on.

'''Enemies worth noting'''

[[F-16 (Family)|F-16 series]] : The F-16's are considered the top opponent against the MiG-29, having a equal amount of power and ability to combat you. Singularly you might have a upper hand in skill and abilities thanks to the R-27 and R-60 missiles, but beware. The moment a F-16 teams up with one another, they become a formidable and dangerous group. The more F-16's are flying as a flock the more dangerous they become. In comparison with the MiG-29: the F-16 performs better in groups, and it is that what you have to look out for. It's best to avoid engaging into a flock of F-16's, but to rather engage it from a distance (with use of R-27 missiles) or wait for the flock to fall apart. This will give you again a upper hand over the F-16 and give you the ability to combat it 1 on 1. Further than that make sure to keep a eye out for their missiles, they have a excellent medium range and can retain a IR lock very well.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great top speed at all altitudes; with a wing rip speed of Mach 1.3 at sea level 
* High turning performance and agility, especially at low to medium speed
* The GSh-30-1 cannon is well suited for air combat, possessing effective damage and ballistics
* Highly effective radar system, has TWS along with PD and Head-Down modes
* Possesses the R-27ER1 SARH missile, with strong speed, acceleration, and tracking
* Has a potent IRST for slaving IR missiles
* Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) allows for fine pointing of Radar and IRST

'''Cons:'''

* High fuel consumption on afterburner; as little as 4 minutes without a drop tank
* The twin engines burn hot, producing a large signature for enemy IR missiles
* R-60MK IR missiles have a rather short range 
* Can easily G-LOC due to high manoeuvrability
* Relatively narrow radar search width of 30°, inferior to the 120°+ found on F-14s and F-16s
