== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Fulcrum-C; Izdeliye [Product] 9.13) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

The first revision of the famous ''Strizhi'' (Swifts; nickname in Russian) family jet fighters, the MiG-29 offers a completely new style of combat, especially when the overall flight performance is vastly superior to the preceding MiG-23s with its light airframe and powerful jet engines, as well as new BVR missiles at its disposal.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Aside from the airframe and the alloy skin themselves, the MiG-29 offers no extra protection to pilots or vital components; although the size is not the biggest among jets of its tier. Hits from cannon or missiles will very likely damage the jet beyond repair or taking down the pilot straight away. In case of a fire onboard, the Engine Fire System can save the jet and leave some thrust for a retreat or revenge kill.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MiG-29 has a unique flight character, its engines consume a lot of fuel thus the external fuel tank, getting rid of the external fuel tank will reduce drag and improve the performance of the aircraft, this is mostly done before engaging a target. But the engines also provide excellent thrust at a very wide range of speeds giving you enough power to engage in long-lasting dogfights. The aircraft is not equipped with variable wing sweep, which is not very noticeable. Only when flying at high speeds at lower altitudes will you begin to notice that the wings produce much lift. The MiG-29 has decent manoeuvrability at high and low speeds, the energy retention is not something to complain about either. The 30 mm guns have a high velocity, making it easy to aim at targets, and are much better than earlier Soviet aircraft. The missiles which are the most effective are the R-60M and R-27ER. The R-60M are very easy to flare off, and at its BR many people will dodge these missiles in a head-on fairly easily. But the R-27ER has some very effective performance, with an improved radar system this missile will rock the battlefield.

'''Air combat'''

At the start of a match, take all the fuel you can and make sure your custom loadout has drop tank equipped in it. Equip air target belts, 4 R-60M's and 2 R-27ER/R or 2 R-27T (depending on what you prefer). Take off and start going into a flank position, your goal here is to pick off alone flying jets. The MiG-29 excels at solo fighting and performs the best when engaging single targets. Make sure to stick near the ground until you have found yourself a target. Once you got yourself a target, start engaging it and keep your speed up. If the target is high altitude or long distance, make use of your R-27 missiles to take care of it from a distance. But when players decided to hunt down enemy jets with SARH missiles, the enemies will do the same and here comes a flaw to the electronics of the jet: the SPO-15 RWR; although claimed to be all-aspect, the system is in fact divided into 8 smaller sectors at the front-aspect while having only 2 sectors at the rear-aspect, this can be a major problem when multiple targets have a lock on MiG-29 - the pilots have to make a guess on where exactly the source comes from, especially when enemy jets is chasing MiG-29. This can be a major problem in SB battles with only cockpit view. When in close range make use of your R-60M, but beware of enemy targets that might join the fight. It should be noted to stay away from flock of enemies, the MiG-29 performs poor when under pressure from multiple targets and will become a easy elimination to the enemy. The suggested radar modes for basic users to use are: SRC PD and HMD PD (for close range). During close range dog fighting the MiG-29 can make use of both the radar and IRST to get a lead indicator when locked on target, which is extremely useful and makes eliminating by gun easier. Lastly: keep a eye on your fuel,  because this Jet consumes it so fast that in important dog fights you might run out of fuel mid-battle.

'''Guide on R-27R/ER'''

To use the radar variants of the R-27 to the fullest make sure to firstly enable "Use rectangular radar indicator", disable "Target cycles switching of aircraft radar" in the settings and set up keybinds for "Horizontal Radar/IRST target cue control axis" and "Vertical Radar/IRST target cue control axis". By doing all of this you have now full control over your radar which will allow you to maximize your potential. Once taken off, make sure to either have TWS or TWS HDN as selected radar mode, this will allow you to see in third person where the selected (not radar locked) target is and where it is heading. Change the scope scale to 100 km to be able to see where the flock of enemies is going, and with that information adjust your trajectory into a flank. Your goal here is to pick off individual high-flying targets, so with use of your horizontal and vertical cue control go over incoming radar pings and sort out which target is most likely to remain at high altitude. Start flanking the target and getting closer to it. When at a range of 15-20 km, lock on to the target and fire away your radar-guided missile. The enemy will not have enough time to break the radar lock and will get destroyed by the fast incoming R-27R/ER. If the targets are getting below 10 km range, prepare yourself to swap into HMD PD (within visual range combat radar mode). This will allow you to make use of the helmet-mounted display to lock on to any target you look at. This will allow you to lock on to jets who are not near the ground, and once the missile is fired away the target will have little chance evading it. When fired below 3 km, the enemies might be able to evade/dodge the missile due to the sheer launch speed it has.

'''CAS'''

The MiG-29 can be used as a fast interceptor of enemy targets in Ground Realistic. Equip your MiG-29 with 6 x FAB-500SH, add 2 R-60Ms optionally. Start heading to the battle area and go for a behind approach of the enemy spawn, this will allow you to take care of SPAAs or any other targets with a surprise. Once you found yourself a target, prepare to slow down to near Mach 1 and align your CCIP with the target, drop all or half of all the retarded bombs with a 0 second fuse (the bombs slowly fall on the target, allowing you to escape the blast while also instantly eliminating the target). Once the bombs have been dropped, either start speeding off back to the airfield for more bombs, or make use of your R-60Ms to take care of any enemy air targets. Furthermore, make sure to swap your radar into IRST mode, as you do not carry any radar missiles and it will make you more stealthy to face off enemy jets. It is suggested to also take a mixed countermeasures loadout, it can help you dodge surface-to-air missiles and break their lock on.

'''Enemies worth noting'''

[[F-16 (Family)|F-16 series]] : The F-16's are considered the top opponent against the MiG-29, having a equal amount of power and ability to combat you. Singularly you might have a upper hand in skill and abilities thanks to the R-27 and R-60 missiles, but beware. The moment a F-16 teams up with one another, they become a formidable and dangerous group. The more F-16's are flying as a flock the more dangerous they become. In comparison with the MiG-29: the F-16 performs better in groups, and it is that what you have to look out for. It's best to avoid engaging into a flock of F-16's, but to rather engage it from a distance (with use of R-27 missiles) or wait for the flock to fall apart. This will give you again a upper hand over the F-16 and give you the ability to combat it 1 on 1. Further than that make sure to keep a eye out for their missiles, they have a excellent medium range and can retain a IR lock very well.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High top speed, with enough engine power to reach that top speed even when near sea level
* Good manoeuvrability at low to medium speed
* Effective gun with suitable ammunition load and lethal effect on air targets
* Good radar system able to use Pulse-Doppler and Track-While-Scan to search for targets
* Good radar-guided missiles, particularly the R-27ER
* Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD) sights allows more flexibility with both radar and IRST to target enemy planes off the MiG-29's nose
* Has IRST to search and track enemies, as well as slave IR weaponry, without alerting their Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)

'''Cons:'''

* Manoeuvrability drops at higher speed due to pilot pulling more G's, which can make it difficult to turn quickly without G-LOCing the pilot, such as evading a radar missile fired at close range
* The SPO-15 RWR is pseudo-all-aspect where the detections are divided into different sectors instead of showing the exact direction
* Underperforming IR missiles
* Radar mechanics may have larger margin of error against very long-range (greater than 30 km) and very low altitude planes, even if enemy are within radar missile's weapon envelope
* Very limited supply of ammo (150 rounds)

As proxy wars between the Soviet Union and the USA went on in different battlefields where the latest jets of the era could have been shot down by first generation jets like the MiG-17 (J-5) or the MiG-19 (J-6) in Vietnam, the USAF started their development on the new F-X program to ensure the air superiority in future combats (resulting in the F-15 Eagle). To counter the possible superiority of the new jet, the Soviet Union also started their ''Perspektivnyy Frontovoy Istrebitel'' (lit. "Advanced Frontline Fighter"), a program for an equivalent to the F-X in 1969. But after some development between Soviet firms TsAGI and Sukhoi, since the need for another lightweight jet to counter USAF's Lightweight Fighter program and its resulting product [[F-16A|F-16]] Fighting Falcon in 1971 arose, VVS also called for an ''Perspektivnyy Lyogkiy Frontovoy Istrebitel (lit. "Advanced Lightweight Frontline Fighter")'' where the new jets would become the cornerstones at a 1:2 ratio. After the intensive developments in 1970s, Sukhoi came up with the famous Su-27 Flanker while Mikoyan came with the other famous jet in Warsaw Pact service: the MiG-29 Fulcrum.

Compared to its Sukhoi rival, the MiG-29 traded the advanced flight control system and range of Flankers (until the introduction of the MiG-29S and MiG-29SMT with additional fuel tanks) with its infamous agility over NATO jets. When they were first publicly shown in different occasions through the 1980s, they had already become the new export fighter of choice for Warsaw Pact countries and allied customers over most continents of this planet such as Peru, Libya, Eritrea, India etc. Most of the MiG-29s didn't join conflicts during the Cold War aside from Iraqi ones, where they had to fight Iranian jet fighters, then later the coalition of NATO forces. These jets were then seen in many conflicts up to this date, sometimes even facing other Soviet jets, including the MiG-29's "higher-end" rival: the Su-27 (Eritrea vs. Ethiopia).
