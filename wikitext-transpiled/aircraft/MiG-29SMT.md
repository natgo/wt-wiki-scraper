== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
By the turn of the millennium, the Russian VVS had fallen behind its adversaries again in terms of air power, due to the financial issues of post-Soviet Russia. With lack of funding resulting in the failure of the Mikoyan MFI and the MiG 1.44 program to produce a 5th generation frontline fighter to replace the MiG-29, a new aircraft was required to act as a counter to the latest [[F-16 (Family)|F-16]] variants and new Eurocanard fighters such as the Typhoon, Rafale, and Gripen. RSK MiG decided to restart development of their MiG-29SMT (9.17) from the mid-90s, and presented the idea of a MiG-29 modernized for the 21st century to the Russian government. With the cost savings of updating a older airframe being the main advantage, the development of the MiG-29SMT was greenlit, and the MiG-29SMT was heavily updated and upgraded into the 9.18 and 9.19 variants. To recoup some of the development costs, both variants were almost exclusively intended for export, with a special and slightly downgraded variant of the 9.19 created exclusively for the Russian VVS to save costs. The development of the 9.19 was finalized in 2006 with pre-production aircraft performing regular test flights and air-show demonstrations to lure foreign buyers. In the following years, the MiG-29SMT (9.19) would enter mass production where it would find homes with the Russian VVS, the Algerian Air Force, and the Syrian Arab Air Force.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], brings a new taste to a formidable beast that most top-rank pilots in War Thunder are familiar with. While the flight performance feels significantly worse than its predecessor, the previous [[MiG-29|MiG-29 (9.13)]], the new MiG-29SMT brings to the table a completely game-changing set of weaponry, including some of the best air-to-air missiles in the game such as the R-73 and R-27E family. This, combined with the upgraded avionics, radar, and upgraded assortment of guided ground ordnance for precision CAS, makes the MiG-29SMT a very dangerous and formidable aircraft in the top ranks of War Thunder.

'''Air Combat'''

While the MiG-29SMT has reduced manoeuvrability from the added fuel tank compared to the MiG-29, it's still extremely strong in air combat.

When it comes to BVR, the MiG-29SMT dominates with the R-27ER missiles that have long range and acceptable overload, and its powerful radar that has a lot of special features and acceptable range. This, along with the new SPO-150 RWR that increases situational awareness by giving information about the exact vehicle that's pinging the MiG-29SMT, makes it perfect for BVR combat.

The MiG-29SMT is also strong in close-range engagements. It carries the R-73, which is an extremely effective heat-seeking missile with 40G overload and great range for its type. You'll want to use it in unpredictable ways where the enemy won't expect it to track reliably to avoid being flared away by using the missile's wide gimbal limits.

'''CAS (Close Air Support)/Ground Attack'''

The MiG-29SMT has amazing ground ordnance that allows it to take down ground targets reliably. The TV guided KAB-500Kr-E bombs are incredibly useful, enough to take down several tanks with ease when multiple bombs are dropped. And if you mix the TV guided bombs with the new and improved Kh-29TD air-to-ground missiles, it becomes the perfect aircraft to attack ground targets while remaining viable as a fighter.

You can also select traditional dumb bombs and rockets that, if used with precision, can be lethal to anything that crosses their path.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Incredibly versatile weapon systems; some of the best air-to-air missiles in-game
* Very effective radar, IRST, and HMD targeting systems
* Unlike its predecessor, it has an improved digital RWR that increases awareness.
* Great upgrade in CAS capabilities over its predecessors
* "Rita" voice warning system

'''Cons:'''

* Increased weight over previous variants; heavily downgraded manoeuvrability and acceleration
* Bleeds energy dangerously fast during manoeuvres
* Less countermeasures than majority of its adversaries

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

After the dissolution of the USSR, the Russian Federation sought to find a replacement for its aging older Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters, to match the 4+ and 5th generation capability of its NATO adversaries. The original program for a frontline fighter replacement for the MiG-29, the Mikoyan 1.44, failed due to lack of funding in post-Soviet Russia. Eventually, the Russian Federation would settle for heavily upgrading their existing MiG-29s into 4+ generation standards as a stop-gap solution not only for them, but also for export customers. The resulting project built upon Mikoyan's older ''Project 9.17A'', the original MiG-29SMT from 1996, upgrading it with 21st century avionics and equipment.
[[File:Mig-29smt.jpg|left|thumb|MiG-29SMT "02 Red" at Odintsovo, Russian Federation, circa 2009. This is the same aircraft that the default skin ingame is based on.]]
The "new" MiG-29SMT was split into two models, airframe numbers 9.18 and 9.19, and was developed throughout the early 2000s not only as Russia's new frontline fighter to replace the older MiG-29s, but also as a proper 4+ generation upgrade for export customers still using the older MiG-29A and MiG-29S, and as such was redesigned from the ground up. The new MiG-29SMT would incorporate a plethora of upgrades to differentiate it from all previous MiG-29s, and easily placing it on the same level of technological advancement as some other 4+ generation fighters. The MiG-29SMT, first and foremost, revamped the airframe and how it is controlled. The SMT received reinforced wings and fuel tanks to increase its range, and to account for the weight increase and changes in control, the aircraft features a hybrid control system of both mechanically linked hydraulics and fly-by-wire. The powerplant also included the option for uprated, higher thrust engines for export customers, as the Russian VVS opted out of this engine upgrade to keep unit costs down. One of the primary upgrades for the SMT was extending the poor range of previous MiG-29 variants. This was achieved by not only making the saddle fuel tank noticeably larger (giving the SMT its "hunchback" appearance), but by also adding a in-flight refueling probe on the portside of the nose, allowing for mid-air refueling. The 9.18 variant lacked the larger saddle tank to keep costs down and was marketed primarily for export to smaller countries where longer range was not a important factor. Yemen would be the only customer to purchase the 9.18.
[[File:Mig-29smt 2.jpg|thumb|MiG-29SMT "77 Green" demonstration at MAKS 2015]]
The MiG-29SMT also featured a full overhaul to its avionics suite, with the most important changes being the new Zhuk-M (N-010ME) radar, a modernized and heavily upgraded variant of the older N010 Zhuk originally intended for the [[Yak-141]], specific variants of the Su-27, and the MiG-29M modernization program. The new radar and fire control system were also linked to a new, state-of-the-art "Glass-cockpit" design, where instrumentation was either digitalized, or kept at a minimum for the sake of incorporating Color Multi-function Displays in the cockpit, to streamline the pilot's workload. The new radar and fire control system also allowed the new MiG-29SMT to carry a upgraded arsenal of weaponry, namely the R-74 and R-77 missiles, while also expanding upon the aircraft's CAS capabilities with new ground ordnance such as the [[Kh-29TD]], Kh-31, and [[KAB-500Kr-E (500 kg)|KAB-500Kr]]. The MiG-29SMT's fire control system also included software giving it compatibility with laser ordnance if a laser targeting pod was equipped, and compatibility with some NATO ordnance and targeting systems, intended for export customers' use with mixed hardware.

The MiG-29SMT (9.19) would first take to the skies in 2006, with deliveries to the Russian VVS starting in the following years. The 9.19 would also be exported to multiple countries throughout the 2010s, primarily Algeria and Syria, where it would see decent success in active combat with the latter country in the ongoing civil war. The same could not be said about Algeria, who had opted for the aforementioned option of having upgraded engines, but ended up returning some of the aircraft due to the engines being defective, and acquiring Su-30 aircraft instead to replace the defective MiG-29SMTs.
