== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}'''was the very first jet aircraft to arrive in China and the first jet for PLAAF by 1950. To quickly upgrade PLAAF for the upcoming Korean War and the dire need for major cities' air-defence operations from Nationalist bombers, VVS transferred 9 divisions of the MiG-9 series to PLAAF which also made the officials decide to purchase extra MiG-9 to arm the air force. The aircraft was deemed sufficient to handle earlier jets such as the F-84B or F-80 series, soon after the introduction of the state-of-the-art F-86 series in USAF service and the eventual introduction of MiG-15 in PLAAF service, these MiG-9s were soon retired from frontline and served as PLAAF's jet "lead-in trainer" before their ultimate decommission in 1959.

Introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]] with the initial Chinese aviation tech tree, the aircraft shares identical performance to its Soviet counterpart; while it is small and nimble, as well as packs a very heavy punch against rivals, players have to get used to the WWII-era equivalent engine and the ballistic performance to make good use of the first proper jet fighter of PLAAF; any careless moves or not keeping sufficient speed can lead to an embarrassing demise to the aircraft to even a propeller aircraft.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
When looking at this fighter, a pilot may complain at the lack of ordnance options available, being only limited to a single 37 mm and two 23 mm cannons with what seems to be only a handful of ammunition rounds between them. Without the addition of suspended ordnance, the flight model will not change due to added weight of bombs, missiles, rockets or gun pods, since none are available and the aircraft wasn't designed to use them.

As such, this fighter was built almost like a rocket, needing to get to bomber altitude as fast as possible and intercept inbound bombers. The limited ammunition prevents the pilot from just 'spraying-and-praying', but instead requires trigger control to maximize rounds on target. This is especially important in realistic and simulator battles where after the ammunition is expended, the pilot must return to base to reload.

The MiG-9 has enough speed to get to 5,000 m within about 4 minutes, however once there, it is best to either target bombers and go higher if needed (13,500 m is maximum altitude for the fighter) or to then turn the MiG-9 into a diving fighter and going for quick hits before zooming back up. Immelmanns and Split-S manoeuvres are recommended to change directions as this fighter is a very slow turner, taking about 30 seconds to make a complete circle. It is important to keep the speed up on this fighter due to when it becomes slow, it then becomes an easy target for enemy aircraft.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 12 mm steel - in front of the 37 mm & 23 mm magazines
* 12 mm steel - in front of the pilot, between the instrument panel and the 37 mm & 23 mm magazines
* 55 mm bulletproof glass - windscreen

The MiG-9, unfortunately, is not built like a tank and as a bomber interceptor, it had to be constructed like one, sacrificing armour for speed. The aircraft does feature 55 mm of bulletproof glass on the canopy windscreen and two 12 mm steel plates on both sides of the 37 mm ammunition magazine, but that is it for aircraft protection. All the protection is in the front which is meant to offer defence from any defensive gunners on enemy bombers. From the front profile, the armour plates and glass do a good job of shielding the critical components, however, from just about any other angle, the pilot, engines and fuel tanks are clustered in the centre of the aircraft and are all vulnerable from machine gun, cannon, missile and rocket damage.

{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|N-37D (37 mm)|NS-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 37 mm N-37D cannon, nose-mounted (40 rpg)
* 2 x 23 mm NS-23 cannons, chin-mounted (80 rpg = 160 total)

To fulfil the role of a bomber hunter, the best weapons for mid to late 1940s aircraft was rockets and cannons. Bombers were typically large aircraft and machine guns would not do the job. Bomber interceptors needed to get to the target and spend the least amount of time on target not only for their own safety but to be able to intercept multiple targets before needing to return to base to refuel or rearm. The N-37D and NS-23 cannons centrally mounted on the MiG-9 virtually nullify the need for messing with convergence, allowing the pilot to sling both ammunition types at bombers at 690 m/s. In a high speed pass only so many rounds could be fired off before the MiG was zooming past and needed to set up for another run if they missed.

Having the 37 mm and 23 mm cannons helped ensure if the critical areas are hit, only one pass is needed. Without rockets or missiles to provide backup or alternative weapon options, proficiency with the cannons is a must. The "Air targets" ammunition belt provides a large amount of HE ammunition, which will critically damage enemies, even without a precise hit.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The MiG-9 requires altitude to be most effective in either of its two main roles. While flying full throttle into the middle of the map may seem like the noblest thing to do, it may end your piloting career faster than you care for, not allowing you to reach your full potential during the match. Best bet for this fighter is to start side climbing on the map or working on gaining altitude away from where the main group of aircraft are flying as this provides you with a relatively safe area to climb and allows you to see any enemy aircraft which may be gunning for you and give you enough time to respond or dive away. It is important to begin your side climb at an angle of about 8-10° until the fighter reaches speeds of about 400-500 km/h when the climb angle can be increased to about 15°.

When you reach an altitude of where the bombers are at, you can then begin to patrol and set up for any attack runs. Typically it is best to have some altitude over the bombers as this will allow you to gain more speed when driving and make it that much more difficult for the defensive gunners to hit you. Flying towards the rear of the bomber is the worst angle to come at, while it makes it easy for you to line up the target, you will actually be flying into bullets fired at you causing them a chance for deeper penetration into your jet than if you came from another angle. Due to the limited amount of ammunition, controlled bursts are best especially when aimed at engines, cockpits or fuel tanks. Carefully aim at these critical components and let the ammunition do the rest for you. It is best not to linger around a target, instead, add full power and zoom away until you are at least a kilometre or two away and outside of the range of any defensive turrets before manoeuvring for another run.

If there are no bombers to attack, either because they have all been destroyed or waiting for more to spawn (in Arcade battles, some pilots tend to leave their attackers/bombers as late match reserves), then when at altitude, you can patrol and look for unsuspecting fighters or you can work to lure aircraft up into a stall fight. From your perch, you can start to dip down towards a fighter as if you are going to pounce on it, if they take the bait and climb to meet your MiG-9, then pull up as if you 'chickened-out' and are running, begin a moderate climb with your speed and watch as they follow up, especially watch for the condensation trails coming from their wings, this is a good indication that they are beginning to stall and are an easy target. The MiG-9 has a rather larger rudder and can make use of it for a wing-over manoeuvre which will put you in line with the stalled out target allowing for you to get a quick shot off before returning to your patrol altitude.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful armament allows it to hunt bombers effectively
* All armour is in the front of the aircraft to protect against defensive weapons
* Engines do not overheat at 100% throttle
* Is able to land quite well on engines like in the Me-262
* High rip speed for an early Soviet jet (a little over 1,000 km/h)

'''Cons:'''

* Two different trajectories for both guns
* Limited ammunition of 160 rpg (NS-23) and 40 rpg (N-37D)
* No access to bombs or other payload options
* Underwhelming acceleration
* Unimpressive climb rate
* Control lock starts at around 800 km/h
* Loses a lot of speed during turns
* Very bad turn rate even compared to some jet bombers
* Difficult jet for beginners (hard to use due to its weapons and flight characteristics)
* Mediocre brakes make it hard to land on short airfields

An all-metal, single-seat cantilever monoplane with two turbojet engines, mid-mounted wings, and retractable tricycle landing gear.

It was clear by the end of World War II that the piston-engine-and-propeller combo had reached the limit of its potential. Soon it would be necessary to switch to new engine types.

Jet aviation in the USSR changed for the better at the very end of the war when captured German turbojet engines, particularly the BMW-003, arrived in the Soviet Union. The engine was studied in the shortest time possible, and a Soviet copy, the RD-20, was launched into mass production.

In the end of 1945, the Mikoyan Design Bureau began the development of a jet fighter with two BMW-003 engines (producing 800 kg of thrust). On 24 April 1946, test pilot A.N. Grinchik first flew the prototype I-300 (F-1), the first Soviet fighter with a turbojet engine. The plane reached a speed of 920 km/h and had powerful armament: a 57 mm N-57 cannon and two 23 mm NS-23 cannons.

In 1946, the I-300 began full-scale production and was accepted for service with the Air Force under the designation of MiG-9 (Product FS). Before producing it on a full-scale basis, the designers of the Mikoyan Design Bureau reworked the fighter's construction (particularly its fuselage) from scratch to adapt it to production in large quantities.

The power unit of production MiG-9s consisted of two RD-20 turbojet engines producing 800 kg of thrust apiece. At first, planes of this model had RD-20A-1 engines, with a service life of 10 hours. Actually, these engines were captured BMW-003s, reassembled in the USSR. Subsequently, MiG-9s featured only Soviet-produced turbojet engines: the RD-20A-2, with a service life of 25 and 50 hours, and later the RD-20B, with a service life of 75 hours.

The armament of the production planes differed from that of the prototypes. The MiG-9 (Product FS) had one 37 mm Nudelman N-37 cannon with 40 rounds and two 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23K cannons with 80 rounds each.

In 1947, it was decided to equip the MiG-9 with RD-21 uprated engines producing 1,000 kg of thrust. The engine was uprated due to increased gas temperature and turbine revolutions.

A prototype I-307 (Product FF) aircraft was built and tested with these engines in 1947. The testing showed that the I-307 had higher flight characteristics than production MiG-9s. The I-307 remained a prototype, since in March 1948 a decision was made to start the full-scale production of the more advanced MiG-15.

The last production aircraft were handed over to the Air Force in December 1948, and in factories they were supplanted by a new plane from the Mikoyan Design Bureau, the MiG-15. A total of 602 MiG-9 fighters were produced.

The MiG-9 was the beginning of the jet MiG's history. The success of the MiG-15 fighter all over the world would have been impossible without the experience gained in the processes of design, building, testing, mass production, and operation of the first Soviet jet fighter, the MiG-9.

As new fighters were received by the Air Force, some MiG-9s would be delivered to China. These planes became the first jet fighters of the People's Liberation Army Air Force of China.
{{Navigation-End}}The MiG-9 started its service with the Chinese Air Force in 1950, with a total of 13 fighter divisions being delivered to this country between 1950 and 1951, 9 of which, consisted of MiG-9s. The MiG-9 introduction in the PLAGF was probably due to the quick adoption of the Mig-15 over the Mig-9 in the USSR since the last one became obsolete very quickly and had a large number of reliability issues, especially its armament which could not be fired at the same time and its use was restricted depending on the altitude. 

The Mig-9 suffered a similar destiny in China, with it being quickly replaced with the more modern Mig-15. The main purpose of the Mig-9 was to defend Chinese industrial sectors, as well as its cities from possible attacks, since at this time the PRC was very young and constantly under threat of air raids by the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese, the aircraft however, was mainly used to train new pilots and help them in the transition from propeller aircraft to jet aircraft.
