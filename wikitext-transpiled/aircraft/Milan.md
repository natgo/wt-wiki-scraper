== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' began development in 1968 after the Swiss Air Force expressed interest in acquiring a modified Mirage III with increased manoeuvrability and specialised in tactical support. Thus, the Milan was built, using the Mirage III as a basis but incorporating the weapon systems of the Jaguar. The most significant improvement came in the form of retractable "whiskers" located on the nose of the aircraft, which reduced takeoff distance and provided greater lift. The Milan took its maiden flight on May 29, 1970. However, in 1972, the Swiss Air Force decided to upgrade its Hunters and instead purchase the Northrop F-5.

Introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a capable multirole fighter for its BR, thanks mainly to its sizable payload for ground attacks and powerful engine, as well as access to a ballistics computer for bombs and rockets, which is why it is commonly used as a strike aircraft rather than a fighter in-game. The Milan does suffer from a few drawbacks compared to the Mirage IIIC/E or Mirage 5F, lacking access to the Matra Magic 1 or R530 missile, as well as countermeasures. For air-to-air combat, it is more important than ever to stay fast and launch AIM-9B Sidewinders only at unsuspecting enemies from distances below 2 km, as the missile does not have a very long range.

The Milan was removed from the Gaijin store at the end of the [[wt:en/news/8225-shop-may-sale-in-the-gaijin-store-en|2023 May Sale]]. It was briefly made available for purchase with Golden Eagles {{GE}} for the [[wt:en/news/8356-special-a-decal-and-two-aircraft-for-bastille-day-en|2023]] and [[wt:en/news/8982-shop-special-bastille-day-a-festive-decal-discounts-and-vehicles-for-golden-eagles-en|2024]] "Bastille Day" mini-events.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Milan behaves almost like any other Mirage IIIs in the game. While it can be a little faster than other Mirages, it's also heavier and harder to turn.

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Milan has little to no survivability, its only asset is speed. Yet, at this BR, you will face opponents that are faster and have missiles with 30 G overload factors.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Your only chance to get kills in the Milan is to always stay on top of the battlefield and kill enemies from behind. The Milan can still be considered as a decent bomber for ground RB, having access to CCIP and CCRP you can hunt down any tanks. However, the Étendard does an infinitely better job at that.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Incredible top speed, can hit 1,100+ km/h on the deck
* Customizable loadout options with rockets, bombs, and AGMs
* CCIP/CCRP for bombs, rockets, and guns
* Decent medium speed handling
* DEFA cannons will shred whatever they hit
* Decent cockpit for simulator battles
* Drop tanks (which must be equipped in order to carry bombs or rockets) can be dropped to increase performance in dogfights
* Fast plane, especially for its BR where most planes are subsonic, with bombs which can be dropped above Mach 1

'''Cons:'''

* Mediocre air-to-air missiles
* No countermeasures/RWR
* Horrible energy retention
* Elevators compress at 950+ km/h
* DEFA cannons may be hard to aim
* No radar compared to the other Mirage IIIs in-game

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== [[wt:en/news/7698-development-dassault-milan-the-flying-mustache-en|Devblog]] ===
Development of the Milan began in 1968 when Dassault, in cooperation with Swiss engineers, began working on a modification of the Mirage III, which became known as Milan or 'Kite'. Unlike the standard variants of the Mirage, the Milan received a pair of retractable canards on its nose section in order to improve the aircraft's low speed handling characteristics and shorten take-off distances. In addition, the aircraft was fitted with an uprated ATAR 9K-50 turbojet engine as well as a laser rangefinder.

Dassault manufactured a total of three Milans, basing them both on the Mirage III and Mirage 5. Tests of the various prototypes all showed notable improvements in the areas targeted by the aircraft's modifications. However, the canards also caused issues with the normal operation of the air intakes as a result of their turbulence generation.

Regardless, Milan competed in the Swiss tender against both the A-7G as well as the G.91Y, but failed to impress the Swiss Air Force sufficiently to enter service, same as her competitors though. In 1972, Dassault stopped all further work on the Milan project and shifted its attention to the development which resulted in a more advanced version of the Mirage. The Dassault Milan undertook its final flight in March 1976.

The Mirage Milan represented in the game is a Mirage IIIR (reconnaissance variant) modified to carry canards.
