== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', an advanced variant of the Mirage 2000 series, represents a pinnacle of French aviation technology. Developed by Dassault Aviation, this fighter jet first took its maiden flight in 1991, marking a significant milestone in the country's aerial capabilities. Equipped with state-of-the-art avionics and weapon systems, the Mirage 2000-5F played a pivotal role in various historical conflicts. Notably, during the Kosovo War in 1999, these aircraft showcased their precision and versatility by carrying out crucial ground attack and air-to-air missions. Armed with a range of sophisticated weapons, including Magic 2 air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs, the Mirage 2000-5F demonstrated its adaptability and effectiveness in both aerial combat and ground support roles. Over the years, this fighter jet has solidified its reputation as a cornerstone of the French Air Force's fleet, embodying a harmonious blend of cutting-edge technology and combat-proven performance.

It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]]. The Mirage 2000-5F showcases impressive air-to-air combat capabilities, notably highlighted by its utilization of the Matra Magic 2 missile system. Armed with the Matra Magic 2, an advanced short-range infrared-guided missile, the aircraft excels in engaging close-range airborne targets. The Matra Magic 2 missile's infrared seeker technology enables it to home in on heat sources emitted by enemy aircraft, ensuring accurate target tracking and engagement even in challenging scenarios.

Complementing its missile armament, the Mirage 2000-5F's radar, the Thales RDY (Radar Doppler Multi-target), plays a pivotal role in target detection and tracking. This radar system facilitates rapid target acquisition, enhancing the aircraft's effectiveness in engaging multiple adversaries simultaneously. The Mirage 2000-5F's agility is another critical aspect of its air-to-air prowess, allowing pilots to outmanoeuvre opponents and gain advantageous positions during dogfighting encounters.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Mirage 2000-5F exhibits commendable survivability through a combination of advanced features that enhance its chances of evading threats and successfully completing tasks. One key aspect is its electronic warfare suite, which includes radar warning receivers, chaff and flare dispensers as jamming capabilities. These systems collectively enable the aircraft to detect, identify, and counter incoming threats such as radar-guided missiles and hostile radars. Additionally, the Mirage 2000-5F's advanced avionics and sensors, including the Thales RDY radar and DAMOCLES targeting pod, contribute to its situational awareness, allowing pilots to monitor and respond to potential threats effectively. The aircraft's agility and high-speed capabilities provide pilots with the means to maneuver out of danger swiftly. In terms of design, the Mirage 2000-5F's aerodynamic structure is optimized to reduce its radar cross-section, minimizing its vulnerability to enemy radar systems. This feature, coupled with its electronic warfare systems, helps enhance its overall survivability in contested environments. The Mirage 2000-5F also boasts an impeccably designed and advanced cockpit that significantly enhances its combat capabilities. The cockpit's streamlined layout not only enhances pilot comfort and ergonomics but also contributes to reduced clutter, allowing pilots to focus on mission-critical tasks with heightened efficiency. The cockpit's intuitive arrangement of displays and instruments empowers pilots to swiftly access crucial information and swiftly make informed decisions during high-stress situations. Furthermore, the cockpit's advanced Heads-Up Display (HUD) system projects essential flight data directly onto the pilot's line of sight, eliminating the need for frequent glances down at instruments. This enhances the pilot's ability to maintain spatial awareness and engage targets without diverting their attention from the external environment.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In air-to-air combat scenarios, the Mirage 2000-5F's strengths lie in its exceptional agility and advanced avionics. Employing the Matra Magic 2 short-range infrared-guided missiles and benefiting from the Thales RDY radar, the aircraft can excel in dogfights and engage opponents in close-range encounters. Its advanced radar systems provide pilots with crucial situational awareness, granting them a significant advantage in these high-stakes aerial engagements.

When transitioning to air-to-ground missions, the Mirage 2000-5F demonstrates remarkable versatility. Armed with an array of guided weaponry such as the BGL-1000, PGM-500, PGM-2000, GBU-16, and GBU-12, the aircraft becomes a precise and lethal platform for striking ground targets with pinpoint accuracy. The integration of the DAMOCLES targeting pod significantly enhances the aircraft's ability to deliver laser-guided ordnance, including the AS-30L missile. This pod provides sophisticated targeting capabilities, allowing pilots to designate and guide laser-guided bombs and the AS-30L missile with exceptional precision. The Mirage 2000-5F truly shines when combining its air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities. This synergy is evident in scenarios where the aircraft engages in both roles within a single mission. For instance, in a close air support mission, the aircraft can effectively neutralize enemy ground threats with laser-guided bombs like the GBU-12 or GBU-16, or launch AS-30L missiles at high-value targets, while still retaining the capability to defend itself against potential aerial threats using its Matra Magic 2 missiles and advanced radar systems. This dual-purpose adaptability underscores the Mirage 2000-5F's value as a truly multirole fighter. The Mirage 2000-5F also possesses significant anti-shipping capabilities, bolstered by the use of the PGM-2000, a potent weapon in its arsenal. With its advanced guidance and armour-penetrating capability of up to 111mm, the PGM-2000 is a formidable threat against heavily armoured ships, including aircraft carriers. In War Thunder, aircraft carriers hold strategic importance as power projection platforms in Enduring Confrontation missions. The Mirage 2000-5F's ability to engage and potentially sink these carriers with precision strikes using the PGM-2000 underscores its role, disrupting enemy naval capabilities and potentially reducing the possibility of a mobile spawn point. This multirole versatility reinforces the Mirage 2000-5F's adaptability across various scenarios, making it a crucial asset in shaping battle dynamics.

In summary, the Mirage 2000-5F is a versatile and potent asset that can excel in air-to-air combat, air-to-ground strikes, and combined missions. Its use of guided weaponry, including the BGL-1000, PGM-500, PGM-2000, GBU-16, GBU-12, and AS-30L missile, coupled with the DAMOCLES targeting pod, empowers the aircraft with precise targeting and engagement capabilities. This multirole prowess, combined with its agility and advanced avionics, makes the Mirage 2000-5F a formidable platform capable of adapting to a wide range of operational requirements.
