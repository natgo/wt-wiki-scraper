== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
After the comical failure of the AFVG Anglo-French fighter-interdictor program, and the subsequent further failure of the Mirage G swing-wing prototypes, Dassault got to work on a new generation aircraft for the French Air Force. The resulting aircraft, named the Mirage 2000, took its inaugural flight in 1978. Evolving over the years through various upgrades, the "C" variant stood for "Chasseur", or "Fighter", and was the mainstay of the French Air Force for fighter-interceptor roles for many years.

Introduced during [[Update "Air Superiority"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8644-event-winter-extreme-earn-yourself-rewards-this-festive-season-en|2023 Winter Extreme event]], the Mirage 2000C-S4 is almost completely identical to the tech tree Mirage 2000C-S5, with the only difference being the lack of the Eclair countermeasures pod, lowering the amount of countermeasures it can carry to only 54, compared to the 90 on its tech tree sibling. Otherwise, the aircraft is completely identical, and should be played similarly, relying on its great flight performance, lethal [[Matra R550 Magic 2|R.550 Magic 2]] all aspect missiles, and [[Matra Super 530D]] radar missiles to choose and dictate its engagements.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
It is a small aircraft when compared to similar BR fighters, being less likely to be hit. All fuel tanks are self-sealing and dispersed around the entire wing and mainframe. The relatively small engine less prone to be hit by an enemy, but having a single engine makes it impossible to fly if it is destroyed.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Air AB/RB:'''

For these gamemodes, the Mirage 2000 C-S4 is armed with a small but powerful loadout, that consists of 2 x Matra Magic 2s and 2 x Matra Super R530D SARH missiles, this are very capable options for long range and short range, although the Mirage lacks any kind of weapon for medium range combats. Its radar is mediocre at best, lacking all aspect PD mode, which complicates launching the R530D, but the PD HDN mode and regular SRC mode are enough to deal with enemies at high altitudes and enemies coming directly head-on at you. For overall air-to-air combat, stick close to your friends and to the ground, since missiles like the AIM-7F/M and R-27ER have a longer range than the R530D. Use the Magic 2s at distances around 2 km preferably in side or rear aspect launches, and for BVR combat try to change your lock from PD HDN to SRC and vice versa in case you are loosing the target, take into consideration that your flight performance is very good at speeds around Mach 0.8, and compresses a lot at speeds higher than that, so for dogfights dropping your speed around Mach 0.9-1.0 is a good idea.

'''Simulator battles:'''

For this sort of matches, the small armament of the Mirage 2000 C-S4 becomes less relevant, since in most situations players have to refuel before launching all of their missiles. The Mirage 2000 C-S4 benefits from the ability of being capable of supercruise at high altitudes without heavy external ordinance, this is great for travelling long distances without consuming a lot of fuel, but it makes you vulnerable to radar missiles. A good alternative is only using first stage afterburner, reserving fuel for dogfights or catching up enemies using the full afterburner. In terms of armament being that the Mirage 2000 C-S4 is armed with R530Ds and Magic 2s, it has good armament for short and long range combat, but lacks radar missiles with medium range. The Magic 2 is a very fast short range missile, that can surprise opponents even in head-on situations, while the R530D is a fast and agile although mediocre in range, SARH missile, while it can travel long distances, it will be defeated by the AIM-7F/M or the R-27ER. The Mirage also has a mediocre radar, that lacks a proper all aspect PD mode, when locking a target, switch modes between PD HDN and SRC if you are loosing lock. For scouting the mode TWS HDN is excellent considering that it does not trigger the TRACK warning in the enemies RWR, specially when going straight at the enemy territory, since it minimizes the chances of an enemy not appearing on radar.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Powerful missile options. with Magic 2s and R530Ds
* Great flight performance at medium-high speeds due to the delta wing
* Above average acceleration and supercruise at high altitudes
* Access to a radar with Pulse Doppler mode
* Countermeasures drop 1 by 1, being with 56 total drops if using a single type of countermeasure

'''Cons:'''

* Small missile capacity, with 4 maximum missiles
* Very limited options of ground ordnance
* Poor energy retention
* Small ammo count for the DEFA Cannons
