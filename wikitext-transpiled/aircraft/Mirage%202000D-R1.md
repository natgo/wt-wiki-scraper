== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has just about the same excellent flight characteristics as the 2000C-S5; very responsive engine and flight control surfaces.
* Access to tier 1 countermeasures that give a total of 88 CMs; selection of flare/chaff to your choosing.
* Stock R.550 Magic II all-aspect heat-seekers leaves you with plenty defensive firepower.
* All-round great ground-pounding ordnance, including 4 types of laser guided bombs, 2 types of unguided bombs, and the vastly powerful AS-30L laser guided missiles!
* Thermal camera pod lets you find ground targets with ease in combined battles.

'''Cons:'''

* Relatively heavy when fully loaded with ordnance.
* No integrated guns, nor external gunpods, leaving you with only missiles (max 2) to defend against enemies.
* Carrying countermeasures blocks the drogue chute, meaning landings take more time, especially if landing with ordnance.
* LGB choice is limited to only one of 2x GBU-12, 1x GBU-16, 1x BGL-1000, or 1x GBU-24.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Mirage 2000D (Diversifié, "multi-role") is the attack variant of the Mirage 2000. Originally developed from the 2000N, the 2000D received many attack aircraft features while also retaining some aspects of the later 2000C (Thomson RDI radar and SNECMA M53-P2 engine). The 2000D featured an NVG-compatible cockpit (AN/AVS-9 NVG), better HOTAS, more screens for the pilot and back-seater, Antilope 50 terrain-following system, ICMS 2 countermeasure system, GPS, SERVAL RWR, Chameleon jammer, and Spirale dispensers mounted in the rear of the Karman fairings. In addition to the new avionics, the 2000D could carry all dumb munitions, laser-guided weapons, and the Armat anti-radar missile.

The 2000D was involved with many different conflicts, primarily in Africa and the Middle East. The 2000D was present in Libya, Mali, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. During Operation Harmattan, in conjunction with other fighters, a 2000D dropped 2 laser-guided bombs stopping Gaddafi's convoy, then leading to the capture of Gaddafi and his death. The Mirage 2000D is still in service with France, which is its only operator.
