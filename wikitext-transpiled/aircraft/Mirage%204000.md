== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the 1970s, after the French evaluation of the [[F-15A]] fell through, Dassault took part in a private venture to build a "heavy fighter-interceptor" of similar magnitude as the F-15, primarily for the French Air Force and export to close French allies. By the end of the decade, they had completed the '''Mirage 4000''', which at first glance appeared to be a scaled-up [[Mirage 2000 (Family)|Mirage 2000]] with canards and double the engines. The Mirage 4000 however was more than meets the eye, being armed with a large amount of air-to-air missiles for its interception role, and with powerful SNECMA M53 engines to give it unrivaled thrust for its time, the Mirage 4000 was better than the early F-15As in most ways. However, the French Air Force found the aircraft too expensive to field and decided to pursue further upgrades of the [[Mirage 2000C-S5|Mirage 2000]] instead. As for the export customers, most either bought the F-15A instead due to political pressure, or in the case of Iran, had a revolution which severed the alliance with France and prevented them from buying the Mirage 4000. In the end, only one Mirage 4000 was built, which made 300+ test flights and airshow demonstrations, before being moved to its final resting place at the Musée de l'air et de l'espace (Paris Air and Space Museum) in November 1992. Much of the technology and experience gained from the Mirage 4000 would be used in the Dassault Rafale shortly after.

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], the Mirage 4000 is a direct development of the older Mirage 2000, and the ultimate culmination of the Mirage family. The aircraft can serve a true multipurpose role, having incredible dogfighting performance and up to 8 x [[Matra R550 Magic 2|R.550 Magic 2]] all-aspect missiles for close-in dogfighting, up to four [[Matra Super 530D|Super 530D]] missiles and a powerful radar for BVR combat, and even the ATLIS targeting pod and a respectable amount of laser-guided bombs and AGMs for heavy CAS duty. All in all, the Mirage 4000 serves as a true reward at the end of the French ranks, building upon the playstyles learned from the previous [[Mirage 2000 (Family)|Mirage 2000s]] and the [[F-8E(FN) (France)|F-8E (FN)]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

Just like most other top rank jets, it is very vulnerable to gunfire and missiles alike, meaning it is most important to avoid getting hit at all in the first place. An upside however is that it can stay in the air even with just one engine left and the large airframe makes hits to non-critical components more likely than with tight packed aircraft like the F-16 series for example. Keep in mind that even hits that don't outright destroy you will still make a very noticeable impact on maximum speed and flight performance, rendering a retreat to the airfield the best option in many cases.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The "Super Mirage" is certainly an interesting plane. It is the bigger and stronger brother of the Mirage 2000, that might not have as many aces up its sleeve compared to the Mirage 2000-5F with its HMD and PD radar, but it more than makes up for it thrust, armament and agility.

While the Mirage 4000 is a heavier and therefore less manoeuvrable plane than the Mirage 2000, the addition of the canards and the extra power of the engines make it one of the best turning jets in-game, falling behind only the F-16A in raw manoeuvrability. It however remains a plane that is almost twice as heavy as its little brother, meaning that while it has great thrust, great turning capability and does not lose speed as fast as a Mirage 2000, you will feel that it is way less responsive, especially at lower speeds. 

Overall, the Mirage 4000 is like having 2 Mirage 2000s glued together: twice the weight, twice the engine power, twice the missiles, twice the carrying capacity.

;Air Realistic Battles,

The Mirage 4000 can be used in multiple roles, Including being a missile bus, Support aircraft and even somewhat of a dogfighter. The best way to use the Mirage 4000 in Air RB is to use your high speed to get into a flanking position possibly bombing one base and then firing missiles at unsuspecting enemies. Afterwards, there are multiple possibilities. Either getting away in order to reposition and gain energy, or going straight into the "furball". Both options are possible due to the Mirage's Superior speed, Thrust, Energy retention and agility. The Mirage 4000 is a jack of all trades, being able to fill any role, but not being the best at any of them. You should always keep a good awareness of your surroundings and keep your energy up. Do not get stuck in extended turn fights. 

The Mirage 4000 is as fuel efficient as the Mirage 2000, meaning that 20 minutes is enough if you do not afterburn all the way to the battle. Packing 30 minutes fuel ensures you better endurance, while 40 minutes fuel can extend your endurance further. The Mirage 4000 has multiple options of fuel tanks: either 2 x large drop tanks, with around 20 minutes of fuel; or 2 x smaller fuel tanks, carrying around 4 minutes of fuel can also be installed. These fuel tanks cannot be dropped, they are installed on the innermost armament pylons, but can however hold 2 x Magic II missiles each. In practice, this means that if you wish to take 8 x missiles, you have to take these fuel tanks, which make the plane slightly heavier. If you wish to take 4 x Super 530Ds, You will be limiting yourself to 6 x missiles. The most well rounded loadout for the Mirage 4000 would be the 2 x small fuel tanks, each carrying 2 x Matra Magic II Missiles, 2 x Super 530Ds along with the outer-most pylon Magic IIs, bringing you to a total of 6 x IR missiles and 2 x radar missiles. A payload of 11 x 250 kg bombs can be taken on the pylons under the fuselage, letting you destroy one base. 

;Ground Realistic Battles

The Mirage 4000 is a very scary plane. It can carry a good amount of ordnance. While the ordnance is not fire-and-forget, it packs a punch. A big downside is that the Mirage 4000 only gets access to an ALTIS II targetting pod, which does not have any thermal capability. In practice, this means that the Mirage 4000 is useless at ground pounding if the weather conditions are cloudy, foggy or in low light conditions. Spotting targets is also harder, however the zoom of the ALTIS II is better than on the DAMOCLES targetting pod of the Mirage 2000-5F.
The Most effective loadout for Ground RB is 4 x AS-30L missiles, which are very lethal with a direct hit, and 2 x BGL-1000 laser-guided bombs. 
The first thing you should do after spawning in is searching for enemy SPAA. If you have not identified SPAA in around 5 seconds after spawning in, you should dive and put distance, objects or terrain between you and the battlefield as soon as possible, in order to avoid any possible missiles coming at you. Do keep in mind that a missile can be guided to you even if no one is hard locking you. SPAAs at this tier have IRST and even TWS, making it especially hard to know a missile is fired at you unless you clearly see the launch.
When the threat (SPAA) is eliminated, you can finally start getting close and destroying ground targets. You should constantly keep your eyes on the RWR in case any plane spawns in. 
Try not to turn a lot. The Mirage 4000 becomes very vulnerable once it lost all of its speed. You should do passes and bombing runs rather than staying right above the battlefield and dropping ordnance. 

Overall, the Super Mirage is a truly capable multirole aircraft, that is more than capable at dealing with any situation one might throw at it. This however does not mean that the plane is clearly superior to anything else it might fight, quite the opposite. It just lets the pilot do some things other planes do not. It can be a scary and formidable foe to fight against.

It is a plane with which you can play in your own playstyle, rather than forcing you into a playstyle of its own.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent flight performance in all situations
* Magic 2 missiles are very effective and it carries up to 8 of them
* Has access to Super 530D radar missiles
* Wide variety of air-to-ground weapons, like various (guided) bombs, guided missiles and rockets

'''Cons:'''

* Super 530D missiles lag behind contemporaries like R-27ER and AIM-7M at short range
* Easy to bleed speed in extended turns, at which point it becomes vulnerable to faster foes
* Lack of an HMD
