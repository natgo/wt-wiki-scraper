=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Mirage F1C-200 does not have any armour on the aircraft. Most contemporary cannons such as the [[NR-30 (30 mm)|NR-30]], [[M61A1 (20 mm)|M61A1]], [[Type 30-I]] and [[Gsh-30-I]] on aircraft like the [[F-14 (Family)|F-14]]<nowiki/>s, [[F-16 (Family)|F-16]]<nowiki/>s and [[MiG-29]]<nowiki/>s hitting the aircraft will usually result in critical damage if not an instant death, as is normal at this level of play.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The best phrase that describes this plane would be "Aggressively Mediocre". It isn't in as bad a spot as planes such as the [[F-104S]]/[[F-104S TAF (Italy)|F-104S TAF]] (as of [[Update "La Royale"]]) - where you see frequent uptiers to 12.0 with basically no strengths to work with - but also lacks a strong suit and is essentially incapable of using its radar missiles in matches at a BR where almost everyone has access to some form of SARH or ARH air-to-air missiles. This may lead to some frustrations as the lack of radar missiles and middle-of-the-pack flight performance are going up against the best fighters the game has to offer, but the F1C will still pull through with some effort.

While grinding, the Mirage F1C-200 can be used in two ways; Either as a support fighter with subpar but still adequate (as of Update "La Royale") air-to-air missiles, or as a dedicated base bomber with 2 Matra Magic 2 missiles for self defense. For the support fighter role, it is recommended to take 2 Matra Magic 2 missiles as well as 3 Matra R530Es, with 2 2000lb bombs if you want some extra points. You may choose to fly to the right side of the map on certain maps like Battle for Vietnam where there is sufficient terrain cover that lets you sneak past enemies or launch a Magic 2 at them as you fly away at Mach speeds, or stick with your team flying left, bomb a base and then join the fight with your Magic 2s and guns.  

Players coming from the [[Mirage IIIC]] and [[Mirage IIIE]] may be confused as to why the Matra R530s and Matra Super 530Fs are not recommended, as they offered a very handy front-aspect kill condition on both aircraft at 10.3. However, the problem is that the Mirage F1C-200 is at 11.3, not 10.3, and thus sees an entirely different subset of vehicles that usually all have chaff. The 10.3 Mirages face aircraft which either lack a radar warning reciever to detect the incoming R530 or lack the flare capacity to carry chaff alongside flares, examples being aircraft like the [[Milan]] (in mixed battles), [[A-5C]]<nowiki/>s, [[J35A]]<nowiki/>s, [[Saab J35XS|J35XS]]<nowiki/>s among many, many others. Contrary to those aircraft, the Mirage F1C-200 regularly encounters top tier (12.0 as of [[Update "La Royale"]]) aircraft alongside other 10.7-11.3 premium aircraft, most of which carry superior radar missiles and/or have much better overall flight performance (the [[F-4J Phantom II|F-4J]]/S can carry 4-6 [[AIM-7F Sparrow|AIM-7F]]<nowiki/>s, the [[MiG-23MLA (Germany)|MiG-23MLA]]/[[MiG-23ML|ML]]/[[MiG-23MLD|MLD]] carry 2 midrange [[R-24R]] radar missiles and have a superior airframe for dogfighting etc) as well as having chaff readily available. People will often drop chaff when they are being locked - which against CW seeker missiles won't do much unless they're properly notching the radar - but as the Pulse seekers on the R530/Super 530F are susceptible to chaff they will instantly veer off course and miss their target. As such, it is generally a better idea to load 3 R530Es - the IR variants of the R530s - which do not need a lock to fire and will generally be more reliable. It is to be noted however that the 530Es take a while to accelerate from launch, so keep this in mind when firing the missiles. 

When using the Mirage F1C-200 as a base bomber, it is recommended to load 3 [[2000lb SAMP Mk84|2000lb SAMP Mk.84]] bombs alongside 2 Matra Magic 2 air-to-air missiles, as the 3 2000s can total a base and the Magic 2s being all aspect offer more firing solutions than the alternative Magic 1s equippable in the same slot. Ideal fuel loads are either 20 or 30 minutes, depending on map and preferred playstyle. If you wish to bring less fuel, get into a good position early and then switch to stage 1 afterburner (engaged on PC by scrolling the mouse wheel one tick over 100 or 101% to WEP, which provides additional thrust but does not consume as much fuel as full afterburner), 20 minutes should be suffice - however, if you wish to use full afterburner more liberally or the match is an Enduring Confrontation (EC) match, 30 minutes will generally let you cruise around the battlefield with more freedom. 

Magic 2s will be your bread and butter in the Mirage F1C-200 very often - despite the drag changes adversely impacting their range, when launched within a 1.5-2km (0.93-1.24 mi) or so bubble while gaining on an enemy they will usually have enough energy to connect to the target. Any launch beyond this is undesirable unless the target is turning or losing speed as the missile will quickly bleed its energy, failing to hit its target. In front aspect launches, try to spool up the seeker from ~5km if you know an enemy is inbound - and preferably try and stay behind terrain for as much as possible. This is because many other aircraft carry AAMs that can also front-aspect you be it IR or SARH, and if they decide to fire a missile before you do it can cause your missile to lock onto the in-the-moment hotter AAM, missing its target as their missile sends you back to the hangar. This makes it vital to lock and fire before the enemy has a chance to do the same to you, meaning a last minute firing is ideal. Firing from approximately 2km away is ideal as it is much too close for the enemy to dodge effectively in time.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Availability of [[Matra Super 530F]] and [[Matra R550 Magic 2]] air-to-air missiles
* The Cyrano-IV radar allows low-altitude Pulse-Doppler (MTI) and ACM modes, an upgrade from the previous Mirages (IIIC & IIIE)
* Carries 252 countermeasures
* Large amount of bombs and rockets
* 30mm DEFA cannons will essentially one-tap planes on hit due to their heavy hitting power
* CCIP for bombs, rockets and cannons

'''Cons:'''

* Below average acceleration compared to contemporaries with heavy ordinance
* Mediocre manoeuvrability compared to contemporaries
* The Matra Super 530F missiles are very heavy and strongly impact flight performance
* 30 mm DEFA cannons have a steep learning curve, particularly against high-speed targets
* The Matra R530s and Matra Super 530Fs are easily defeated by chaff, making them hard to use effectively
* No single strength to rely upon unlike other aircraft

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Mirage F1C-200 is essentially a Mirage F1C with an air-refuelling probe. The addition of the air-refuelling probe also extended the length of the fuselage by 7 cm. Some Mirage F1C-200s also received a GPS in the 1990s. These F1C-200s were intended for long expeditionary missions and saw combat in places like Africa and the Middle East. During the early 1980s, Mirage F1C-200s provided air cover for SEPECAT Jaguars performing attack runs against the Libyan-backed insurgency in Chad. A few years later, the F1C-200s and Jaguars were redeployed again to Chad until 1992, when the government was overthrown. Mirage F1C-200s were also present in the United Arab Emirates during the Gulf War to supplement air defense with Qatari Mirage F1EDAs.
The Iraqis took the refuelling probes from the Mirage F1C-200s they had acquired and fitted them on their MiG-23s.
