== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The most effective way of using the Mirage F1C in Air Realistic battles is to play a support role. Try to stay behind your team and target slow and distracted enemies using the powerful air-to-air missiles. Considering the poor top speed and manoeuvrability of the Mirage F1C, it doesn't stand much chance in duels against most enemies, even against uptiered fighters.

The F1C also makes a surprisingly good strike aircraft due to its ability to carry larger bombs compared to its ground-striking peers such as the Mirage 5F or even the Jaguar.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

Every fighter at the BR is a threat for the Mirage F1C because of its slow acceleration and bad elevator and rudder response. Any opposing fighter will outmanoeuvre you.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Availability of Matra Super 530F and R550 Magic 2 air-to-air missiles
- The Cyrano-IV allows low altitude Pulse-Doppler (MTI) and ACM, an upgrade from the previous Mirages (IIIE & IIIC)
- 252 countermeasures
- Decent acceleration at higher speeds

'''Cons:'''

- Very slow acceleration with ordnance
- Poor manoeuvrability at low and high speeds with only "workable" agility at mid speeds
- Low wing-rip speed compared to other aircraft at the rank
- The Matra Super 530F missiles are very heavy and strongly impact flight performance
- 30 mm DEFA cannons are difficult to use, particularly against high-speed targets

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== [[wt:en/news/7610-development-mirage-f1c-a-break-from-tradition-en|Devblog]] ===
In the early 1960s, Dassault Aviation was conducting intense design studies on the basis of the Mirage, resulting in a number of different variations of the aircraft emerging. Among them, a smaller swept wing design of the Mirage outfitted with the latest and more powerful SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine garnered the interest of Dassault engineers as a possible future replacement to the existing Mirage III and Mirage 5 fighters.

Confident in the design, Dassault began conducting further design work under the official name Mirage F1 as part of a private venture. In late 1966, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight and the initial test results proved to be rather positive. In late 1966, the French Air Force also expressed interest in the aircraft and officially adopted the development programme. Subsequently, the Air Force ordered a small batch of pre-production aircraft to be built in April 1967. After Dassault persuaded the Air Force to accept the Mirage F1 into service in order to make the aircraft also marketable to foreign operators, the first production order for the aircraft was issued in 1969.

Entering official service with the French Air Force in March 1974, the Mirage F1 took part in their first combat operations a decade later flying sorties against insurgent forces in Chad. Mirage F1s also took part in French operations during the Gulf War in 1990. In the late 2000s, French Mirage F1s also supported international forces during operations in Afghanistan.

Apart from France, several other nations such as Greece, Spain, South Africa, Qatar, Iraq, Morocco, and many others, operated variants of the Mirage F1.
