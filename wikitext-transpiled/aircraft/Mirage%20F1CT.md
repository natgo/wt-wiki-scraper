== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In July 1984, the new [[Mirage 2000 (Family)|Mirage 2000]] was starting to enter service with the French Air Force to replace the Mirage [[Mirage F1C-200|F-1C-200s]] in the frontline fighter role. As a result, the French Air Force was now left with a lot of leftover Mirage F1Cs to mothball, and in 1988 a program was launched to convert these F1Cs into a frontline ground attack aircraft to replace the ancient Mirage IIIEs and few Mirage 5s used by France in that role at the time. The Mirage F1CT program brought the avionics of the F1C up to the standard of the F1CR (reconnaissance variant), with the radar upgraded to the Cyrano IVM-R standard, adding a plethora of new air-to-ground modes for ground attack. In addition, an improved navigation/attack system outfitted with a laser rangefinder was installed under the nose for low-altitude interdiction, navigation, and the delivery of laser guided ordnance. The defensive suite was also overhauled with a new RWR, enlarged chaff/flare dispensers for SEAD missions, and modernized communication systems were also added. As a result, the Mirage F1CT also gained the ability to carry a variety of air-to-ground weapons, including rockets, cluster bombs and laser-guided bombs, all while retaining the original air-to-air armament of the F-1C fighter variant.

Introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]], the Mirage F1CT acts as the best Mirage F1 variant for air-to-air combat, despite being in the attacker line in the tech tree. This is due to having the better RWR system of all the Mirage F1s. The F1CT can also perform better at air-to-ground than the other models in-game, due to the larger bomb load, allowing it to carry more freefall ordnance. All in all, the F1CT acts as a nice sidegrade to the Mirage F1s in the other parts of the tree, or for people who want a Mirage F1 quickly, a more easily acquirable one from the shorter attacker line rather than the fighter line which the Mirage F1C is found in.

''The Mirage F1, a product of Dassault Aviation's innovation in the 1960s, emerged as a versatile and robust aircraft, complementing the capabilities of the delta-winged Mirage III. Opting for a traditional swept wing design, the Mirage F1 showcased improved range and performance at low altitudes, making its maiden flight in 1966. The aircraft was engineered for simplicity and ruggedness, able to conduct both air-to-air and ground-attack missions with efficiency.''

The Mirage F1's combat debut occurred in the mid-1970s during the Western Sahara War, where French support was provided to Mauritania and Morocco against the Polisario Front rebels. The aircraft's versatility was further highlighted in the 1980s during the Chad-Libya conflict, where the French Air Force utilized it in ground-attack operations.

The Mirage F1 also played a significant role in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, being extensively employed by the Iraqi Air Force. It demonstrated its capabilities in both air-to-air combat and ground-attack missions, with Iraqi pilots claiming air-to-air victories against Iranian aircraft. However, the Gulf War in 1991 presented a challenging scenario for the Iraqi Mirage F1s, as they faced the overwhelming air superiority of the Coalition forces.

The Balkans conflict in the 1990s saw the Mirage F1s of the French Air Force in action once again, conducting reconnaissance and ground-attack missions. It was around this time that the need for a dedicated ground-attack variant became apparent, leading to the development of the Mirage F1CT. This variant was equipped with updated avionics and weapon systems tailored for ground-attack roles, and it participated in NATO operations over the former Yugoslavia.

By the dawn of the 21st century, the Mirage F1 was gradually phased out of frontline service in the French Air Force, with more advanced aircraft like the Rafale taking its place. Nevertheless, the aircraft found new life in other countries and in the private sector, where some were utilized as aggressor aircraft for training purposes. The Mirage F1's extensive service record across various global conflicts stands as a testament to its adaptability and enduring capabilities.
