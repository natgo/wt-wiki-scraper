== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The Mosquito FB Mk VI is a heavy-hitting fighter-bomber that can cover many roles in War Thunder as it could in real life. With the ability to equip bombs and rockets, it can play a part in both the ground and air war. Use its speed and firepower to show the enemies who really rules the battlefield. With the instructions below, an aspiring pilot can make full use of the Mosquito and even squad up because as in the war, a team can never have enough wooden wonders. The Mosquito then goes on to the excellent Tsetse ([[Mosquito FB Mk XVIII|Mk XVIII]]) with the 57 mm cannon for an even better ground attacker.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Mosquito is famed for its outstanding agility in the war, pilots often remarked it as being on par with fighters and nothing like what they had flown before. This was thanks to its light yet strong balsa and plywood frame while housing a pair of Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

In War Thunder, the manoeuvrability can seem far from the legend that surrounds it. When stock, it is a heavy and somewhat cumbersome fighter that relies on slow-moving enemies to target. However, as the upgrades are unlocked and installed it slowly comes out of its shell to start being the plane so many grew up wanting to fly. The roll rate of the Mosquito is quite underwhelming as sometimes expected from such a large aircraft, being best at around 380 km/h (240 mph). The upside is that in the roll, the Mosquito has only a small wobble and so will allow for some well-aimed shots. The horizontal turn on the Mosquito is again not that impressive as one might expect but it is not just a brick with wings either. It has a mediocre turn radius in the flat and can turn with and inside other heavy fighters excluding the Japanese ones. It will undoubtedly not be able to out-turn all its single-engine opponents though with the Fw 190 being the exception in a sustained turn. Finally, the vertical manoeuvrability is decent and the Mosquito will only lose a small bit of altitude in a loop with combat flaps deployed. However, there is one upside. In Simulator battles, the Mosquito is not under the control of the instructor and there is an improvement in its performance. This allows it to be better in the fighter role than in RB if it were in the same matchup.

There is some controversy over the Mosquito though. Many players argue that the Mk VI should be more manoeuvrable than it actually is and this is probably down to two things. Firstly the flight model may be inaccurate in the respective area causing it not to perform as well, but the most likely reason for the performance is the large fuel minimum. At 1 hour it has a large effect on what the plane can do. This is a little less than double that of similar planes that have 45 minutes of fuel.

It is a good idea to set the compressor to the 2nd position while not using WEP at low altitudes in Realistic Battles. This will prevent the engines overheating, and will generate almost as much power as they do on 1st compressor's position with WEP. This will maximize motors' efficiency, especially because there is no need to open the radiator and increase drag.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

'''To pursue the "Fighter" role:'''

Firstly unlock the ammo belt for the cannons (as can see each belt below). This will unlock the Air targets/Universal belts, significantly improving the firepower. Next, go for the "Radiator" module, this will improve the WEP capabilities and +4 mph. The third should be the "Fuselage repair" further increasing the performance and this will also unlock tier II. Immediately go for the "Compressor". It gives a solid boost to all the performance abilities in both speed and manoeuvrability. Following this, the cannon upgrades should be next to give more accuracy and ability to fire longer bursts (more useful in AB). As two modifications are only needed in this tier, tier III will now be unlocked. "Engine" should be unlocked before "Wings repair". This will give more horsepower and a better climb rate with "Wings repair" coming after. Access to tier IV is now achieved and without a doubt, the next modification should be "Engine injection". This will give the biggest increase in all performance areas with up to +34 mph, +13.9 climb rate and -2.8 turn time. "Cover" should come next. Now that all the tiers are unlocked, unlock "Airframe" further increasing the durability and lightening the plane. Now focus on the cannons to get the Mk.II 1942 and 1943 modifications. Now work on the pylons to gain access to the rockets, these are useful against bombers and will also give the Mosquito ground attack versatility. Finally, upgrade the 7.7 mm machine guns thus "Spading" the Mosquito.

Offensive 20 mm -> Radiator -> Fuselage repair -> Compressor -> New 20 mm cannons -> Engine -> Wings repair -> Engine injection -> Cover -> Airframe -> Mk.II year 1942 -> Mk.II year 1943 -> SBC mk.II (250 lb) -> MBC mk.II (500 lb) -> RSC mk.II (rockets) -> Uncle Tom -> Offensive 7 mm -> New 7 mm MGs

'''To pursue as a ground attacker:'''

Like the fighter path firstly get the 20 mm cannon belts. This gives the Ground targets belt that can be used against light pillboxes and medium tanks. Next, go for the "Radiator" as it gives a better upgrade than the "Fuselage repair" and gives the engine more WEP time. Now get the "SBC mk.II" pylons to unlock the 250 lb bombs, although these bombs are useless they will unlock tier II and give access to the 500 lb bombs. The "Compressor" should be researched before the "MBC mk.II" pylon to make it easier to get about with the 500 lb bombs. Before researching tier III, research the "New 20 mm cannons" to make it easier to hit targets. Now unlock the new engine for more speed and manoeuvrability and "RSC mk.II" rockets after that. With tier IV unlocked, prioritize the "Engine injection" as it is the most valuable upgrade and "Cover" after that. Get the Uncle Toms for a bonus ordnance option, then go back to the "Airframe" as it will make the Mosquito more durable and "Wings repair" after that will give better performance overall. For the last few upgrades, unlock both remaining cannon upgrades to give better accuracy in firing. Finally, research the "Fuselage repair" then the 7.7 mm to finish the Mosquito grind.

Offensive 20 mm -> Radiator -> SBC mk.II (250 lb) -> Compressor -> MBC mk.II (500 lb) -> New 20 mm cannons -> Engine -> RSC mk.II (Rockets) -> Engine injection -> Cover -> Uncle Tom -> Airframe -> Wings repair -> Mk.II year 1942 -> Mk.II year 1943 -> Fuselage repair -> Offensive 7 mm -> New 7 mm MGs

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, chin-mounted (150 rpg = 600 total)
- 4 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 2,000 total)

The Mosquito VI has a fixed forward-mounted armament of four 7.7 mm Browning machine guns and four 20 mm Hispano Mk.II both with a variety of belts. For the machine guns, the Universal belt is highly recommended as it suits both ground attack and air combat although only for the use of tracers in the latter. Use the machine guns for ranging and attacking light targets, don't waste the cannons on those. The cannons are specific to their role, so a pilot may want to think about what role the Mosquito will be flown as before spawning. In the ground attack role, the "Ground targets" belt is the obvious choice for the cannons as 60% of the ammo is armour-piercing. This ammo can destroy targets up to light tanks (attack from behind) and light pillboxes (through windows and doors). For anti-air, the belt of choice is "Air targets". This ammo makes light work of any aircraft. "Stealth" can also be used as it does not contain any Tracer component, sometimes allowing the Mosquito to sneak attack unsuspecting opponents. This is also why the "Universal" belt in the machine guns are useful as it allows the Mosquito to adjust its aim while using "Stealth" belts.

The cannons are mounted under the nose and so will need more lead than wing-mounted Hispanos, but the close grouping makes it far less affected by convergence. To use the cannons to attack ground targets, go into the virtual cockpit to gain the best accuracy. For tanks, line up behind them at least 0.6 km away and low to the ground. Begin to fire at the target at about 0.4 km, by aiming for the top armour of tanks and the back of the turrets as these areas are more likely to be penetrable. As for light pillboxes, these are stationary targets so they will be easier to destroy and so don't need as much setting up. Aim for the back of the pillbox or the window at the front. Of course, the Mosquito will need ground target ammo to penetrate the armour of both targets. Flaps should be deployed as they will help the plane elevate quicker and stop it from crashing into trees or buildings. The tactics and knowledge built from this will then come in very useful when playing the Mk XVIII as it is an even better ground attacker.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|G.P. Mk.IV (250 lb)|G.P. Mk.IV (500 lb)|RP-3|Uncle Tom}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 2 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (500 lb total)
- 2 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,000 lb total)
- 8 x RP-3 rockets
- 4 x Uncle Tom rockets

The 250 lb bombs are only useful in the hands of a skilled dive-bomber pilot as most targets need a direct hit or both 250 lb bombs to destroy them. The 500 lb is a better choice as it gives some leeway if the target is only slightly missed; they can also sink destroyers in one direct hit. To attack with bombs, line up with the target >1 km out and change to the virtual cockpit. Dive on the target at 30 degrees or more with the steeper the dive the better. Release the bomb at around 300 m above the target, this should give the Mosquito enough time to pull out of the dive and not blow itself up. Bombs are recommended for pillboxes and stationary targets above all else. Rockets can be used both for anti-bomber as well as anti-ground. The rockets can also be used against destroyers and pillboxes, although the Mosquito will need four rockets to hit to destroy them, allowing a player to attack two such targets with each loadout. Note when attacking ships come at their broadside at around -30 degrees, this will allow the gun sights to aim at the largest target.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Mosquito is one the best multi-role planes in the game due to its many redeeming aspects even at its high BR. The Mk VI is at home as both a ground attack aircraft and a heavy fighter with the ability to easily switch roles in battle. Firstly, the plane packs a devastating punch with the quad 20 mm and can snipe pretty well due to its nose-mounted guns. This makes it a brilliant anti-bomber aircraft, especially with rockets. It is also decent against other heavy fighters, but never expect an easy fight (although the same could be said for the enemy). It can outrun a [[Bf 109 G-6]] at low altitude, although this doesn't mean a pilot should always avoid using it as a fighter. With its rockets or 500 lb bombs, it can deal with 2 pillboxes while the cannons with ground ammunition can destroy light pillboxes and medium tanks from behind, and the MGs can then tear up soft targets making it an awesome ground attack aircraft. The only real major downside is that the flight model and weapons profile match that of the series 1 Mk VI Mosquito. This means that the engines and the payload are both worse (less powerful Merlin 21 engines instead of the 25, and no external bomb storage) than what they would be if this was the series, two models, instead.

'''Arcade Battles'''

In Arcade the best loadout will be the 500 lb bombs, with the artificial crosshairs it makes dive-bombing very accurate and easier to use than the rockets, they also have more flexibility in targets. The rockets aren't as good in Arcade due to the crosshairs making bombs the more accurate ordnance however they can still be useful for taking out bombers quickly and somewhat brutally providing they are well aimed. The cannon ammo will probably favour the universal belt as a pilot has to be ready to diversify the Mosquito's role when playing in Arcade matches moreso than in RB/ SB. For attacking aircraft, bombers are a good target as the Mosquito can take some punishment (although not to the engines) and will quickly deal with the bombers with its cannons. For fighters, stay fast and use it like a Beaufighter to quickly destroy a target and get out, do not get caught up in dogfights.

The best mode is Ground strike for Arcade, this gives a few choices that the Mosquito can undertake. Firstly the anti-bomber role can be played to stop the opposing team base rushing the match to a quick end. It will also provide plenty of air targets while little interference from other fighters. The second is to pray on the low and ground attacking aircraft or the enemy aircraft that are attacking the friendly ground strike aircraft as they will also be low and vulnerable. Attack these by "Boom and Zoom" tactics as turning will slow the Mosquito down and make it an easy target. Finally, the Mosquito can perform ground strikes itself. The 500 lb bombs will hit the heaviest of targets and destroy them while also being very accurate with the bombsight. Once these payloads are released, the Mosquito can shift and engage in normal fighter combat, but this will be riskier.

Domination mode is a good mode if a bit of luck is added. Stay high and above the fight and pick off enemies that present an easy target (like capping an airfield or at the top of a loop). Again use diving attacks to stay at an advantage over other enemy aircraft and engage from as far out, the domination mode does allow for some ground attack gameplay but it is only recommended for the plane to make one pass then engage fighters and other aircraft.

The air domination mode. This is the worst mode for the Mk VI as there will always be high altitude players and few bombers to prey on. The only safe way to play this mode is to take targets of opportunity while keeping a reasonable height. However, there is always the tactic of going in headfirst and with a whole lot of luck having an amazing game.

'''Realistic Battles'''

The approach into battle is dictated by what the role want to achieve in that game. For heavy fighters, climb into battle to obviously get altitude and hopefully be above the enemy, however, this is hard to achieve due to the bad climb rate. Climb at around 150 mph/ 240 kilometres per hour*, WEP from takeoff allows the Mosquito to climb at 180 miles an hour/ 290 km an hour* at around 15 degrees. Also, side climbs until around 2,500 m. At this altitude, the water will start to overheat and so release the WEP and lower the angle to 10 degrees to keep the speed up. At around 3,500 m, begin to climb into the battle area maintaining the 10 degrees angle of attack. This will take the Mosquito to the same altitude as the bombers or just below the highest enemy players (the plane by now should be at a minimum of 4,500 m). This should allow the Mosquito pilot to engage the targets as desired.

For ground attackers, go for a more unconventional approach. Fly low to the ground and use the terrain to the advantage to avoid being seen, never above 400 m of the ground. Fly around the map and not through the middle this will stop the Mosquito flying into enemy view ranges and to get the target unnoticed. Avoid going to the map edges as this will be a waste of time for everyone. Alternate history Krymsk is a good example of this. As on takeoff, stay low to the sea and fly close to the mountains on the right. As the destroyers come in range the then fly in between the mountains and to avoid being shot down by them. The Mosquito will then be able to attack the enemy pillboxes without the enemy knowing until the first few ground targets have been destroyed.

Using the Mosquito is quite difficult due to its enemies and its own rather lacking speed. Keep the plane's speed up and don't dogfight if possible as any fighter will be able to get on the six of the Mosquito. The best way to play the Mosquito is like most other heavy fighters, and that's to do single diving attacks and get as much damage in as possible. To make full use of the Mosquito, use Air targets belts for the cannons and open fire at around 400-500 m. Take appropriate aim but remember the cannons are mounted under the nose so they require a bit more lead than nose-mounted ones. The reason for shooting at a long distance is that usually the enemy will only just start to react and so the shot will be easier than a close-range snapshot. Use vertical manoeuvres to engage an opponent, but if the Mosquito is at a higher energy state or barrel roll to get some more deflection shots. The best targets are other heavy fighters, attackers and best of all are bombers. The Mosquito is somewhat manoeuvrable and so can dogfight if needed but it will be a hard fight. Scissors are an option depending on the opponent but aren't recommended - these can be used on other heavy fighters or Fw 190s if they try and follow the Mosquito in flat turns.

To defend against a diving opponent, apply downwards rudder and then immediately apply some roll. This will throw most of the initial shots of the target and cause the enemy to react quickly or pull off for another attack. The Mosquito can also begin a flat turn with combat flaps deployed. Then once they are about to enter firing range apply full upwards elevator and have the Mosquito roll under itself but elongate the roll slightly. If they overshoot, they will either go vertical or carry on in their bearing. If they go vertical, begin a flat turn and react to what they do next. If they immediately begin the other attack, roll out of the way or, if the Mosquito has the height advantage, do a Split-S in hope of throwing off their attack. There is not much that one can do to get back on the offensive so just focus on being defensive and call for help. If they do overshoot and carry on their bearing without climbing, try and take a few ranging shots as there is a chance of hitting the enemy as they leave, but the window of opportunity will only be open for a short period of time.

'''Simulator Battles'''

The Mosquito in SB is probably the best mode to play it in for it to play as a ground attacker, and this is due to a few very good reasons. Firstly it is a very stable gun platform- This makes it easier to use in mouse aim and for beginners as it doesn't wobble as other planes would. The stability allows the Mosquito to fire the rockets or drop the bombs accurately (although still follow the same procedures as above in dive-bombing and rocket attacks). The game mechanics of SB are also in the Mosquito's favour, because flying low to the ground and there is no spotting system except for close proximity allies, the Mosquito will be a lot harder for the enemy to see against AB and RB. also being low to the ground will make it easier spotting the enemy, so-called by the SB aviators as "spot the dot", and the fully glazed canopy will also give the Mosquito's pilot excellent vision (it is best to bound the head's X and Y axis keys to make full use of this). As a fighter, it is also quite decent as long as the Mosquito goes up against aircraft around its battle rating. Even when stock it can manoeuvre with a Fw 190 in turns and keep up with one in a short dive. The stable gun platform makes it easier to aim and hit the target from longer ranges. There are downsides, however, as the targeting sight is located to the right of the default view meaning a Mosquito pilot would have to keep on zooming in to see the sight or move the head along the X-axis to see is in normal view. The second is that the artificial horizon has been covered up by the same gun sight. The final downside is that it has a somewhat high stall speed on landing and is quite high up for an aircraft. This makes it difficult to land and can result in an easy prop strike for new pilots flying it. Lastly, it is also recommended to have a wingman in this mode, be that another Mosquito or something like a Typhoon to cover the Mosquito when a more manoeuvrable fighter gets on its back. Just remember to not take any plane above the Mosquito's own battle rating.

The Mosquito in Sim is a slightly different plane to what it is in RB. The manoeuvrability is somewhat improved with the lack of an instructor allowing it to dogfight more effectively. The plane can stick to opponents a lot easier and have a higher chance of winning. Against Fw 190s, the Mosquito can be a very good adversary as in real life and it can cause problems for 109s. Against the Japanese however, it is totally outclassed. All of the Japanese fighters will outmanoeuvre the Mosquito, so like in all other aircraft, don't turn with these. The Mosquito can perform scissors somewhat better and it has very forgiving flying characteristics and pulls off some more advanced manoeuvres more sharply.

As mentioned above, the Mosquito has a rather high stall speed, making it easy to crash onto the runway when landing. If a pilot uses the same approach of cutting throttle and using landing flaps during touch down, the Mosquito is very likely to heavily smack into the ground, snapping its gears and causing a failed landing. The trick is to maintain higher speed when landing. Align the Mosquito with the runway about 1 km away, with an altitude of around 150 m. While approaching the runway, use 40-60% throttle and drop speed to around 230 km/h, and deploy combat/takeoff flaps and landing gears. When barely flying above the ground, make sure that the speed is still well over 190 km/h and descend very, very slowly. Only now should the Mosquito deploy its landing flaps. The huge body of the Mosquito allows it to decelerate quickly, so don't worry about not having enough runway just because the plane approached fast. When taxiing, fully deflect elevators upwards and brake. Release brakes immediately as soon as the nose dips down to avoid propeller strike.

- '''Tracers:''' {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}{{-}}{{Annotation|T|Tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-I|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary}} - Another all-round belt, but for those that are not confident with their aiming. These tracers can help with practice so that pilots can know how to adjust their shots with other belts. It can destroy armoured and air targets, but is by no means the best for either (Bad for stealth attack).
- '''Stealth:''' {{Annotation|HEF-I|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-I|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-SAPI|High-explosive fragmentation (semi-armour-piercing incendiary)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}} - Much like the Air targets belt but without the Tracer bullet for a completely invisible belt.

=====Attack methods=====
'''How to dive bomb in the Mosquito'''

Although the basics are the same for dive-bombing in general, the Mosquito has no air brakes and a low red-line speed making speed management very important. This also stops the plane from getting very steep angles, as it runs a very high risk of crashing. If not cautious, the dive can cause the plane either red-line and the wings will rip off, or be a victim of control stiffening. Learning the Mosquito's limits is necessary to understand what sort of diving angle is best to deliver bombs via dive-bombing.

Approach the desired target at around 1,000 m (3,000 ft) altitude, anymore and the Mosquito will start to over-speed in the dive and any less won't give enough time to aim. Fly true to the target but keep an eye on it with the target lock. Once the target is at the bottom of the screen, cut the throttle and begin the dive. Begin at -30° for the first 400 m (1,200 ft) then angle down to -40°/-45°. This should bring the gun sights over the target, although a little adjustment will need to be made as every situation is different. Release the ordnance 300 m from the ground and pull up. Bring the throttle to WEP and climb out at +30° and level off when comfortable (+30° gives the most altitude for the speed in tests).

'''How to use the rockets on the Mosquito'''

Unlike dive-bombing where the Mosquio has to be slightly different to control its dive speed, a player can use the same techniques with the rockets as they would in any other aircraft. The thing to watch out for on the Mosquito is the wide wingspan making it less forgiving on when they converge. However, this isn't a massive hindrance. Tanks are hard to hit unless the player is well-practiced with the rockets. Therefore, the two types of targets that the rockets should be used on are both naval and stationary land targets.

For ships, treat a rocket attack run similarly to a dive-attack as mentioned above, with a few changes. At any altitude between 600 m and 1,000 m (although 1,000 m is recommended), line up to the ship's broadside, level out and switch to the virtual cockpit. Begin the dive once the ship is near the bottom of the screen, aiming for about -35° angle of attack, but dive at an angle where the crosshair can be kept on target. At 250-300 m, fire the rockets and then pull up for a climb angle at 30°. Adjust again if needed to allow the Mosquito to recover for its next course of action.

The second way is the more common attack. Come in low to the ground and level out by at least 800 m away. Deploy combat flaps to give the plane more lift and so the Mosquito will be able to pull up easier and will also give the Mosquito the ability to bring the nose down a bit more. Once the plane is at the convergence range fire the rockets and pull up. This is a more simple attack and will be easier after a few attempts.

====Counter-tactics====

<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->

A Mosquito can be very deadly if dealt with wrong, but just remember a few simple things about it and it can be attacked with little problems. Note that this is mostly for RB/SB

Firstly what not to do.

Never head-on attack one. The Mosquito's firepower will shred any plane apart due to the nose-mounted cannons and the Hispanos doing a high amount of damage, even Fw 190s should stay away from this. Also, like the first try not to overshoot and fly in front of it, the cannons can still get an enemy from far out.

Now how to attack one.

A propeller plane around the Mosquito's battle rating will likely be faster and more manoeuvrable, which are traits that should be utilised against the sluggish Mosquito. If one is coming from behind, do a Split-S and roll under it. The average roll rate on the Mosquito (especially at higher speeds) will make it so the guns have less chance of hitting its target. Try to out-turn the Mosquito (unless in an Fw 190 or a Bf 109 with gun pods). Use this to get on its 6 o' clock or, if necessary, dive away (its red-line begins at 401 mph).

As the Mosquito was made from wood, it can take some beating before going down. If tailing the enemy Mosquito, then aim for the engines as they are easily damaged and the fire will spread due to the wood frame and the fuel tanks being in close proximity and spanning both wings. Keep energy up while fighting the Mosquito by using vertical manoeuvres as then it won't be able to engage properly. If there is a squad of Mosquitoes, then don't underestimate their ability and only attack when the opportunity presents itself.

'''Pros:'''

- Agile and responsive
- Four nose-mounted cannons
- Good amount of ammunition
- Stable gun platform
- Usable payload
- Cockpit has good visibility
- The four Browning machine guns allow the plane to stay in combat after the cannon ammo is expended

'''Cons:'''

- Large default fuel load
- Large engines are prone to damage
- Wooden airframe can't take as much damage as other all-metal fighters
- Copilot/navigator appears to not count in damage model, so losing the front pilot will mean a plane loss
- Flaps appear to tear at lower speeds than that of most other aircraft
- Cannons overheat easily

=== Development ===
The Mosquito began life in a more than a shaky start. In 1936 the Ministry issued Specification P.13/36 that stated a twin-engine bomber that could carry a payload of 3,000 lb for 3,000 miles while having a maximum speed of 275 mph. It was also stated that it should also carry 8,000 lb at shorter ranges. Geoffrey de Havilland sent a letter to an Air ministry council member Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman stating that a high-speed bomber could be made out of wood and powered by RR Merlin engines as there would be a shortage of strategic metals in a war. However, Freeman replied that it would fall short of the specification by either bomb load or speed both of which were important.

De Havilland believed that the adjustment was too large and that he should design the new bomber with no unneeded equipment. He began to base his new design on the DH. Albatross airliner. He would add a tail turret and around two manual guns to the design and replace the power plants with Merlin X engines. There would be a crew of 3 and a top speed of 300 mph. Although de Havilland still believed the design could be improved more and looked at other designs based on the albatross.

The new design would be more aerodynamic, wooden and powered by the Merlin engine. He also wanted to remove any gun turrets to make less weight and manufacturing easier. It would also be manoeuvrable to make it easy to avoid fighters and future fighters. However, the design was the opposite of the Air Ministry's current ideology and so little interest was shown. By the 4th of October 1939, the design had become a fast twin-engine light bomber and had moved to the secure location of Salisbury Hall for further work. However, the design was still too radical for the Air Ministry. The outbreak of war made the now DH. 98 a bit more attractive but the lack of defensive armament still made the Air Ministry cautious of the design. A small remote-controlled turret was added at the back of the cockpit to please the Ministry. On the 12th of November, a meeting between the Air Ministry and the aircraft companies de Havilland showed that his design could reach 500 mph and so was able to drop the requirement for a turret.

A month later the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, Director General of Research and Development, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command had a meeting to see where the DH.98 could fit into RAF service. the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command refused the design for a fast bomber but instead believed it would fit in as a photo-reconnaissance aircraft. On the first of January, the DH.98 received backing after a mock-up was inspected resulting in an order of a prototype. Two months later in March 50 bomber reconnaissance variants were ordered and the May specification of F.21/40 resulted in the cannon-armed fighter variant. The fighter variant kept the mosquito alive due to its performance numbing the criticism from the government and Air Ministry even after it had shown its performance.

===Operational duties of the Mk.VI===
The Mosquito VI was the most mass-produced variant with 2,298 being the final score. The VI was one of Britain's primary attack aircraft and so gained fame in its low-level bombing missions against Axis forces, pilots often told of the mosquito having almost "fight like agility" and the ability to even take on single-engine fighters if needed (as some Fw 190s from Jagdgeschwader 5 found out). Its main weapon was its speed topping out at 384 mph allowing it to do high-speed hit and run attacks with little chance of being caught.
The First Mosquito VI was developed from the Mk.II, a fighter variant. As the Cannons only took up the front half of the bomb bay the rear half could be was refitted with bomb racks to hold two 250 lb or 500 lb bombs. It also had the ability to carry 8 x 60 lb rockets with 4 per wing. The first prototype flew on the first of June 1941 powered by two 1,460 hp Merlin 21's, this was then upgraded to Merlin 25's with an output of 1,635. The prototype however performed under its expected speed only reaching 368 mph when the aircraft was fitted with "saxophone" exhausts. Stub exhausts were then fitted and a retest found the performance boot to 384 mph bringing the performance back to the expected figures. The series II modification allowed two 250 lb/500 lb bombs or fuel tanks.

The Mk. VI was used as the RAF's primary strike aircraft with the ability to attack targets with the accuracy that could never be achieved by the four-engine heavy bombers. Its speed allowed it to make fast runs into occupied Europe, attack a target and return with little chance of being intercepted. The speed even made it viable for daylight runs with low loss rates that would be impossible for four-engine bombers too. It served with many squadrons including the famed 617 "Dambusters" and other air forces around the world in and after the war. It also had a life of being a pathfinder by reaching the target before the heavy bombers did and dropping incendiary bombs on the target that could then be seen the Bombardier to aim for. The wooden profile also made it hard to detect on German radar thus improving its survival rate. The VI was also employed as a night fighter to intercept landing bombers and even enemy night fighters. The Mosquito gain its fame and legendary status with its very high survival rate, versatility and its famous daring low-level bombing

The Mosquito had many famous exploits as depicted in post-war films, with some better than others. The two most famous ones featuring the VI were Operation Jericho and interrupting old Goering. Operation Jericho was the RAF's attempt at bombing Amiens Prison in early 1944 and was one of the most daring attacks although it's often questioned if the attack was needed. In the attack, the bombs hit the guard's barrack as well as breaching the Prison's walls however this did come at a cost. 102 prisoners were killed with a further 74 injured. However, 258 escaped of whom 78 were resistance or political prisoners but around 182 of these were later captured. in the attack out of the 9 Mosquito's 3 were shot down with 3 crew KIA and three taken prisoner. Of the three KIA one was the commander Group Captain Percy Charles "Pick" Pickard (DSO & Two Bars, DFC) and his navigator. The Raid was highly criticized and the reason for the raid or the objective for it has never been found

The Mosquito also lived up to its name by being a nuisance to none other than Herman Goering. On the 31st of January 1943, Goering proudly proclaimed that no enemy aircraft will bomb Berlin however during his speech to a large parade he was cut off when a squadron of mosquito's bombed the broadcasting station interrupting the speech.

The Mosquito ended its career with many nicknames including "Mossie", "Termite's dream", "the timber terror" and most famously "The wooden wonder". However, the one that probably suited it most was "All things to all men". This encapsulates the mosquito's effect of not only being adored by its pilots and crew but the admiration the British public gave it from its ability to be such a morale-boosting plane. To be honest the best quote ever said about the mosquito came from none other than Goering himself ''"In 1940 I could at least fly as far as Glasgow in most of my aircraft, but not now! It makes me furious when I see the Mosquito. I turn green and yellow with envy. The British, who can afford aluminium better than we can, knock together a beautiful wooden aircraft that every piano factory over there is building, and they give it a speed which they have now increased yet again. What do you make of that? There is nothing the British do not have. They have the geniuses and we have the nincompoops. After the war is over I'm going to buy a British radio set - then at least I'll own something that has always worked."''

A twin engine monoplane which entered service with the Royal Air Force in 1941, the de Havilland Mosquito was originally conceived as a high speed bomber/reconnaissance aircraft whose performance would be so outstanding that defensive armament was not required. When its plans were originally drawn up in the autumn of 1938, a second alarming feature was conceived – to save materials for other war machines, the Mosquito would be made of largely of wood. This concept was perhaps too advanced for the British Air Ministry, and it was not until after the beginning of the Second World War that de Havilland's plans were seriously considered. The prototype first flew in November 1940, and shortly after astounded any sceptics by demonstrating a top speed of just under 400 mph and an exceptional manoeuvrability for its size.

The first Mosquito to enter service, the PR Mk I, was a photographic reconnaissance aircraft which, like the original plans, was unarmed. On its first operational sortie over occupied France, it easily outran three Messerschmitt 109s. The second major production variant was the B Mk IV, a bomber with the range to reach Berlin.

For the first major fighter-bomber variant, the Mosquito FB Mk VI, the airframe was based on the F Mk II and first flew on June 1st 1942.

The first series of Mosquito FB Mk VI Srs.1 aircraft (300 in number) were equipped with a liquid cooled engine, the Rolls-Royce Merlin Mk21, Mk23, or later the Mk25. The aircraft were armed with four fuselage-mounted 20 mm British-Hispano Mk II cannons and four 0.303 inch Colt-Browning Mk II machine guns. In addition, the aircraft inherited the F Mk II's capacity for carrying two 250 lb (113 kg) bombs on underwing pylons. The internal bomb bay was completely filled with the aircraft's weaponry and an extra fuel tank.

The FB Mk VI Srs.2, the second production series, was fitted with the Merlin Mk 25 engine, guaranteeing the best possible performance characteristics at low and medium altitude. The internal fuel tank was removed so that the aircraft could carry 250 lb bombs in its internal bomb bay, plus two 250 or 500 lb (227 kg) bombs carried externally. A further option was to mount extra fuel tanks under the wings instead of bombs, carrying 50, 100, or 200 gallon (227, 455, or 909 litres) of fuel, or eight 25 or 60 lb rockets. The aircraft's cannons and machine guns remained unchanged.

The FB Mk VI first saw combat on October 3rd 1943. The aircraft was widely used in the precision strike role against especially important targets. From 1944 on, the FB Mk VI was used by the RAF Coastal Command and saw action over the Bay of Biscay, the North Sea, the English Channel, and over the rivers of France, Belgium, and Germany.

The FB Mk VI was the most widely produced of all Mosquito variants during the war; factories managed to produce 2,584 aircraft. All in all, 6,710 Mosquitoes (from all series) were manufactured. According to General Bennett, the only drawback the "wooden wonder" had was that there were never enough of them. After a hugely successful wartime career, the Mosquito continued to serve with several nations well into the 1950s.
