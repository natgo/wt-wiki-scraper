== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The Mustang Mk IA is equipped in the same manner as the American [[P-51|original P-51]] with four 20 mm cannons in the wing and Allison engine. The Mustang Mk IA takes on a two-tone desert camouflage as default with a light blue underbelly, making it quite distinguishable in the airspace. Distinguishable identifications towards the Royal Air Force are seen with roundels on the wings and rear fuselage, with a red, white, blue fin flash.

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (125 rpg = 500 total)

The Mustang Mk-1A is similar to its bigger brother (or in some ways smaller) in the fact that it carries many good and bad traits. Interestingly, it inherits much of the advantages of the P-51D while adding some of its own good characteristics. High altitude performance is miserable, but it won't get there any time soon with the sluggish climb rate. Top speed is very good, yet achieving it can take some time due to the slow acceleration. Low-altitude manoeuvrability is decent.

The Mk-1A is equipped with four Hispano 20 mm cannons, making it a formidable firing platform. However, these cannon will run out of ammo, due to the sparse 125 rpg. They will jam quickly too. Take advantage of the cannon though, because when compared to other nation's counterparts the MK-1A can make rapid kills of any plane. Air targets belts are recommended for experienced players; they possess the most HE shells out of any belt, but lack tracers. Unlike in the [[Typhoon_Mk_Ib/L|Typhoon]] series, the guns on the Mustang are mounted in close proximity, dealing a deadly double punch when hitting. Very similar to the [[Spitfire Mk Vc|Spitfire Mk.Vc]] which has 5 rounds per gun less than the Mustang.

Unfortunately, the Mustang Mk-1A is not a great Boom & Zoom fighter nor a great turn-fighter; it is a trade-off between the great high-altitude performance of the P-51D and its own average all-altitude performance. The top speed is only middling, although top speed and dive-speed are excellent. Climb rate is relatively poor, at only 13 m/s. To top that off, it has an average turn-rate as well. Thus, the Mk-1A is a great plane for head-ons, tail-end combat, and in very few cases, turn fighting. At low altitudes, turning is very snappy provided you have the speed. The engine is prone to overheating relatively (and annoyingly) quickly in realistic and simulator battles. Additionally, a small amount of damage taken by the engine can result in its destruction, which is problematic while attacking bombers. Additionally, the cockpit is a great downfall, as it provides poor visibility.

A Mustang with altitude is a dangerous Mustang. Try to take out a Mustang, you must do what you can to rob it of its altitude advantage by either climbing above it or bringing it down to the Earth. The latter can be easily done if the Mustang pilot is aggressive and will eagerly tail an enticing target in a dive down to low altitude. In this case, one can rely on bleeding the Mustang of its speed as it pursues its target or when it returns to a climb and use this opportunity to pounce the Mustang.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Punishing armament of four Hispano Mk.II
- Amazing acceleration at low altitude
- Good top speed
- Good manoeuvrability (roll+pitch) at high speed (max @ 600 km/h)
- High energy retention in level flight
- Decent climb rate, until 3,000 m
- Great RP and reward bonus due to premium status

'''Cons:'''

- Rather low ammo, with 125 RPG
- Loses a lot of energy in sustained turns
- Poor engine performance at alt > 4,000 m
- Engine overheats rather quickly
- Poor backward visibility in simulator mode due to cockpit design
- No G-Suit, can black out easily in high-speed manoeuvres

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
The North American P-51 Mustang was a single seat fighter which was designed, developed and entered service all during the course of the Second World War. The origins of the aircraft came about in April 1940, when the British Purchasing Commission approached the North American aviation company to design a fighter to augment those already in service with RAF Fighter Command. The prototype first flew on October 26th 1940 and, after a highly successful test and evaluation period, 320 aircraft were ordered and the first production aircraft flew on May 1st 1941. Delivered to No.26 Squadron at Gatwick, the new American fighter was designated the Mustang Mk.I by the RAF. It was considered to be superior to any other American fighter at the time, particularly at low level. However, the 1100 hp Allison V-1710 engine had a poorer performance at high altitude, particularly above 15,000 feet which was above where the engine supercharger was optimized for.

For this reason, the Mustangs were used in support of ground operations rather than in their intended original role as a fighter. The Mustang was very successful in this role and an additional order for a further 300 aircraft was placed. The new batch was modified by fitting self sealing fuel tanks and replacing the earlier Mustangs' eight machine guns with a new armament of four 20mm cannon, to create the Mustang Mk.IA. The RAF's successes with the Mustang led to a good deal of attention from the United States Army Air Force; after highlighting the fighter's only serious shortcoming as its high altitude performance, enquiries were made into fitting the aircraft with a different engine.

The British Rolls-Royce Merlin was selected for testing in five converted Mustangs, and the performance of the fighter increased dramatically. The airframe and wings were strengthened to harness the power of the Merlin engine, which also resulted in the fitting of under wing stores now being an option. Mustangs could now carry bombs, rockets or long range drop tanks. Now more than capable of competing across all altitude bands and boasting a particularly long range for a single engine fighter, the Mustang was rapidly evolving into one of the most capable air assets of the entire war. However, with British and American interest in the fighter still growing, future variants of the Mustang would show yet more improvements.

Generally regarded as the greatest American fighter of the Second World War, Mustang pilots were to claim nearly 5,000 air-to-air kills by the end of the conflict. The Mustang would go on to serve the USAF in the Korean War, and was exported to over 50 foreign air forces.
