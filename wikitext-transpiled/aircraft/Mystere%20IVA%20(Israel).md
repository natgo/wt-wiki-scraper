== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The first contact between Israel and the Mystere IVA came from an order for 24 units placed in 1955 and 12 were delivered on April of 1956, while the other 12 planes were sent April 23. Another 36 planes would be flown in Operation 'Shaharit'. Israel operated 61 Mystere IVAs in total. During the Suez Crisis, Israeli Mysteres flew 147 sorties, losing only 1 aircraft and claiming several Egyptian MiG-15s and de Havilland Vampires

Introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]], the Mystere IVA is a strong aircraft for dogfighting if it has enough energy. It deals excellent damage with its 2 x 30 mm DEFA cannons that can destroy aircraft in a few shots. As a dogfighter, it bleeds a lot of energy in manoeuvres at low speeds (less than 700 km/h). Pilots should prioritize staying at high speeds above 850 km/h in order to retain good fighting capabilities and have enough speed to dodge missiles if necessary. The lack of acceleration and cruise speed favours a passive styles over a more aggressive style.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Mystere IVA, while having decent top speed, suffers from a very poor cruising speed and acceleration. This means that it will be outran and outmanoeuvred by most aircraft of the same BR. However it has great energy retention at speeds over 850 km/h which means that staying at high energy states is more advantageous. Most loadouts wont affect the flight performance too much, except for the 500 kg bombs and the Mk.2 incendiary bombs.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Mystere IVA is a relatively large target, compared to other fighters from the same BR bracket. The fuel tanks occupy most of the aircraft, from the wing tips to the center of the aircraft. This layout makes fires easy to be start, so rounds (mainly incendiary) that won't destroy the airframe, could set it on fire with no problem.

Armour Layout:

* 2 x 16 mm steel plate [lower and upper back] of the pilot
* 16 mm steel plate in the lower front of the pilot
* 40 mm windshield in the front of the cockpit

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Pilots should prioritize the engine and other performance areas to combat the lack of power and only then go for ground ordnance.

Recommended modifications for Air RB in order:

# Fuselage Repair
# Compressor
# Engine
# Airframe
# Wings Repair
# Cover

After that, finish up the rest of the performance area and go for ground ordnance. If used in ground RB, go for the desired ground ordnance, belts first and then follow the modifications path mentioned earlier

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|DEFA 552 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm DEFA 552 cannons, chin-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)

The twin DEFA cannons are very effective against all sorts of targets, a few well placed shots of Air-Target belts would destroy an aircraft with no problem. While the ground target belts can deal with the roof armour of most medium and light targets that it would encounter.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
The Mystere IVA has a good amount of ground ordnance. The 4 x 500 kg bombs can destroy a full base and kill any ground target with a decent drop. The incendiary bombs work better against SPAA and also against full bases. The rockets offer the opportunity to destroy several ground targets of any kind if used with careful aim.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Arcade Battles'''

In AB, the Mystere IVA is very capable as a support fighter. The extra speed, climb rate, and acceleration compared to RB makes it so that it is capable of outrunning many of the planes that it face and also makes it more capable to participate in sustained fights where the energy would normally be a problem in RB and Sim. The gun radar helps with the aim at distances over 2 km, principally in head-ons where it helps giving a lead indicator to distances up to 3 km but is more inaccurate than the normal lead indicator present on arcade matches.

'''Realistic Battles'''

The Mystere IVA mostly relies on its teammates. The lack of engine power and poor energy retention makes it so that this plane is used better in a support role, picking enemies from the side of the map trying to flee to safety or killing enemies that are slow and vulnerable. It is outclassed by common threats like early MiG-21 variants, the early F-104s, the MiG-17/19 and the Lim-5P. Pilots should do their best job to keep their speed above 850 km/h and do very slight turns in order to not bleed that energy. Having an altitude advantage is also very rewarding, except in downtiers where interceptors such as the MiG-21s and F-104s can easily shoot down the Mystere IVA. In dogfights it can outmanoeuvre most jets as long as it has good energy, so sustained dogfights are not recommended.

'''Simulator Battles'''

Like many other planes from the same BR bracket, the Mystere IVA suffers from a lack of radar or missiles. This means that interceptors can easily catch you unnoticed and kill you with a missile. In SB, the Mystere IVA works better with a wingman to provide a couple of extra eyes to look in the sky. This can also be achieved in escort missions, providing valuable protection to bombers or attack aircraft like the A-4 Skyhawk. Flying low is also recommended to avoid radar detection and to use terrain as a cover against faster planes in evasive manoeuvres.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good energy retention at high speeds (850 km/h+)
* Excellent damage in the cannons
* Good amount of ammo for the cannons
* Excellent manoeuvrability at high speeds
* Good airbrakes and roll rate for making enemies overshoot

'''Cons:'''

* Poor manoeuvrability at low speeds
* Inadequate energy retention at speeds below 700 km/h
* Low muzzle velocity for the cannons
* Bad acceleration and cruise speed without upgrades
* Poor vertical performance and manoeuvrability

[[File:Mystere IVA.jpg|thumb|403x403px|Israeli Mystere IVA in display at the Hatzerim Israel Air Force museum]]
The Mystere IVA is a single seat fighter-bomber developed by France in the 1950s. The IAF operated a total of 61 units that were used in large scale combat during the Suez Crisis and the 1967 Six-Day War. The Mystere IVA was operated by the 101, 109, and 116 squadrons. While the Mystere IVA was intended to be replaced by the more modern A-4 Skyhawk, squadrons 109 and 116 still operated Mystere fighters at the start of the Six-Day War.

During the Suez Crisis, the Mysteres flew 147 total sorties and claimed several Egyptian aircraft. In the Sinai campaign, the 101 Squadron were used in recon and patrol missions to cover Israeli air operations. They were particularly useful during airborne operations, preventing the takeoff of enemy aircraft that may threaten the planes carrying paratroopers. The total score of the squadrons operating in the Sinai campaign was 7 enemy planes shot down, between MiG-15s, de Havilland Vampires and a single MiG-17. Only one Mystere IV would be lost, being shot down by ground-based AA fire.

These fighters played a significant role as ground attackers in the Six-Day War of 1967 and even claimed some air-to-air kills. Due to their ground attack role, 8 Mysteres would be lost due to AA fire. They were also used in raids deep in Egyptian territory, hindering enemy logistics and supporting ground units in combat. After the Six-Day War, the Mystere would be retired from frontline service and remained only as an advanced trainer aircraft for future pilots. The life of the Mystere in Israeli service ended in 1971 when they were fully retired from service.
