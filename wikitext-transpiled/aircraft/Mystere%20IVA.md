== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Red Skies"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|DEFA 552 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 30 mm DEFA 552 cannons, chin-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)

The guns, while deadly if they hit, have slow velocity, so it is important to get close to targets to ensure a hit. The armour-piercing shells are also very effective for taking out pillboxes, so while grinding out modifications keep in mind that extra points can be easily gained by shooting down a few light pillboxes. They can also penetrate the roof of most MBT's, so it is possible to destroy high level tanks in mixed battles when attacking from directly above purely with the guns.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|SAMP Type 21 (400 kg)|AN-M65A1 Fin M129 (1,000 lb)}}
{{main|AA-20 Nord|SNEB type 23|T10 151}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 2 x 400 kg SAMP Type 21 bombs (800 kg total)
- 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (1,000 lb total)
- 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 Fin M129 bombs (2,000 lb total)
- 38 x SNEB type 23 rockets
- 12 x T10 151 rockets
- 55 x SNEB type 23 rockets
- 93 x SNEB type 23 rockets
- 55 x SNEB type 23 rockets + 12 x T10 151 rockets
- 55 x SNEB type 23 rockets + 2 x 400 kg SAMP Type 21 bombs (800 kg total)
- 55 x SNEB type 23 rockets + 2 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (1,000 lb total)
- 55 x SNEB type 23 rockets + 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 Fin M129 bombs (2,000 lb total)
- 2 x AA-20 Nord missiles
- 2 x AA-20 Nord missiles + 55 x SNEB type 23 rockets

The Mystere has access to incredibly powerful rocket armaments. The heavy duty T10 151 rockets perform similarly to US HVARs, being rather slow, but deadly upon direct hit. They are very effective when attacking heavy tanks, as well as pillboxes, displaying 390 mm of penetration at a 30 degree angle. The other option is the high velocity SNEB type 23, which is effective for attacking medium tanks and MBT's, as well as light pillboxes. There is an option to have the SNEBs be mounted inside the fuselage, which will cause them to be launched 5 at a time just under the nose of the plane, for increased accuracy.

The AA.20 Nord air-to-air missiles are manually guided and not very agile, so they are best used against slow moving targets with a steady heading like Tu-4s. They are also very effective in head-on engagements with practice from the user.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

In air realistic battles, the Mystere is a very deadly aircraft in the hands of a good pilot.

Due to its very bad energy retention in manoeuvres, it is best used in more of a "boom and zoom" role, where it dives on unsuspecting enemies and delivers a quick death with the lethal 30 mm cannons. If forced to engage another aircraft that the Mystere is unable to escape, it performs best enacting a reversal, as the very good roll rate and poor energy retention will make it easy to make other aircraft overshoot. This is especially effective against MiG-15s and 17s, who will easily win a sustained turn-fight, but will have a hard time getting guns on target. Against more agile American aircraft, it is recommended to lure the plane as close as possible due to the poor speed. The majority of aircraft will easily be able to extend away after overshooting, so it is vital to equalize your energy states as much as possible, and be as close as possible for a firing solution once the enemy overshoots.

=== Radars ===
The M.D.454 IVa is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar located in the centre of the air intake in the nose of the aircraft. It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range in cockpit view.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- 30 mm DEFA 552 cannons are fast firing
- Able to execute very high G and angle-of-attack manoeuvres
- Excellent roll rate
- Good flaps
- Superb ground attack capabilities

'''Cons:'''

- Mediocre energy retention and sustained turn
- Bad acceleration
- Compresses at high speeds
- Slow muzzle velocity for the 30 mm DEFA 552 cannons

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Mystere IVA was used extensively by Israel throughout the late 50s, notably during the Suez Crisis of 1956. During combat missions there, the aircraft utilized superior performance to claim multiple MiG fighters, as well as a few de Havilland Vampires.
