== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a supersonic, 4th generation fighter aircraft, produced by General Dynamics. The F-16 was produced for the USAF as a part of the Lightweight Fighter Program, and notably the early blocks such as the Block 10 did not carry the [[AIM-7 Sparrow (Family)|AIM-7 Sparrow]]; this is carried over to the Netz in Israeli service. Israel is notably the second largest user of the F-16 after the USAF, and also achieved the first air to air kills with it.

It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]]. Compared to the [[F-16A ADF|Block 15]] and [[F-16A MLU (China)|Block 20]], the Netz is lighter and is able to pull an extra 1-2 Gs, making it one of the best dogfighters in the game. Compared to the [[F-16A|Block 10]] in the US tree it has a massive advantage, as it possesses the extremely potent [[Python 3]], one of if not the most potent heat-seeking missiles in-game. In exchange it loses the [[GBU-8 (2,000 lb)|GBU-8 "Hobo"]] for ground support. This leaves it as one of the best dogfighters in high tier battles, with reasonable multirole capability for CAS as well.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The F-16A Netz is very strong in a dogfight due to its excellent TWR and energy retention, its highly manoeuvrable and can easily reach its top speed even when climbing.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The F-16A Netz is not very armoured, so enemy aircraft can easily tear into your jet with some good timed shots. Its advised that you try to avoid being shot in the first place. The F-16A Netz has access to flares however so in the event of an enemy missile coming your way you'll be able to defend yourself, if not you can be lucky and survive some hits if the missile doesn't damage any vital components that are critical for your flight.

When played in ARB the Netz is a fast manurable and powerful jet, and one way to use it to all of these advantages to to become a ghost. With an air to air combat loadout - I recommend 2-9 Python 3s and the centre drop pod and 30 minutes of fuel - and turning off the radar immediately to  dictate the battle you first avoid the initial fight. Common maps encountered by the Netz is Golan Hights on the side of the lake, Afghanistan on the side of the enemy spawn being on the right side of the runway, and the new Chinese map mysterious valley on the side of ....... To play these maps with the Netz with this tactic is to stay out of sight, flying low in valleys, turning off afterburner to let enemies fly past you, taking a longer way around. By turning off you radar you become invisible to unaware jets because you don't ping on their warning system. Then when you can look around and see the majority of the enemy team engaged with friendly forces, turn however many degrees to then fly behind them. Its your choice from their, either wait for returning jets heading for the airfield ( They have often exhausted their missiles and countermeasures) or move up to surprise attack any who are locked in a dogfight. This method has led to many successful sneak attacks for me personally, and more than once I've accidently gotten within 3-2km without realising me the enemy are merging head on and gotten the kill with the amazing python 3s.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* High power-to-weight ratio gives it an incredible acceleration
* Highly manoeuvrable at lower speeds
* 20 mm Vulcan cannon has high velocity and rate of fire
* Able to carry a drop tank to extend flight time
* Has access to a wide range to air-to-ground loadouts
* Access to 6 x AIM-9L Sidewinder  or 6 x Python 3 missiles
* Python 3 missiles are very potent IR-guided missiles
* Bubble canopy with excellent unobstructed 360° visibility gives great situational awareness in simulator mode

'''Cons:'''

* Consumes fuel quickly
* No radar-guided AAMs
* The AGM 65 B does not have access to a thermal camera, which limits its use due to weather conditions

By the end of the 1970s, Israel had established itself as the dominant air force in the Levant, having achieved technological superiority over the Soviet-equipped Syrian army - the only adjacent threat remaining after the signing of the peace deal with Egypt. This was mainly thanks to the purchase of F-15s into the Israeli Air Force (IAF) in 1976, which provided both a defensive and offensive umbrella that could not be challenged effectively by the Syrians. Nevertheless, the IAF still had two critical issues with the F-15: its prohibitive cost, and its relative unsuitability for low-altitude bombing, interdiction, and dogfighting. As the pressure mounted to replace the ageing [[Kurnass|F-4E Phantom II]], [[Nesher]] and [[Kfir C.7]], the IAF finally decided to purchase General Dynamics's new F-16 multi-role jet.

Israel received its first four F-16s on July 2nd, 1980 - a mix of F-16A and F-16B fighters (single-seat and two-seat, respectively) - with a total of 75 arriving by the end of 1981. These planes, mostly F-16As from production Block 10, were originally sold to Iran's Shah regime, a US ally since the 1950s; however in 1979 the Islamic Revolution deposed the Shah, marking a significant change in the balance of power in the region and solidifying Israel's status as one of the only remaining trustworthy US allies in the Middle East. Since the planes could no longer be delivered to Iran, they were instead sold to Israel.

The IAF named the model "Netz" (Hawk), making no distinction between the F-16A and B. Due to its amazing capabilities as a low-altitude fighter-bomber, the Netz effectively replaced all other IAF combat jets except for the F-15. By the late 1980s, the F-15 and F-16 together comprised nearly the entirety of the IAF's active combat jet force.

On April 28th, 1981, less than a year after its introduction into the IAF, Netz #126 codenamed "Magen" (Shield) made the world's first aerial kill by an F-16 when it shot down a Syrian Mi-8 over the Bekaa Valley in Syria. Only a few months after that, on June 7th, 1981, eight Netz F-16A/Bs comprised the attacking element in Operation Opera - the Israeli surprise attack on the Osirak nuclear facility near Baghdad, Iraq - in which the reactor was completely destroyed. All attacking fighters returned to base unharmed. The fact that Israel had concealed its preparations from the United States caused President Reagan to withhold the transfer of the final two dozen F-16s to Israel, but this decision was rescinded after only a short while.

One year later, on June 6th, 1982, Israel began "Operation Peace for the Galilee", later known as the First Lebanon War. A few days into the war, on June 9th through June 11th, Israel conducted "Operation Mole Cricket 19", a massive SEAD campaign that obliterated the entire Syrian air defense network along the Syrian border with Lebanon. Dozens of Netz F-16s participated in this attack as interceptors, fighting alongside F-15s to shoot down any Syrian jets scrambled against the wild weasels. By the end of the second day of this operation, Israel's Netz F-16s alone had shot down a total of 44 Syrian [[MiG-21 (Family)|MiG-21]]s, [[MiG-23 (Family)|MiG-23]]s and [[Su-17/22 (Family)|Su-22s]] - more than half the total number of enemy jets shot down during the battle - while suffering no losses in the process. This massive, one-sided air battle has become known as the "Bekaa Valley Turkey Shoot".

One Netz in particular - Netz #107 codenamed "Sufa" (Storm) - distinguished itself in world history by becoming the jet with the highest number of aerial kills to this day. This F-16A was the second to bomb the Osirak reactor in 1981, and later shot down a total of 6 enemy aircraft (plus one "kill assist"), most of them during the Bekaa Valley Turkey Shoot. Four of these kills were scored by Col. Eytan Stibbe during a single sortie on June 11th - the only F-16 pilot in the world to ever achieve this feat. Stibbe later became Israel's second-ever astronaut - the first Israeli to visit the International Space Station. Today, Netz #107 is on display at the Israeli Air Force Museum. Israel's advanced F-16I model line is named Sufa in honour of this plane.

Israel did at one point attempt to produce its own 4th-generation multi-role fighter to replace the F-16: the IAI Lavi. However pressure from the United States forced the project to be scuttled before production could begin. In compensation for torpedoing the project, the US agreed to provide Israel with 75 F-16C/Ds (codenamed "Barak" in Israel), which were delivered in 1987. Nevertheless, F-16A/Bs remained in IAF service for many years afterwards. In 1994, the United States compensated Israel for staying out of the First Iraq War by supplying it with another 50 surplus F-16A/Bs, most of them from the US National Guard and Air Force Reserves. Most F-16A/Bs in the IAF were eventually upgraded to F-16C/D standards. All Netz F-16A/Bs were retired from IAF service by around 2015.
