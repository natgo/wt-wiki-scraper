== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a single-seat, carrier-borne biplane fighter of composite structure, this aircraft was created by Hawker Aircraft Ltd and based on the Hawker Fury land-based fighter. In early 1930, Hawker Aircraft Ltd built two prototypes, which initially had the unofficial name of "Norn", at their own expense. In early 1931, the first Hawker Nimrod prototype was sent on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle to Buenos Aires as part of the British Empire Trade Exhibition. By 1932, Nimrod Mk.I fighters began to replace the Fairey Flycatcher in Great Britain's Fleet Air Arm squadrons. The Nimrod's armament consisted of two synchronized 0.303 inch Vickers Mk.IV machine guns with 600 rounds each mounted on the forward fuselage. The aircraft was able to carry up to 80 lb (36 kg) of bombs on underwing hardpoints; usually this was made up of four 20 lb (9 kg) bombs.

It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. The Nimrod Mk I has inadequate speed, but makes up for it with an excellent climb rate that will get it above most other biplanes. It is also a highly manoeuvrable. Being slow makes it easy prey to faster fighters. Like [[Fury Mk I]], [[Fury Mk II]], and [[Nimrod Mk II]], the Nimrod Mk I is lacking in firepower, only armed with two [[Vickers E (7.7 mm)]] machine guns. Enemies to be aware of are aircraft like [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]] and [[Ki-10 (Family)|Ki-10]] which are able to out-turn the Nimrod and in the case of the I-15 being able to outgun it.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.7 mm Vickers E machine guns, nose-mounted (600 rpg = 1,200 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Nimrod Mk I has inadequate speed, but makes up for it with an excellent climb rate that will get it above most other biplanes. It is also a highly manoeuvrable. Being slow makes it easy prey to faster fighters, but that's where the manoeuvrability can come in play to avoid being a easy prey for superior fighters and make them bleed their energy.

Like [[Fury Mk I]], [[Fury Mk II]], and [[Nimrod Mk II]], the Nimrod Mk I is lacking in firepower, only armed with two [[Vickers E (7.7 mm)]] machine guns. Lacking in firepower doesn't mean it's useless, most aircraft at the battle rating are very lightly or not armoured at all which makes even the Vickers able to shoot down engaged aircraft with some ease, though not as efficient as [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]] with its four machine guns.

Enemies to be aware of are aircraft like [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]] and [[Ki-10 (Family)|Ki-10]] which are able to out-turn the Nimrod and in the case of the I-15 being able to outgun it. Another aircraft to be wary of is [[He 100 D-1]] being able to out-run and out-gun the Nimrod, it will mostly use its superior speed to make passes on the slower aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list.

* Highly manoeuvrable
* Efficient turn fighter
* Excellent climb rate
* Notable endurance

'''Cons:'''

* Insufficient firepower
* Inadequate speed

A single-seat, carrier-borne biplane fighter of composite structure, this aircraft was created by Hawker Aircraft Ltd and based on the Hawker Fury land-based fighter. In early 1930, Hawker Aircraft Ltd built two prototypes, which initially had the unofficial name of "Norn", at their own expense. In serial production, the aircraft came to be designated the Hawker Nimrod.

In early 1931, the first Hawker Nimrod prototype was sent on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle to Buenos Aires as part of the British Empire Trade Exhibition. The first production fighter's maiden flight took place on October 14th 1931. By 1932, Nimrod Mk.I fighters began to replace the Fairey Flycatcher in Great Britain's Fleet Air Arm squadrons, at this point still under the control of the Royal Air Force. The Nimrod first entered service with 408 Flight onboard HMS Glorious in November 1931, followed by 402, 404 and 409 Fleet Fighter Flights in 1932.

The aircraft was equipped with a 590 hp, liquid-cooled, Rolls-Royce Kestrel IIS engine.

The main external differences between it and the Hawker Fury were its strong landing gear legs with longer-stroke shock absorbers, its enlarged fin, increased wingspan and the extended area of its forward fuselage's metal skin. Flotation devices were fitted in the upper wing and the fuselage tail section to help the aircraft to remain afloat in the event of a forced landing on water. Stainless steel parts were incorporated in the wing and engine mount fittings to protect against corrosion. For carrier take off and landings, the cockpit was shifted forward slightly to improve visibility, although the first Nimrods to enter service were not equipped with an arrestor hook. Float-type landing gear could also be installed on the aircraft.

The Nimrod's armament consisted of two synchronized 0.303 inch Vickers Mk.IV machine guns with 600 rounds each mounted on the forward fuselage. The aircraft was able to carry up to 80 lb (36 kg) of bombs on underwing hardpoints; usually this was made up of four 20 lb (9 kg) bombs.

After the first Nimrods entered service, 19 of the fighters were equipped with arrester hooks, catapult fittings, and a pilot seat headrest fairing to ease catapult strain. Subsequently, some of these modifications were made to aircraft which had been produced earlier.

A total of 57 Hawker Nimrod Mk.I fighters were built.
