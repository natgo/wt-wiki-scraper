== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season III, "Strength athletics"]].

{{main|M4 (37 mm)|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 37 mm M4 cannon, nose-mounted (30 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (200 rpg = 400 total)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 1 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bomb (500 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The best way to play this aircraft is to exploit its respectable low-altitude performance and good turn rate. The engine will start to lose power above 4,000 m. It is best used performing Boom-and-Zoom tactics.

The plane has good energy retention and effective vertical combat capabilities. You can exploit this when you have to fight planes you can't outturn, for example Spitfires, A6Ms and other Japanese fighters. There will be some planes doing vertical manoeuvres better (J2M, Bf 109), but most likely you can easily beat these kind of enemies when it comes to horizontal dogfighting.

The dive speed is above average, so only use it to escape from light enemies (I-16s, Japanese turnfighters and Spitfires). Any other American plane can out-dive you.

The Airacobra's 37 mm M4 cannon in the nose will jam easily, so never spray or engage in long bursts. Also the M4 has a very low ammo count, together with a short effective range, a low velocity, and is horribly inaccurate. If you want to use the cannon against air targets, your best choice of belt would be the "Default" belt as it is entirely made of HEFI-T* shells, which can tear apart or set on fire any plane in just one hit.

The .50 cal machine guns coming with a sufficient ammo pool (but it can disappear quickly, so dont spray too much). They are getting mid-war belts, so its the best to equip the "Universal" belt as it contains a lot of M8 AP-I rounds. If you feel confident aiming the M2 Brownings, you should take the "Stealth" belt as it has the highest chance to set an enemy plane afire.

In summary, this plane is a solid opponent if used correctly. The plane is equipped to deal with almost enemy planes with its turn rate, its energy retention, its speed, its dive capabilities and its armament.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Deadly armament, 37 mm cannon can tear apart any air target with just one or two hits
* Backup machine guns are powerful and have a lot of ammunition
* Very good climb rate; capable of bomber hunting
* The pilot is relatively well protected
* Tricycle landing gear allows you to break continuously on the runway without danger of flipping over
* Great dive characteristics and very high rip speed

'''Cons:'''

* Catches fire easily, like all Airacobras
* The 37 mm cannon is inaccurate, has a very little ammo pool and rate of fire, suffering from low velocity and slow-travelling shells
* Turn radius is worse than the [[P-39N-0]], because of the additional weight and drag of the two extra .50 cals
* Poor high-altitude performance
