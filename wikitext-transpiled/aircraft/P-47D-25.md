== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

Like the [[P-51D-5|P-51D Mustang]], the P-47D-25 is one of the iconic fighters of the USAAF and also one of the most powerful. The wing of the British Spitfire melded with the iconic Pratt and Whitney R-2800 and bulky body, the P-47 is truly a force to be reckoned with, possessing very good performance, weaponry, and loadout. The ''"Jug"'' is thus one of the best [[:Category:Fighters|fighters]] in the USAAF line; possessing the hallmarks of a great fighter and the capability of a fast attacker.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

In Arcade battles, the P-47 can be pushed to its limits. Climb rate, turn rate, and responsiveness are all dramatically increased. Still, tactics used in RB also apply very well in Arcade- this fighter is great for practising Boom & Zoom in Arcade due to the impressive climb rate in this mode. However, the skill will not be built nearly as well in this mode, as rolling scissors and "skidding" manoeuvres will not really be needed.

Overall, the P-47 is a very pleasurable plane to fly for a quick jaunt in arcade battles.

;'''Realistic'''

The Thunderbolt was used as a high altitude bomber escort and excels at fighter roles in the game, but it can also be used as a very effective ground attack aircraft, thanks to its impressive bomb load. With the equivalent of 3,000 lbs of ordnance under its wings with munitions such as 1,000 lb bombs and 10 HVAR rockets, it is an excellent fighter-bomber. In this role, its performance is often superior to even dedicated ground attack aircraft such as IL-2 Sturmoviks. Its eight fifty-calibre guns are effective against soft targets which aren't worth rockets or bombs. With good aim, they can destroy light pillboxes when firing through the pillbox window on the sides, especially if using the "Ground targets" belt.

When using the "Jug" as a fighter, remember that speed is life, altitude is life insurance. Never give these up unless burning altitude is necessary to bait for a teammate / stay alive. Boom & Zoom tactics are a must in most scenarios, as the Jug cannot turn-fight most planes in the game. If the dive is unsuccessful, extend and regain situational awareness before making a second attempt. While the P-47 can attempt to energy trap enemy planes, its weak climb rate means it only gets one or two attempts before having to run away. Otherwise, it will stall in front of the enemy's guns. Good aim is a must, taking out the most dangerous threats first and leaving the weaker ones to be mopped up later by the P-47's massive ammo reserve.

As in real life, the performance advantage will shift in favour of the Jug above 3,000 m (Soviet opponents) or 6,000 m (most German and Japanese aircraft). The P-47 can become more aggressive at high altitudes, picking fights with formidable opponents such as the Bf 109 G-6.

Two missions present themselves: strike fighter (fighter-bomber), taken by going low with a full payload, ravaging the countryside, or as a fighter by climbing to the side of the battle and boom and zooming enemies that have dived into the initial furball. For the former, "ground targets" belt is advised, as it will easily pierce light pillboxes. For shooting down aircraft, pilots have the personal choice between universal, tracer or stealth depending on their playstyle. A gun convergence of at least 500 meters is recommended, as the P-47's long-ranged .50 cals have a better chance of scoring hits on far targets if the gun convergence is long.

The weakest aspect of the P-47 is not the plane, but the teams. It is not uncommon for most of the P-47's team to have been destroyed by the time it gets to altitude; in these scenarios it is important to keep a cool head and destroy the most dangerous threats first; either to the plane itself or to the tickets. Once this is accomplished, the Jug can handily clean up the dregs of the enemy team or win by ground-pounding.

On the other hand, if your team secures a numerical advantage it is wise to land on the airstrip,return to to the loadout menu by holding the "Leave the vehicle" button (Default key: "J") after completing the repair/rearm process, then load the ground attack ordnance. Remember to not bail out until fully repaired and rearmed!

;'''Simulator'''

In air Simulator, bulkier planes that suffer in AB & RB shine and that of course includes the P-47. Sitting at BR 3.7, the lowest BR for rank 3 EC, it can respawn infinitely without needing any spawn points which makes it a great learning platform for new EC players. In Sim, the P-47 has smooth handling, all-round unobstructed vision and fast speed, and it offers a wide range of additional loadouts like bombs and rockets, plus the original 8 x .50 cals with plenty of ammo each, meaning it is an excellent multi-role aircraft. It can perform ground pounding, bomber intercepting, traditional BnZ fighting, and, if there is an unfinished base, base bombing.

For attacking ground targets, choose wisely between the various payload options according to your target. Use the bombs and rockets to take out pillboxes and tanks, then the MG for soft targets like AAA, howitzers and trucks. When approaching the target, dive at a medium angle to gain speed and momentum for the bombs, try to drop as close as possible but avoid crashing into the ground. When the gunsight slices through and just above the target, drop the 1,000 lbs. When the target is at the center of the gunsight and fills up around 1/3 of it, release the 500 lbs. The eight MGs are perfect for destroying trucks, AA guns and artilleries as they have plenty of ammo. However, constantly watch your surrounding, especially your high 6 for any incoming enemies.

When intercepting a player-controlled bomber, it is always better to attack from a higher altitude. The more altitude you have over the target, the easier it is for you to lead which maximises your damage output. The American armament style of having numerous machine guns require the player to land plenty of hits on the target in order to cripple/destroy it, meaning that the player must control the lead well and maintain it throughout the pass, which is different and maybe harder than German/Russian armament styles, where a few hits from their large cannons get the job done. Luckily the P-47D is a very smooth gun platform at high speeds. Dive at the target from above with lead pursuit, and you can start firing once the target is about to fill up the reticle circle. Given the great velocity and trajectory of .50 cal bullets, this far distance can still cause damage to the target. Depending on your speed, you will have a ~3-5 second shooting window where the burst should last throughout. If your fire is accurate the target is very likely to get shredded to pieces, but if it is not, pull up for another pass. As you start to dive down again, the P-47 will wobble around a bit due to the low airspeed, so take your time to smooth down the plane. At an adequate speed of above ~420 km/h, the P-47's reticle can stay exactly where you aim at. Thanks to this firepower and stability the P-47D shines at dueling single targets.

However, for missions like "destroy enemy bombers" where there are around 10 AI bombers to destroy, the P-47 may struggle a bit due to its rather low one-second burst mass comparing to some dedicated heavy fighters/interceptors, and its big size. Once the player closes in on the AI formation it will immediately be targeted by countless gunners, and even with the Jug's ruggedness the skin will still get hit, causing aerodynamic efficiency loss. Plus its huge radial engine will usually get damaged. Amid the rain of bullets the player has to dodge some fire while also leading and firing long bursts, increasing the chance of getting hit. Though it is definitely possible to deal with such AI planes, there are still better candidates for this role. Heavy interceptor like the P-61 will make short work of any target with a short burst of its powerful cannons and can take more hits, while the P-47 must stay in the danger for longer to deal the same damage.

As for dogfighting, because most aerial battles in Sim occur at around 3,000 m, the P-47 can easily climb to this altitude and gather up lots of speed before engaging a battle. The tactic is similar to the RB one above. If, unfortunately, you find yourself being chased at your 6 and you don't know how to do any defensive manoeuvres, do a large, smooth turn towards the nearest friendly airfield to avoid bleeding too much speed. Then shallow-dive towards your airfield. The P-47 can quite easily outrun opponents like the A6M or Bf-109 E, but struggles to outrun Bf-109 F/G, FW-190 A or other P-47. Another way of disengaging is to do a sudden split-S to dodge under the chaser. Average Sim players will now try and see where you went, if not immediately losing track of you. You can then run for your airfield or shallow climb for another attack.

;Enemies worth noting (Sim)

- [[Me 264]]: This giant is one of the few bombers who get air spawns in Sim, so it usually flies higher than you think. On top of this, the Me 264 is armed with large calibre MG and cannons all over it, therefore tailing a 264 is basically suicide unless all of their gunners are knocked out. You can treat the 264 almost like a B-29 or B-17 as they are very similar in both design and defensive capabilities. It is best to head-on the 264 if you can as you can easily knock out the pilots due to its glazed nose while also taking minimal damage. However the bomber lacks a ventral turret on its belly, making it easy to deal damage from below, but be wary of the downwards facing rear 20 mm cannon near the tail. The safest way to attack is from a higher altitude, dive at an oblique angle and focus fire on the wings and nose. Never engage if you have no altitude advantage.
- [[Bf 110 (Family)|Bf 110]], [[Ki-45 (Family)|Ki-45]], [[A-26 (Family)|A-26]]: As mentioned before, those twin engine aircraft are a big threat since their lack of manoeuvrability comparing to single engine fighters are minimised in Sim. They are usually armed with heavy guns & cannons in the nose, so an accurate burst will tear any plane apart, including the P-47. The P-47 manoeuvres rather sluggishly and you might get out-turned from even those heavy fighters, so engage them with either altitude or speed advantage to avoid being targeted. If they are not manoeuvring aggressively, aim for their wings or engines. If the fight is intense and you cannot smooth the aim, just burst anywhere as long as you hit them, the 12.7 mm bullets will damage their flight models quite a bit.
- [[ZSD63]]: A dangerous SPAA to go up against in Tank Realistic Battles. Though it is hard to identify specific SPAA vehicles on the ground (especially when they are shooting tracers at the plane), if a ZSD63 is identified, avoid it at all costs and '''do not''' attempt head-ons with it, ever. It can easily snap a wing off by casually putting a short burst in the {{PAGENAME}}'s flight path. Don't even get close to it unless it is busy shooting someone else or if the {{PAGENAME}} has a bomb ready for use. Some identifying features of the ZSD63 is its rather boxy and tall hull with a geometric turret sitting at the back, slightly similar to a Wirbelwind's. The firing manner is also distinctive: the sound and green tracers are very rapid, much like a buzz saw, but then it will remain silent for half a minute reloading. Note that an experienced ZSD player will hold its fire or shoot in single salvos with long halts between, making it look like it's reloading. Armour-piercing belt is recommended since their high penetration can tear through the ZSD's armour with ease and knock out its crews.
- [[Yak-2 KABB]]: Do not think that the {{PAGENAME}} can confidently outmanoeuvre this plane just because it is twin-engined. The Yak-2 has an amazing turn rate for a heavy fighter, thus the {{PAGENAME}} must avoid turning with it, if not dogfighting with it in general. It bears a pair of ShVAK cannons that can easily damage vital parts like engine or cooling systems. It has green camo, greatly resembling an Me 410 but with an H-tail like a Bf 110's.

Developed by North Republic Aviation, the main role of the P-47 Thunderbolt was Bomber Escort, at high altitude the 'Jug' could contend with the latest from the Luftwaffe. The design was to also include much better protection for the pilot by having increased armour around the cockpit, however, this increased its weight substantially. It was the first American fighter to receive more than the standard 6 x .50 calibre M2 Browning Machine guns, a total of 8 all together, making it the most powerful Allied aircraft in terms of firepower at the time. Thanks to its rugged design, the Thunderbolt was able to take a considerable beating, more so than other allied aircraft, also with its sturdy airframe and reliable radial engine, the 'Jug' quickly took on the role of ground attack, able to arm itself with 2,500 lbs of bombs and rockets. All in all the Thunderbolt was one of the most successful allied aircraft during the war, even with the introduction of the faster and more nimble P-51 Mustang, later modifications of the Thunderbolt would go on to see action in the later part of the Pacific Campaign against the Imperial Japanese Navy.

A total of 385 D-25 models of the P-47 were constructed. This model was the first to receive the teardrop canopy. It was also fitted with an increased supply of oxygen and some systems were repositioned for higher fuel capacity.

The Republic P-47 Thunderbolt was an American fighter-bomber of the WWII era. It was one of the main USAAF fighters of WWII, especially effective as a fighter-bomber. The P-47 was also sent to the USSR via the lend-lease program. It was designed at Republic Aviation by two emigrants from the Russian Empire, Alexander Seversky and Alexander Kartveli.

The official designation of the P-47, like that of many other Republic aircraft, is related to the word Thunder. However, the P-47's unmatched dimensions and weight led to the P-47 being nicknamed the Jug. Another informal nickname, more common during WWII, is Bolt or T-Bolt. The most mass-produced variant of the P-47 was the P-47D with a teardrop canopy. The variant was in development as early as 1941 and the first order for 850 P-47Ds was placed in late 1941. Many more Thunderbolts would be built during the war, making it the most mass-produced US fighter of WWII by 1945.
