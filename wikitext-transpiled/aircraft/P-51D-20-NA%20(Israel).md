== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Great top speed at any altitude
- Outstanding Boom-and-Zoom capability
- Excellent high-speed manoeuvrability
- Respectable armament with plenty of ammunition
- Large variety of payload options
- Good cockpit visibility, good for SB
- Generous fuel load for long-distance flights

'''Cons:'''

- Generally sluggish at low speeds
- Average climb rate
- Large minimum fuel load compared to other fighters which can cause fuel tanks to burn for longer
- Somewhat fragile aviation components

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In the summer of 1948, Israeli agents looking to acquire aircraft for the newly founded Israeli Air Forces smuggled four P-51s into Israel to bypass the United States Arms Embargo, in crates labelled "Agricultural Equipment". The first two, No. 190 and 191, arrived in September of 1948, entering Israel's first fighter squadron. They served in Herzliya and Castina (Hazor) during the War of Independence in 1948. The planes dominated the skies, due to its long range that could reach across the entire Middle East, as well as better performance than the aircraft of the Arab side.

The first shootdown by a P-51 was on November 20th, 1948, when an RAF Mosquito was shot down during a mission to collect intelligence on Israel. The first combat was against Egyptian [[C. 205 serie 3|C. 205]]s on January 5th, 1949. On the last day of fighting, two days later, the two P-51s encountered six Egyptian C. 205s while on an escort mission, and shot three down.

The P-51s were used as the primary fighter of the IAF, performing bomber escorts, ground attacks, and maritime patrol. However, in the early 1950s, the IAF started to arm itself with jets such as the [[Meteor F.8 (Israel)|Meteor]], [[M.D.450B Ouragan (Israel)|Ouragan]], and [[Mystere IVA (Israel)|Mystere]]. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, the P-51 was brought back into action due to the international circumstances. IAF command refused to let the P-51s fly before achieving air superiority, only being active by the end of the war.

Due to the proliferation of jet fighters, as well as advancements made in anti-aircraft weaponry, the P-51 was retired on January 15th, 1961. It served the historical purpose of using multi-role fighters of both ground attack and interception roles to maximize capabilities with a limited fighter arm.
