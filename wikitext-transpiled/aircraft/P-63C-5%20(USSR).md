== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. It was a reward vehicle for the [[wt:en/news/3489--en|2016 "Winter Holiday"]] event.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

[[File:P-63C-5 USSR.png|thumb|Armour layout of the P-63C-5 (USSR)]]

- 12.7 mm Steel plate - behind the propeller
- 15.87 mm Steel plates - in front of the pilot's feet
- 19.05 mm Steel plate - behind the instrument panel
- 19.05 mm (63°) Steel plate - between the instrument panel and the windshield
- 38 mm (61°) Bulletproof glass - Windshield in front of pilot
- 12.7 mm Steel plate - behind the pilot
- 12.7 mm Steel plate - behind the engine

The pilot is protected from the front, having 3 armour plates covering the front of the plane. Because of the engine being in the back, it is more protected compared to more conventional engine setups.

{{main|M10 (37 mm)|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 1 x 37 mm M10 cannon, nose-mounted (58 rpg)
- 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (250 rpg = 500 total)
- 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (200 rpg = 400 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|FAB-250sv (250 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 3 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (750 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".''

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

Bell P-63C-1/C-5 Kingcobra Army Fighter

The most advanced production model of the P-63. The P-63C had a more powerful engine, the Allison V-1710-117 (1500 hp), as well as a short-term water injection afterburner capable of boosting the engine to 1800 hp. The airplane's aerodynamics were changed: an additional fin was added under the fuselage. Other external differences included a carburetor intake and new truncated wings. The area of the stabilizers, however, was increased. Measures taken to eliminate the danger of the plane falling into a flat spin were not entirely effective; however, the plane did spin less dangerously than the P-39 Airacobra, without jerking and twisting the controls around. The plane's armament remained the same as on the A-9 and the A-10.

The P-63C fighter was produced in two major series. The C-1 series featured a multipurpose ventral pylon under the plane, similar to that of the A-1 and A-5 series, which could carry an extra fuel tank or a bomb. 215 of these airplanes were built.

The C-5 featured two additional pylons under the wings, similar to those of the A-6. So, the P-63C-5 could carry three 500-lb (227-kg) bombs or three extra 75-gallon (284-liter) fuel tanks, or a combination of the two.

The number of pylons was the only difference between the two series. The P-63C-5 became the largest series in the Kingcobra's production. By May of 1945, 1,012 planes had been constructed.

The Red Army Air Force's opinion of the P-63 was positive. Pilots noted the plane's high speed, good maneuverability, and powerful armament. The convenient three-wheeled chassis, coupled with efficient brakes, provided good conditions for taxiing, takeoff, and landing, and the plane's handling on the ground was excellent.

In World War II, the P-63 would only see combat in the USSR. In the short military campaign in the Far East in August 1945, the Japanese air force provided no serious resistance, so evaluating the Kingcobra's combat performance in air-to-air combat was not possible.

In all, 3,303 P-63 aircraft were produced, including all modifications. After the war, they remained in service with the Soviet Air Force until 1952-1953. In the U.S., all of the planes were officially retired in 1946.
