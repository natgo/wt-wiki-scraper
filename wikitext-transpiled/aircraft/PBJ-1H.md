== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.41]].

The PBJ-1H is U.S. Navy variant of the [[B-25J-20|B-25]] which was operated by the U.S. Marine Corps as a ground attacker. This aircraft is a powerful ground strafing machine and due to the weapons package built-in, it can be viewed as a gunship. With eight 12.7 mm machine guns and a 75 mm cannon, most light ground targets such as AAA positions and Artillery positions can be destroyed. The 75 mm T13E1 cannon is similar to the 75 mm M3 on the Sherman tank and shares its powerful support capability. With Armoured Targets belt loaded, it can knock out light pillboxes with ease and greater accuracy than bombs in Realistic and Simulator modes. It is even effective against light and medium tanks, although the low fire rate makes it less than ideal for strafing several targets in a short target window. It is recommended to use the virtual cockpit view to aim the main gun. The 12.7 mm guns should be mainly utilized against "soft" targets such as armoured Cars, AA and artillery positions, and the 75 mm Gun against hardened targets such as light pillboxes and tanks. That said, the concentrated MG fire can also be used to destroy light pillboxes (with practice), though will require significant ammo usage to do so.

Despite armament differences, the airframe of the PBJ is still that of the B-25. While this means that it will have a relatively large number of defensive weapons, it also means that it is relatively sluggish compared to other close-support aircraft. It also presents a relatively large and slow-moving, though semi-well-defended target. Beware all variants of the Bell [[P-39 (Family)|P-39]] Airacobra, [[P-63 (Family)|P-63]] Kingcobra, [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]] Thunderbolt, all variants of the [[Me 410 (Family)|Me 410]] and the [[Yak-9T]]; these aircraft can destroy your aircraft without much difficulty, whereas you will have a difficult time expending numerous 12.7 mm rounds trying to knock them out of the sky or off your tail.

This aircraft has several weaknesses in which the pilot must be aware of which could be exploited by attacking aircraft. First, the twin rudders in the tail section create gunner dead zones. The rudders will prevent the side gunners and to an extent the dorsal gunner from firing on an enemy attacking from the shadow of either of these two spots. The tail gunner should be able to neutralize this weakness as long as he has not been knocked out. The underside of the aircraft is especially vulnerable as there is no ventral turret and the tail gunner, side gunners only have a limited downward angle in which they can shoot, so it may be best to fly as low as possible in certain circumstances. Even with the great fire-power utilized on this aircraft, the pilot's best bet will be to operate under fighter cover when possible.

Other differences from the B-25 are the smaller bomb payload, attacker spawn location (lower altitude than bombers) and the lack of a bomb-sight view for precision bombing.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm Steel - Lower nose armour plate
* 8 mm Steel - Pilot and Co-pilot's seats
* 9.5 mm Steel - Fore cockpit armour plate
* 9.5 mm Steel - Side armour cockpit plates
* 9.5 mm Steel - Cockpit rear plate
* 9.5 mm Steel - Dorsal gunner aft plate
* 6.35 mm Steel - Side gunners armour plate x 2
* 9.5 mm Steel - Tail gunner protective armour plate
* 12 mm Bulletproof glass - Dorsal gunner turret
* 38 mm Bulletproof glass - Tail gunner canopy

Rugged, sturdy, though, the PBJ-1H is all of those things. Featuring crew armour protection that outclasses the [[B-17G-60-VE|B-17 ''Flying Fortress'']] in a handier, smaller design, the PBJ-1 is a tough nut to crack and even harder to devoid of the crew. Calibres above 20 mm are a must for a quick kill, otherwise, the PBJ-1H will repay in kind. Forgoing all defence is good, but all offence, too? It is called overkill, of the pursuit fighter.

The two Wright R-2600 air-cooled radial engines are themself hard to destroy and with dropped payload, the PBJ will just keep flying on a single damaged one. Denying under armed fighters the ability to lethally cripple it. Yet this aircraft has got one downside: Fuel tanks. While present in all planes, the armour, crew and bomb bay take up all the fuselage. Leaving only space in the wings. A common cause of the crash is hence a fire and thus a structural failure of the wing spar.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The best way to destroy tanks with the 75 mm cannon is to use first-person pilot view which reduces parallax because you are closer to the level of the cannon, allowing for the crosshairs to be more accurate. The shells will almost always penetrate an enemy vehicle, so shoot at the points where the crew is in mixed battles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Immense firepower in the form of eight 12.7 mm machine guns and a 75 mm cannon in the nose
* Excellent defensive firepower, utilizing most of the B-25's gun positions
* Durable airframe which can withstand numerous hits before going down
* Tricycle landing gear makes takeoff and landing easier
* 75 mm AP-T shells have 50 g of explosive filler, so side-shots into vehicles are mostly one-shot eliminations

'''Cons:'''

* 75 mm cannon fires so slow that it is usually impossible to destroy more than 2 tanks when passing over a convoy
* Recoil from 75 mm cannon will literally yank the entire plane's nose off-target
* Default belt for 75mm cannon alternates between HE and APT shells, giving mixed results
* Payload is limited compared to B-25 Mitchell and configured as a dive bomber rather than a level bomber
* Performance is sluggish at best
* Twin tails create a blind spot for gunners, a trait carried by the B-25 family

== History ==

The US Navy and Marine Corps received large numbers of B-25 Mitchell bombers from the USAAF after a mid-1942 deal between the two services. A total of 248 PBJ-1H bombers were acquired by the Navy and Marine Corps.

The PBJ-1H was a navalized variant of the B-25H Mitchell bomber. Marine Corps PBJ-1H bombers were heavily modified, with an AN/APS-3 search radar in a radome on the starboard wingtip, an AN/APN-4 Loran receiver, APK-2 IFF, AN/APN-1 altimeter, SCR-522A VHF radio, ARN-8 marker beacon, C-1 automatic pilot, ATC radio transmitter, ARB receiver, YC-2B receiver, BC-348 liaison receiver, and the AN/APG-13A "Falcon" 75mm radar gun director.

The PBJ-1H was manned by a crew of seven. There was the pilot, co-pilot, navigator, two radio-gunners, a mechanic-turret gunner, and an armorer-turret gunner. The armament consisted of eight forward-firing .50 cal machine guns, and six turret and waist .50 cal machine guns, for a total of 14 .50 cal machine guns.

The Marine Corps used PBJ Mitchells as land-based bombers. By the end of 1943, the Marine Corps was operating PBJs in eight squadrons, with four more squadrons being formed (these squadrons were not operational by the end of the war). These squadrons of PBJs were first operationally deployed in 1944, and they were mainly used to interdict enemy shipping while operating out of the Philippines, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa towards the end of the war.
