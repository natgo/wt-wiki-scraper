== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]].  Overshadowed by the better known [[PBY-5 (Family)|PBY]], the Mariner was still a key part of Americas control of the oceans.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The PBM-1 does not shine in flight performance as it has terrible climb rate and speed. This along with the low wing-loading makes it your average medium bomber without the perks of being able to outrun or out-climb your opponent.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
A robust aircraft and able to take more damage than others of size, compensating for lack of armor and slower speed.  It also has .50 cal defensive machine guns covering nearly all angles, best angle is on beam where 3 of the mg's can converge. If one cannot fly above enemy fighters, then fly just above the ground where defensive gunners can engage.  A well-timed bomb could also take down a pursuing enemy. It also has advantages in its natural element, naval battles!

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
Bomb racks are the priority unlock for this unit, only pick a speed mod if needed to unlock to lower ranks.  After that get the Ammo, Wing, and Engine; the rest is your discretion.
== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M30A1 (100 lb)|AN-M57 (250 lb)|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)}}
It all about big bombs, and lots of them.  The 4 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs is ideal, but in some missions carrying 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs + 4 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (also 4,000 lb total) can work better.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 12 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs (1,200 lb total)
* 6 x 250 lb AN-M57 bombs (1,500 lb total)
* 6 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (3,000 lb total)
* 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs + 4 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (4,000 lb total)
* 4 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (4,000 lb total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, nose turret (400 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, dorsal turret (400 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (375 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, tail turret (350 rpg)

All the guns cover the upper hemisphere of the PBM, best to fly on deck when enemy is near.  The M2 Browning machine gun is potent at this battle rating, so you have a good chance of shooting down an aircraft.  Remember to select the API-T belt.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The PBM-1 should be played like its predecessors. Fly high and bomb bases. The PBM is however fairly slow and has a rather bad climb rate, so it will take time. The PBM can carry up to 4 x 1,000 lb bombs. It is advisable to carry this bombload for bombing bases. Even though you are slow, you are not defenseless. Your .50s will shred everything at your BR. Once your bombs are dropped it is advisable to land, but acting as a "gunship" can also be somewhat successful.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Quite manoeuvrable for a bomber (can outturn many heavy fighters, and some single-engine fighters)
* Can carry a large payload for its BR (4,000 lbs)
* If aimed properly, and using the right belts, defensive armament is very deadly
* Defensive armament has great coverage
* Using WEP doesn't make engines overheat
* Large fuselage with lots of non-critical empty space can absorb lots of bullets 
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (4 in lower fuselage, 1 in each wingroot)

'''Cons:'''

* No armour
* Gunners can easily be taken out, especially the tail gunner (no armour, and no bulletproof glass either)
* Lacks a belly turret (due to being a boat) and therefore vulnerable to attacks directly from below
* Very slow aircraft with a poor climb rate
* Very bright peace-time paint scheme.


== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
During the 1930s the United States had a vibrant seaplane making industry making ever larger flying boat category of seaplanes. Sikorsky, Boeing, Grumman, Consolidated (of [[PBY-5 (Family)|PBY]] fame), and Martin all vied for the lucrative opportunities of an aircraft that could land almost anywhere on earth with little investment in facilities. Advances in technology lead the US Navy created a few new “system designation” in 1935, with “PB” for “Patrol Bomber” being one of them. Glenn L. Martin company leveraged its considerable flying boat and bomber aircraft experience to design a new aircraft for the requirements of long range with considerable offensive ability and bomb load. In many ways similar to the PBY, it was superior in having internal bomb bay, providing a performance advantage when fully loaded (commonly posted stats often do not list fully loaded performance). It was also larger, more complex, and 50% heavier.

After testing with a 3/8 scale flying model (Martin 162A Tadpole Clipper), the XPBM-1 prototype first flew in 18 February 1939 proving a solid design, except for stability issue with the horizontal stabilizer and twin tails. To solve this the production PBM-1's horizontal stabilizer was given a dihedral to match the wing but maintained the 90 degree angle to the vertical stabilizer, resulting in an inward cant of the vertical/rudder tail (unlike nearly any other aircraft, like the Be-6). Like the PBY the wing floats retracted, but not to the tips but instead into the wing (like the [[BV 238]]). Defensive armament was 5 turrets, nose, dorsal, tail, and both waists in unique round windows, each a single .50 cal machine gun, considered very powerful in 1939. The doors under the nacelle and inner wing look like they are for landing gear, but are instead for the internal bomb bay! Able to carry a sizable bombload without the performance drag penalty of external mounts, the PBM-1 had a notable performance advantage over the PBY. Not immediately visible is the triangular shaped doors under the nose, which opened for the bomb sight station. There was also an adapter to carry two torpedoes just below the nacelle (similar to the Martin produced [[B-26B|B-26]]).

Although a sound design, only twenty one of the "-1" was built before the improved "-3" was put into production. Those 21 where heavily used in patrolling coastal North America, at first doing “neutrality patrols” hunting for enemy submarines and raiders in territorial waters and shadow allied convoys. PBM was also the first US Navy aircraft to be equipped with British made AVS surface search radar to improve its mission. Demand for this aircraft was destined to increase.
