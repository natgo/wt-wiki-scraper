== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XVI, "Skilled Marksman"]].

Note that equipping [[Mk.13-6 (2,216 lb)|Mk.13-6 torpedoes]] will block landing gear, and needs to be deployed or jettisoned in order to allow the landing gear to unfold.

=== Defensive armament ===

{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, nose turret (400 rpg = 800 total)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, dorsal turret (600 rpg = 1,200 total)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, tail turret (1,000 rpg = 2,000 total)
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (420 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Can land on either land or water

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks a belly turret (due to being a boat) and therefore vulnerable to attacks directly from below
* Very slow aircraft with a poor climb rate

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In 1944, the final version of the Mariner, the PBM-5, entered service. This model included upgraded radios, turrets, and radar, in addition to new R-2800 engines that were more reliable than the troublesome R-2600s installed on the PBM-3. One of the most innovative features of this version was the provision for Jet Assisted Takeoff (JATO) bottles. These were ideal for making short takeoffs in the heavy Pacific sea conditions frequently encountered on "Dumbo" rescue missions flown for B-29 crews that had to bail out or ditch.

As the submarine threat diminished towards the end of the war, PBMs operated in other combat roles, such as the "Nightmare" raids conducted against Japanese shipping under cover of darkness. Mariners also bombed shore installations on a number of Pacific islands, in addition to targets on mainland Japan. PBMs also claimed a number of Japanese fighters shot down in self-defense.

The Mariner continued in post-war use, and supported the early atomic bomb tests in the Pacific and mapped Antarctica under the command of Admiral Byrd. The PBM's lack of landing gear became a liability, because it could not operate from the well-equipped air bases that had become common in the areas served by the type. As a solution, the Navy ordered Martin to construct 36 PBM-5A amphibious models with retractable tricycle landing gear. A further four switched to this configuration from standard PBM-5s. The new models entered service in 1948, and 1949. Eventually, most became transports and had their turrets faired over. The Mariners swan song occurred during the Korean War, when they performed essential nighttime patrols along the Korean coastline with high-powered searchlights. In 1952, the superb Martin P5M-1 Marlin began to roll off the assembly line, and quickly rendered the Mariner obsolete. The last PBM in operational service retired from the Coast Guard in 1958.

Only one of the 1,366 Mariners constructed survives intact to the present-day.
