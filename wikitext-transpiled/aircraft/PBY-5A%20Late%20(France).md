== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} French bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Much like the American, British and Soviet PBYs that came before, the PBY-5A (Late) features surprisingly good survivability, owing to the large empty spaces in the hull and armour plates behind the pilots, allowing it to soak up lots of LMG and even some weaker HMG fire. The Wing-mounted fuel tanks are a weak spot, as a number of good incendiaries in them will send you on a trip to the ground in flames.

* 9.5 mm steel plates behind pilots and in front of nose gunner
* 6.35 mm armour behind tail gunner
* 6.35 mm and 4.7 mm steel plates in wing pylon

* 16 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs (1,600 lb total)
* 4 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (2,000 lb total)

{{Navigation-End}}

The PBY-5A features a massive payload: a whopping 4 x Type A Mark I mines (that function on the ground like 2,000 lb bombs). The French PBY-5A features custom payloads, meaning that you can generate your own larger (or smaller) payloads for certain scenarios (e.g. in AB, loading the maximum payload of 4 x Type A Mark Is + 12 x 100 lb bombs, although whether or not they are worth the effort is up to you, as they will slow down the already slow PBY).

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)|Browning (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:
* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (478 rpg)
* 2 x 7.62 mm Browning machine guns, nose turret (1,050 rpg = 2,100 total)
* 1 x 7.62 mm Browning machine gun, ventral turret (500 rpg)

The armament in the PBY-5A (Late) is a significant step up. For starters, the nose gun has been switched out for a twin .30 cal turret, making the frontal arc much more well-defended. The biggest difference, however, is that the two beam turret .50 cals are now provided with late-war turret belts, which means access to the infamous M20 API-T rounds. Use of the Universal belts provides an API/I/API/API-T combination, making the turrets even more capable of shredding the biplanes and early monoplanes found at 1.7. Use manual control when enemies get up close, as you can bag a surprising number of air kills this way, even allowing you to act as an ad-hoc bomber hunter by flying alongside enemy bombers and using the .50 cals to spray them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Although the PBY-5A technically is a medium bomber, it is best to fly high, as flying low will make you an easy target for fighters and AA. The best tactic for fending off enemy fighters is to use the rudders to direct one of the side gunners towards the attacking plane. It is also smart to use the guns manually in this situation, as the AI is often very inaccurate and will refuse to fire beyond a certain distance. In the worst case scenarios, a dive can be used to greatly increase the plane's speed to get to attack a ground target before a pursuing enemy fighter shoots it down.

The plane is quite unmanageable, and its wings are very weak, being able to snap just by turning just a little too tight at higher speeds in realistic battles. It's also a huge target. Although the PBY-5A Catalina is slow and clunky, it offers a heavy payload that is sure to be a game changer if used properly. 

The armament on the PBY-5 Catalina is what makes up for its clunky movement. The plane is capable of carrying a heavy payload of bombs or torpedoes and has defensive gunners on all sides. The two side gunners have .50 cal machine guns, making it more than capable of destroying enemy aircraft that stay within their range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good payload
* Good rear defensive armament with a high coverage angle
* Durable
* Can capture points in naval battles

'''Cons:'''

* Very bad at climbing
* Slow top speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
