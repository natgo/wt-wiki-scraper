== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
'''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]] and was part of the [[wt:en/news/5225-special-french-vehicles-as-christmas-presents-en|2017 "Christmas presents"]] giveaway. It is also the starting premium vehicle of french air tech tree

The plane is modelled after one used by French pilot Gabriel Pallier. The Dewoitine D.510 is an open cockpit monoplane equipped with one Hispano-Suiza H.S.404 cannon and two MAC 1934 7.5 mm machine guns. The aircraft has no specific defects, but no notable advantages either. Its engine is extremely prone to catching fire (especially when hit by weapons of 12.7 mm calibre)

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

Pallier's D.510 has a 3 mm steel plate in front of the pilot. The fuel tanks are not self-sealing. There is one located underneath the pilot's feet, and one in each inner wing.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

'''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, nose-mounted (60 rpg)
* 2 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, wing-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

The two machine guns are arranged with one mounted on the underside of each wing. Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire with each other until empty.  The 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon is mounted in the nose and fires out of the propeller hub.

'''Belts'''

'''For the machine guns:'''

Default(T/B/B/B/I/AP): Not that bad, but not that great, it can be used as multirole if you don't have the modification. I you have the multirole one, use that instead

Multirole(T/AP/AP/I/I): It's really good in ground RB where you don't know if you will fight against planes or ground vehicles.

With indicator(I-T): It's your main weapon against planes, and it does the job well.

Without indicator(AP/AP/I): It's okay against ground targets , but it's not a big problem because the cannon does most of the job anyways.

'''For the cannon:'''

Default(HEI/HEI/P/T): It's really good for a starting ammo but I recommend switching to something else if you can.

Multirole(HEI/SAP-I/AP/T): It does it's job as a multirole ammunition really great, it is a go to choice in ground RB.

Against ground targets(AP/AP/AP/HEI/I): It's great against ground targets, it pens most enemies that you ecounter in that rank with its 27mm pen from 100m , at an angle of 30.

With indicator(AP/HEI/T): It's like a multirole but without SAP-I, does it's job in ground RB and against planes too.

Without indicator(HEI/HEI/SAP-I/AP): It's brutal against bomber and other  lightly armed targets, I recommend using that belt.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The extremely limited 20 mm ammo supply should be guarded carefully and used only for heavier and larger targets where the destructive power of the HEF shells can make quick work of enemies. Most other fighters of the period will fall quickly enough to the 7.5 mm MAC rounds.

Like most other low-tier fighters, the D.510 is exceptionally agile, able to turn well inside aircraft even a single BR higher. Combined with the powerful 20 mm Hispano cannon, the D.510 can be a serious threat to aircraft well above its normal rank.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 20 mm cannon is devastating for fragile planes at low BR
* Nose-centred guns are easy to aim in Simulator
* Pretty agile, can sometimes turnfight biplanes
* Considerably fast for a vehicle in its tier
* Great over-the-nose visibility, allowing easy aiming in a Simulator dogfight
* Easy to control at low speeds, meaning forgiving landing characteristics for Realistic/Simulator
* Open cockpit allows player to hear outside sounds easily, which is beneficial in noticing nearby enemies
* Excellent for dogfighting
* Fixed landing gear makes landings easier
* Has WEP, unlike the D.501, which can last for almost forever with MEC

'''Cons:'''

* Low cannon ammo count of only 60 rounds is very unfriendly to pilots with poor aim
* Weak armour. No rear protection at all for the pilot. Open cockpit is also vulnerable to pilot sniping
* Thanks to the previous 2 points, not very beginner-friendly
* No flaps, limiting its turning potential
* Fixed landing gear creates more drag

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
