The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet dive bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The Pe-2 fulfils much the same attack craft role as the [[IL-2 (1941)|IL-2]]. While the guns are 7.62 mm machine guns and therefore worse than the IL-2's, it can carry much heavier bombs, allowing it to destroy targets in one hit that an IL-2 might take two or three bombs to destroy. Additionally, its nose-mounted weaponry and the fact that it spawns at bomber altitude on most maps make it a surprisingly effective hit & run bomber. However, as with other attack craft, you should have a friendly cover you whenever possible. While it has defensive guns and is faster than the Sturmovik, it is still very vulnerable when caught alone. Additionally, it is very vulnerable to diving attacks due to its dorsal-mounted fuel tank.

There are disadvantages as well. The fixed armament is inadequate at best: two nose-mounted machine guns simply lack the punch of cannons and their low ammunition supply prevents prolonged usage. The defensive armament is not any better – the upper and lower hemisphere of the aircraft are each defended only by a single 7.62 mm machine gun, with the ventral turret having an extremely limited field of view and the side mounts being largely redundant. Your best defence is then the Pe-2's agility and speed. When attacked by enemy fighters, use your speed to run away and your agility to dodge gun passes until you have reached friendly fighters or strong allied AAA.

Fast, agile and very versatile, the Peshka can be a great bomber if used correctly and its niche lays in tank battles, as a precise dive bomber. Further research of this line will then lead you to even faster and better-armed variants, notably equipped with 128 mm rockets, excellent for attacking tanks and the occasional bomber.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Pe-2 is a relatively fast aircraft for a plane of its BR. It has a decent climb and roll rate, but performance is significantly worse at high altitude. The turn rate isn't the best, even for a bomber of its size, and it bleeds quite a bit of speed when turning. It has decent responsiveness, even with the 1,000 kg load. It has poor low-speed performance and compresses easily (around 500 km/h). However, the Pe-2 has a fairly effective set of airbrakes mounted under the wing. It is recommended to be at around 300 km/h; even though this seems relatively high, the airbrakes and landing flaps slow the Pe-2 down quickly.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm Steel plate behind the pilot

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

* The first rank of upgrades do not matter much, just choose either two out of three to unlock research for rank II.
* When possible, choose ''DZ-40'' first to unlock more payload variants. Afterwards, the only thing to worry about is performance. Acceleration takes a hit with the newer heavier payloads.

* 1 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun, ventral turret (750 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
[[File:Cockpit_Pe-2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cockpit with translated gauges.]]
The Pe-2-1 Peshka's firepower is rather meagre, only really meant to scare off the enemies with the right angle. The 7.62 mm calibre weapons won't be destroying enemy aircraft with a quick burst. The defensive turrets are also armed with the same 7.62 mm weapons which are also poor in both firepower and protection. The turret firing arcs are small (Dorsal: 80° horizontal, +5 - +60° vertical; Ventral: 80° horizontal, -10 - -20° vertical) and open hatches mean that there are blind spots and the gunners could be quickly dispatched by a strafing aircraft. As such, it's not wise to spawn in the Pe-2 if you don't have friendly fighters up.
[[File:BomberImage_Pe-2X-ray.jpg|thumbnail|X-Ray view of the Peshka's modules. Note the very big fuel tanks placed all over the plane.]]
The Pe-2 is capable in Air RB as well as Ground RB due to its varied payload options. For air battles, any load will be effective (albeit the unlockable ones take a big toll on climb rate, acceleration and speed). The 6 x 100 kg option will still be a good choice for a quick and speedy mission. In ground battles, the 2 x 250 kg + 4 x 100 kg option and the 2 x 500 kg option are the best; it is recommended to use the 500 kg option if you are not as comfortable with bombs. These bombs do not drop in pairs.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Nose mounted weaponry
* Versatile bomb load for an attack craft
* Rather manoeuvrable for a twin-engine attack craft
* One of the faster twin-engine dive/light bombers
* All metal construction results in a sturdy airframe. Can handle up to 800 km/h dives
* Can develop huge speed advantage over the competition by trading altitude for speed (this bomber is one of the better rush bombers)

'''Cons:'''

* Large target
* 7.62 mm insufficient for any ground target, except trucks
* Large fuel tank in the midsection makes it vulnerable to fires
* Armour does not protect back gunner and pilot is only protected from the back
* Poor field of view of the back gunners. 7.62 mm is not only insufficient for self-defence but often cannot even get a proper aim if an attacker is careful

[[File:Petlyakov Pe-2 Peshka (14467132393).jpg|thumbnail|Two Peshkas flying in formation. Likely to be two more out of the picture and therefore part of a flight of Pe-2s.]]
Originally, the Petlyakov Pe-2 was not supposed to be a bomber at all. Its direct predecessor, designated VI-100, was designed by a prison design bureau team led by Vladimir Petlyakov as a high-altitude escort fighter. The VI-100 was very modern for its time, featuring a pressurized two-seat cockpit, electrically actuated systems and all-metal construction, and was powered by two supercharged Klimov M-105 V-12 inline engines producing 1,100 horsepower each. The prototype was completed in 1939 and during its first test flight on 7th May 1939, it reached a top speed of 630 km/h (390 mph) – an astounding performance for its time.  The results of flight tests were so promising that the VI-100 was ordered into production.

However, Germany launched the "Blitzkrieg" campaign in September 1939. Aside from their revolutionary usage of tanks, the campaign in Poland featured notable usage of Ju 87 dive bombers and showed their potential. Consequently, the Soviet authorities ordered the VI-100 to be redesigned as a dive bomber. Pressurisation equipment and engine superchargers were removed, dive brakes were installed under the wings and the bombardier position was added to the nose of the aircraft(raising the number of crew members to three). A ventral bomb bay was added along with the two smaller bomb positions located at the rear of engine nacelles.  Two rear-facing turrets, each armed by a single ShKAS machine gun, were installed to dorsal and ventral positions. The resulting aircraft, able to carry up to 1,600 kg (3,520 lbs) of bombs, was designated PB-100. The first prototype flew on 15th December 1940 and its performance (top speed of 540 km/h (335 mph)) was so good that Vladimir Petlyakov was released and the aircraft was named after him, thus receiving the designation Petlyakov Pe-2. The bomber was then rushed into serial production and deliveries to combat units began in the spring of 1941. The deliveries were, however, slow and by the time of the German invasion in June 1941, only about 458 Pe-2's were delivered.

The Pe-2, nicknamed Peshka ("Pawn") by its crews, quickly proved itself to be an effective dive bomber and together with the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik attacker, it became the most important offensive weapon of the Soviet Army Air Force. The bomber was fast and agile enough to be an elusive target for German fighters and also proved its versatility – it was used for reconnaissance and artillery spotting and also became the basis for the [[Pe-3bis|Pe-3]] heavy fighter. Losses were heavy, however. Crews often complained about a lack of armour protection for the cockpit and fuel tanks as well as poor defensive armament and unreliable dive brakes, which sometimes failed to retract and allowed top speeds of only around 300 km/h (186.4 mph), making the fast bomber easy prey.

A twin-engine, all-metal monoplane with a twin-fin tail and a retractable landing gear system with tail wheel.

The idea to create the Pe-2 front line dive bomber was born quite suddenly. The experiences of World War II, which had just recently started, showed that the concept of heavy twin-engine fighters was defective. The planes either failed miserably or had to play a different role in the conflict. The Petlyakov VI-100 high-altitude fighter created in OKB-29 of the NKVD's Special Technical Bureau was no exception. Despite its impressive test results, with characteristics significantly exceeding those of its European counterparts, and despite the fact that industrial facilities were prepared for mass production, it was decided that the aircraft should not begin production, for it was clear that such planes were simply not needed. At the same time, the Air Forces of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army clearly required that the fleet of front line bomber aircraft be upgraded and replenished. Dive bombers in particular had made a good showing in the first years of World War II, but planes of this type were absent in the USSR's forces. It was decided to make up this deficiency by converting the VI-100 fighter. In principle, this design was quite promising, and the industry was ready for mass production. In addition, there was no time to develop a completely new design. As a result, Petlyakov was ordered to prepare in the shortest possible time a PB-100 dive bomber based on the existing fighter prototype.

Only one month and a half were given to perform the redesign, but the designers pulled it off brilliantly. In the autumn of 1940, the PB-100 successfully passed all tests and was immediately launched into full-scale production. In 1940, the aircraft was re-designated the Pe-2, after the last name of designer V. M. Petlyakov. The first series were few in number: usually 5 to 10 planes, and 20 at most. This was done specifically to allow for improvements during production.

The first production planes were equipped with 1,100 hp Klimov M-105R twelve-cylinder V-type geared water-cooled engines.

The plane's defensive armament consisted of four 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns. Two ShKAS machine guns with 500 rounds each were fixed in the forward fuselage, and the navigator could fire from the TSS-1 turret (with a magazine capacity of 750 rounds) mounted behind the pilot. The LU-MV-2 hatch mount with 750 rounds was located in the lower fuselage.

The standard payload of the Pe-2 was 600 kg, and the maximum was 1,000 kg. Four bombs with a maximum weight of 100 kg were housed in the fuselage bomb bay, and one more bomb was placed in each of the two bomb bays located in the nacelle rear section. Bombs of larger weights, such as 250 kg and 500 kg, could be accommodated only on external bomb racks under the center wing section.
