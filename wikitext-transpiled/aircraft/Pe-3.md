== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->Given that it was derived from a twin-engine dive bomber, the Pe-3's flight performance is very lacklustre. The one advantage of the Pe-3 is that it is relatively fast, capable of reaching 500 km/h in level flight and 600 km/h in a dive. However, its climb rate and acceleration are both poor due to a lack of engine power. The aircraft's turn rate is also quite mediocre even for a twin engine heavy fighter, though it is superior to aircraft such as the [[Do 217 J-1|Do 217 J]]. The Pe-3's control surfaces are relatively responsive, though elevator and aileron compression starts to occur past 500 km/h. Unlike the [[Pe-2-1|Pe-2]], the Pe-3 does not have dive brakes.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}<!-- Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems. -->
The Pe-3 is actually quite survivable, given its larger size and spaced-out components. The aircraft's fuel tanks are located the wings and behind the cockpit, and are all self-sealing and feature an inert gas pressurisation system to prevent fires. As a result, the aircraft can sometimes survive fuel tank fires, though this should not be relied upon. Additionally, compared to its dive bomber sibling, the Pe-3 gets armour around the cockpit: 45 mm of bulletproof glass in front of the cockpit, 13 mm of steel on the pilot's seat and 6-12 mm of steel around the dorsal gunner's station.

However, the aircraft's engines and oil tanks are exposed and unarmoured, meaning that they are vulnerable to damage. Given that the aircraft is underpowered to begin with, the loss of an engine may prevent the aircraft from making it back to base.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}If you intend on playing the Pe-3 as a ground attacker, the DZ-40 and RO-132 modifications should be your first priority in order to unlock the Pe-3's suspended armament options. If not, starting with offensive 12 mm belts is a good idea to unlock more effective ammunition. After that, focus on flight performance upgrades, particularly the engine upgrades, to improve climb rate and handling.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine guns, nose-mounted (250 rpg = 500 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FAB-100sv (100 kg)|FAB-250sv (250 kg)|RS-132|RBS-132}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (200 kg total)
* 4 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (400 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs + 2 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (700 kg total)
* 6 x RS-132 rockets
* 6 x RBS-132 rockets

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun, dorsal turret (750 rpg)
* 1 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun, tail turret (250 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great armament
* Air spawn in realistic and simulator battles
* Carries rockets, fantastic for ground striking and bomber hunting
* Good roll rate for a larger aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* Bad top speed for a twin-engine fighter
* Bad acceleration
* Bad turn rate
* Lack of defensive armament
* Severe control stiffening above 600 km/h IAS

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

;Petlyakov Pe-3 Heavy Twin-Engine Fighter

When the Great Patriotic War began in the summer of 1941, the Air Force of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army urgently needed a patrol/interceptor aircraft to fight the enemy's bombers and scouts. But with a war in progress, troops could only quickly receive a twin-engined fighter if it were based on some plane currently in production. The older Pe-2's fighter design fit this need perfectly.

In August 1941, the Petlyakov Design Bureau was instructed to design a fighter version of the Pe-2. The first prototype Pe-3 fighter, redesigned from the production Pe-2 bomber, series 16, flew for the first time on August 7, 1941. Only seven days passed between the order for the aircraft and its delivery for trials!

Structurally, the Pe-3 fighter differed from the Pe-2 in the layout of its forward and middle fuselage and its armament. Additional fuel tanks were put in the plane's fuselage, with one located in the bomb bay and two others replacing the gunner's cockpit. The plane was modified to be a two-seater.

The fighter had increased offensive armament. The nose weapon mount of the prototype Pe-3 model consisted of two 12.7 mm Berezin BK machine guns with 150 rounds each and one 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun with 450 rounds. The TSS-1 upper mount in the navigator's cockpit consisting of a 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun with 750 rounds was kept unchanged from the Pe-2. Since there was no one to provide fire from the lower rear of the aircraft, a fixed tail mount with a 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun with 250 rounds, which had been tested before on the VI-100 high-altitude fighter, was installed.

The plane's bombing armament was drastically simplified. Only four bomb racks remained from the Pe-2: two in the engine nacelle bomb bays and two (external) under the fuselage. The total bomb capacity was reduced to 400 kg for standard load and 700 kg (two 250 kg bombs and two 100 kg bombs) when overloaded. The brake covers under the wings were removed together with the gears, and, as a result, the ability to perform dive bombing was gone.

Production Pe-3s had the ShKAS nose machine gun removed, but the magazine capacity of the BK machine guns was increased up to 250 rounds each.

During armament testing of the nose mount, it was found that the Plexiglas fuselage nose section could not withstand the muzzle gas pressure, resulting in its destruction. Plexiglas was first replaced with duralumin and then with steel. The aircraft glazing was reduced when large observation blisters and the upper glass hatch of the gunner's cockpit were removed.

The heavy fighters were delivered from the factory to the front lines with equipment corresponding to the main production Pe-3 aircraft. The total number of Pe-3s built in 1941 was 196; 11 more planes were assembled from available stocks of parts in April 1942.
