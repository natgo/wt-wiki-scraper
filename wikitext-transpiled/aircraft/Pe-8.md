== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.53 "Firestorm"]].

The Petlyakov {{PAGENAME}} was an early design Soviet heavy bomber which debuted in 1936. This monster of a bomber was the only four-engine bomber produced by the Soviet Union during World War II. Though impressive as it was, it was only produced in limited numbers and was reserved for special occasions called "morale raids" to encourage and raise the spirits of the Soviet population by hitting important German targets deep behind enemy lines to include bombing Berlin in mid-1941. Other prime targets included the nighttime bombing of factories, German airfields and rail yards. As such an important aircraft to the Soviet people, it became a priority target for the German Luftwaffe pilots to go after. By 1944 all remaining {{PAGENAME}}s were removed from service but were retrofitted for other jobs such as VIP transport and operations up into the arctic circle.

The {{PAGENAME}} though a large and tempting target, it is not without its merits. The huge bomber has a nose gunner, tail gunner, rear-facing dorsal turret and two rear-facing underwing gun pods. Attacking this aircraft especially from the rear whether above, below or directly from the rear is a bad choice as, like with the [[BV 238]], there are many defensive guns which can hit and hit hard. These defensive weapons are critical to protecting the bomber against inbound enemy fighter especially because of the bomb payload which it can carry. Options can range between 2,000 and 5,000 kg bomb loads with as many as 40 x 50 kg or 100 kg bombs, or fewer but heavier bombs such as 6 x 500 kg bombs or a single massive 5,000 kg FAB-5000 bomb.

It is easy to see why the {{PAGENAME}} would be a prime target to eliminate as if left unchecked, it could easily wipe out the enemy bases without flinching and move onto the next. Other payload options are useful for carpet bombing areas where clusters of lighter vehicles or fixed anti-aircraft targets may sit. Fleet vessels are not to discount this bomber as it has the means to destroy ships with its accurate bomb sight, pending the pilot slowing the aircraft down enough to let the bombardier line up the target and release the necessary ordnance. For the pilot of the {{PAGENAME}}, fly high and drop as much as you can on the targets, as a fighter trying to take out the {{PAGENAME}} set up your run so that in the event you lose control of your aircraft, it has a good chance of ramming the bomber causing it to crash as this aircraft has a good propensity to soak up bullets.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Pe-8 has poor flight characteristics: the plane is very heavy for its engines and thus is slow. This limits its top speed as well as its climb rate. The wings being massive, the turn radius is large and the bomber's manoeuvrability is mediocre. Combined with a short tail, this creates instability and causes the Pe-8 to wobble when changing directions. The bomber usually compresses and wobbles after doing sharp turns, which can be very lethal at low altitude. It can take the pilot a certain time to regain control of the bomber. When engaged in a steep dive, the same phenomenon (compressing and wobbling) takes place, restricting it only to a level bombing role.

Note for new Pe-8 pilots - Since this plane's control surfaces are huge and rotate very slowly, they will have lots of inertia: after you release a keyboard button for rolling, the ailerons will keep deflecting for a second or two before stopping, which is unlike the controls of smaller aircraft where the control surfaces stop deflecting immediately as soon as you release the button. Therefore it is a good practice to release the button a second before the Pe-8 is at an optimal position, as the control surfaces' inertia will do the job after letting go the keyboard input.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The Pe-8 has a durable airframe, meaning the bomber can take some damage, still complete its mission and make it home. Even if its fuel tanks are self-sealing, fires tend to be devastating for the structural integrity of the wings.

;Armour plates

- 8 mm Steel - Plate behind pilot's seat
- 8 mm Steel - Plate behind copilot's seat
- 8 mm Steel - Plate for underwing nacelle gunners x 2
- No armour glazing

;Critical components

- The pilot and the controls are located in front of the aircraft
- Engines and fuel tanks located throughout the wings
- Fuel tanks are self-sealing

[[File:Pe-8 *jermster 91 001.jpg|450px|thumb|right|]]
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|FAB-50sv (50 kg)|FAB-100sv (100 kg)|FAB-250sv (250 kg)|FAB-500sv (500 kg)|FAB-1000 (1,000 kg)}}
{{main|FAB-5000 (5,000 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 40 x 50 kg FAB-50sv bombs (2,000 kg total)
- 40 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (4,000 kg total)
- 12 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (3,000 kg total)
- 6 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (3,000 kg total)
- 4 x 1,000 kg FAB-1000 bombs (4,000 kg total)
- 1 x 5,000 kg FAB-5000 bomb (5,000 kg total)

The Pe-8 can carry the FAB-5000 bomb, the largest bomb in-game, with over 5 tons of TNT equivalent, which proves extremely deadly in ground RB and naval battles. The 40 x 100 kg bombs loadout is suitable for carpet bombing against columns of vehicles and occasionally base bombing while the 4 x 1000 kg bombs loadout is best suited for destroying bases and airfields, and 2 bombs are required to destroy a base. The stock payload of 40 x 50 kg bombs has very little efficiency against ground targets due to lack of explosive power and is ill-suited for base bombing.

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}

<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|ShVAK (20 mm)|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 1 x 20 mm ShVAK cannon, dorsal turret (200 rpg)
- 1 x 20 mm ShVAK cannon, tail turret (230 rpg)
- 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, 2 x engine nacelle turrets (200 rpg)
- 2 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, nose turret (750 rpg = 1,500 total)

The rear-facing 20 mm ShVAK cannon turrets are quite accurate and easy to aim, they will deal with any enemy fighter daring to come close. The 12.7 mm Berezin MGs in the engine nacelle turrets provide extra coverage from behind. While the defensive armament can be powerful, it is still ridden with weaknesses: the turrets lack any kind of armour, so your gunners can be knocked out easily and each turret has a low ammo count, resulting in frequent reloads that essentially leave you defenceless. The frontal 7.62 mm ShKAS MGs lack power to deal with fighters flying towards the Pe-8 head-on. Aircraft coming from high altitude can also avoid defensive firepower by exploiting their dead angles.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:Pe-8 the interceptor 002.jpg|450px|thumb|right|]]

The Pe-8, as mentioned earlier, is in essence a Soviet Death Star (a.k.a Tu-4 at a lower tier). It both boasts a very effective cannon armament and a high bomb load, able to kill two bases in one pass. Its 5,000 kg bomb is especially useful in Ground Battles as a "tactical nuke" of sorts, able to wipe out large concentrations of enemy tanks.

However, the FAB-5000's practicality ends there. In Air Battles, the FAB-5000 is woefully overpowered against most targets and makes it inferior to most of the plane's other bomb loadout combinations. In addition, it peculiarly does less damage against an airfield than the 4 x 1,000 kg payload, further decreasing its usefulness. Instead, use the other payloads. The stock payload of 40 x 100 kg bombs, while difficult to aim, can still be used to base bomb, simply drop 12 on a base to destroy it (remember that the first 16 are pylon mounted meaning they drop in pairs, so the first base will require only 6 presses of the bomb release button). Keep using this payload for base bombing until you unlock the 4 x 1,000 kg modification, as all the other payloads yield less damage. You can use your bombs to destroy ground targets as well, however, be sure to be high enough or use a timer so that the bomb's splash damage doesn't kill you.

Try to side climb around the main battle when going after bases, though your defensive armament is powerful, you will be an easy target for experienced players, heavy fighters, and groups of fighters that encounter you. If you see an enemy, always turn the plane to make sure the rear cannon-armed guns face the pursuer so you can focus as much of your defensive firepower on them as possible while also increasing the time you can put your guns on the target. Make sure to fire in bursts as your guns will jam if fired for too long.

===Ground RB===
In Ground Realistic mode, the Pe-8 can be used as a CAS aircraft to a devastating effect. If there are no fighter aircraft or few SPAA, try to find the largest group of enemies and drop the FAB-5000 as fast as you can. This usually results in 1-2 kills, but can easily net many more. Try to spawn early game, as there will be less fighter aircraft and SPAA. Let it be noted that there is a certain terror from seeing a FAB-5000 slam into the ground next to your tank that is not easily replicated elsewhere in War Thunder.

===Naval Battles===
In Naval Battles, the Pe-8's FAB-5000 is capable of destroying any ship. Due to its huge explosive mass, the FAB-5000 is able to create a massive shockwave from underwater explosion that can cause an ammunition detonation to nearby ships (~ 50 m from explosion radius), this means it does not require a direct hit to deal a crippling blow to the enemy.

However, delivering the FAB-5000 to the targets can be a bit tricky as anti-aircraft fire in Naval battles is much more accurate, hard-hitting, and plentiful. One would try to compensate for this by flying high up, but you will find that it is hard to aim the FAB-5000 from these altitudes. Thus, it is more effective to bring the Pe-8 to higher-tier battles with less manoeuvrable, usually slower ships.

To drop the bomb accurately, start by set the bomb fuse to 1 second to ensure that the enemy will not get away from the explosion radius, then fly up to an altitude of at least 1,800 m to avoid most of short range AA barrages (around 2,500-3,000 m is a suitable altitude for accurate and relatively safe drop), select an isolated or a slow target which has a few escorts, then approach them. Make sure to watch the long range flak barrages while flying to ensure that they will not hit you, while getting close. Take a look at the water trail left behind the target to get an idea of their trajectory and speed. Then aim the bomb sight, make a compensation and drop the bomb. You can use the bomb tracking camera to see where the bomb dropped and adjust your aim for the next drop in case the shockwave wasn't able to kill the target.

====Counter-tactics====

<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->

When pursuing the Pe-8, try to go for a head-on - nearly all the time there is critical damage and "pilot snipes" to down the aircraft - with the added bonus that the front is the least defended area of the Pe-8. Use your mobility to do so. When in a not so optimal position, try to come up at a angle above the Pe-8 - with a sharp enough angle, you will stop the 12.7 mm MGs from reaching you, and with a bit of luck, you will make it past the single 20 defending the plane.
