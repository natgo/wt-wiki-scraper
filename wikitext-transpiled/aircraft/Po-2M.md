== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (or Po-2P) was a proposed Soviet biplane intended to be used as a floatplane version of the [[Po-2]]. It was developed in the 1940s and was successfully tested at the Khimki water reservoir near Moscow. Due to the requirement to mount a bomb load beneath the lower wings, it was created using a single-float scheme. Apart from that, there were only a few minor differences between it and the land-based version, such as the addition of a spinner to the propeller, hiding the rudder control cables in the fuselage, and a trimming glacis to the elevator. Despite positive test results, it was never put into production. It's very likely that biplane designs were simply considered out of favour at the time, and thus the aircraft never stood a chance.

The {{Specs|name}} was introduced during [[Update "Drone Age"]] as a reward for the 2022 [[wt:en/news/7882-event-project-overpowered-en|Project "Overpowered"]] event. It essentially plays the same as the Po-2 but with some minor improvements. Unfortunately, its status as the slowest plane in the game remains unchanged, but its payload options remain impressive. In comparison to the Po-2, it trades two 50 kg bombs for the ability to carry four more rockets of each type, and even incendiary bombs. The defensive machine gun was also changed to a [[DA (7.62 mm)|7.62 mm DA]].

== History ==
Early work on the U-2M, or Po-2M happened at Factory No 25 in Moscow under the supervision of Sergey Kocherigin. The Po-2M, at the time was designated MU-2 or U-2M, had one central floats, and 2 smaller secondary floats for lateral stability.

Tests of the Po-2M were conducted on the Moscow river in spring of 1931, where it was found the main disadvantage of the Po-2M was starting the engine. It was extremely uncomfortable to start the engine manually, because there was no other way of starting the engine at the time, while standing on one side of the floats. After the appearance of the Sh-2 flying boat, the USSR didn't have need for any more floatplanes. So the conversion of the U-2 ([[Po-2]]) into a floatplane was temporarily stopped.

The conversion continued nine years later, with the appearance of a more powerful M-11D engine with 127 HP and featured a pneumatic self-starter. At the same time, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute conducted an extensive investigation into floats for aircraft of different gross weights, speeds and roles. For the U-2, they selected the Model 10 twin float design, as they were intended to have a high lift-drag ratio at low speeds.

The single-float Po-2M that we know and love was made at factory No 51 under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, while the dual float U-2M was made at factory No 23. Based on his wartime experience, Polikarpov decided to make a special-purpose combat aircraft to carry out military operations in area's that have lakes and rivers. So that the new float aircraft could put bombs under the wings, he chose a single float design with two secondary floats. Armament included 2 [[FAB-100sv (100 kg)|100 kg FAB-100sv]] bombs, 4 [[FAB-50sv (50 kg)|50 kg FAB-50sv]] bombs, 4 [[ZAB-50FP_incendiary|ZAB-50FP]] bombs, 8 rockets ([[ROS-132]], [[RBS-82]], and [[ROS-82]]), and a single rear-mounted [[DA (7.62 mm)|7.62 mm DA]] machine gun. A new NP-Po-2 Night bombing sight was used as well.
