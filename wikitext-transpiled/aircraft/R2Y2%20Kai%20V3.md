== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].

Even though the R2Y2s are able to equip 800 kg bombs, they wield a powerful set of 4 x 30 mm Type 5 cannons, mounted in the nose. This aircraft trio is similar to the Me 262 series as they all lack an engine or propeller in the front of the plane. Thus, the R2Y2 and its German counterpart wield an impressive set of cannons. However, unlike the legendary slow-firing, low muzzle velocity Mk-108s in the 262, the R2Y2 series wields Type 5 cannons with a much larger ammunition pool. Although their rates of fire are comparable, this fact of a higher ammunition count allows the R2Y2 to be able to destroy large amounts of aircraft without having to return to base. In arcade battles, having a large ammunition pool is also useful as it will often be unnecessary to reload.

The R2Y2 series of aircraft features a devastating battery of weapons mounted centrally within the nose. Much like the [[Me 262 (Family)|Me 262]], the lack of a piston engine mounted within the nose allows for much larger cannons to be placed within the space it would have occupied. 4 x 30 mm [[Type 5 navy (30 mm)|Type 5]] cannons with a ammo load of 600 rounds (150 rounds per gun) means the R2Y2 is effective at almost any role you chose to play it as. Attacker or interceptor, the R2Y2 is an effective multi-role aircraft for the Japanese at era V.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.''

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The R2Y2's biggest downfall is its speed. Start by unlocking the performance modules first, as they will increase survivability more so than any armament upgrades. Being able to use the "Stealth" belt for the 30 mm cannons is a huge advantage over Tracer and Universal, provided you can aim, as the Tracer shells halve the HE fillers.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Type 5 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 30 mm Type 5 cannons, nose-mounted (150 rpg = 600 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 (800 kg)|Navy Type 99 Number 80 AP (800 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 1 x 800 kg Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 bomb (800 kg total)
* 1 x 800 kg Navy Type 99 Number 80 AP bomb (800 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The R2Y2 is best utilized as a medium-altitude fighter in all game modes. Due to its lacklustre acceleration, gaining airspeed as early as possible is crucial. Once the R2Y2 loses speed, it's an easy prey for fast-accelerating planes like the [[F7F-1|F7F]]. It is important to always have a high speed when attacking enemies as they will often be able to slot in on your tail in a matter of seconds. This short time can be a matter of life or death as many fast-turning propeller aircraft such as the Spitfire wield impressive armaments with high burst masses. However, these advantages can be nullified once the R2Y2 pilot has the ability to dive away at high speeds.

If tailed, it can often be difficult to evade enemies with this aircraft, jet engines or not. Many propeller planes like the [[Tempest Mk II|Tempest]] can easily stay with a diving R2Y2. If found in this situation, the R2Y2 pilot has a few choices. One, the best method is to call for teammate assistance. Not only can one keep the enemy greedy and focused on his or her tail, but this pilot can also "set up" that enemy for a teammate to destroy. If found alone, it can be possible to catch propeller planes in a "speed trap" where once you start to outrun the enemy you pitch up to gain altitude. Once the enemy prop stalls out, dive on them. If the first pass doesn't result in a massive fuel fire and explosion, set up the same approach as before. Even if the propeller plane has the ability to outmanoeuvre the R2Y2, it is still very daunting to have to dodge an aircraft armed with four 30 mm cannons.

However, the R2Y2 has a trick up its sleeve. It can turn incredibly well for a jet, and retains manoeuvrability at all speeds. Use this advantage to turnfight your opponents if they are jets! If that isn't your style, you don't need to worry. The R2Y2 has a great set of 30 mm cannons, along with plenty of ammunition. Its almost impossible to run out when played the right way!

The R2Y2 can also be beneficial to any Japanese or arcade battles team as a ground attacker. Its 30 mm Type 5 cannons have the ability to equip armour-piercing rounds which are capable of destroying light tanks, medium tanks, and light pillboxes, among other targets. This coupled with the single 800 kg bomb can cause some serious damage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Better performance than the [[R2Y2 Kai V1|V1]] and [[R2Y2 Kai V2|V2]]
* 4 x 30 mm Type 5 cannons mounted in the nose with a very generous ammo count of 600 rounds
* Very manoeuvrable for an early jet
* Frequently faces prop aircraft and early jets
* Clear cockpit with good all-round vision (excellent for SB pilots in particular)
* Often fights prop aircraft in simulator battle

'''Cons:'''

* Poor acceleration (although it is decent at low speed)
* No armour protection whatsoever on the aircraft
* Limited bomb selection for an Attacker/Jet Bomber
* Easy target
* Sometimes difficult to line up guns
* Poor rate of roll
* The plane becomes nearly useless if the engines get hit
* The rudder is like a big airbrake, slows the plane down; neglect it
* The 30 mm Type 5  cannons may deal underwhelming damage for their calibre

The single-seat land-based Kugisho R2Y2 Keiun-Kai or "Beautiful Cloud" was a planned jet-powered Reconnaissance Bomber/Attacker based on the two-seat R2Y1 Keiun. The R2Y2 would feature an armament of 4 x 30 mm Type 5 cannons and an external bomb load of up to 800 kg. The powerplant of the jet Keiun-Kai would be a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines mounted in pods located, with one under each wing. Later versions (V2 and V3) would feature the engines mounted centrally within the fuselage.

The Y-40 project began with failure of the Kugisho R1Y1 (Y-30) project for a fast, high-speed reconnaissance aircraft. The development of that project, along with inspiration from the German Heinkel He 119, the R2Y (Y-40) project was developed. Initially intended as a fast reconnaissance aircraft with a long-range that could be operated from land bases across the Japanese Empire, that would avoid interception with high-speed flight, however, Kugisho also informed the IJN that the aircraft could be adapted to other roles. They proposed that the planned Aichi Ha-70 engine powerplant of the R2Y1 could be replaced by a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines. Nonetheless, work on the R2Y1 continued, however, it proved troublesome due to the Aichi powerplant. By April 1945 the first prototype of the Keiun was ready for initial trials, with the first flight in early May of the same year. The R2Y1 suffered engine-cooling issues during its early development, and fire occurred during ground-testing that would damage the aircraft and its powerplant.

This would not be the only disaster of the project, as the first prototype was completely destroyed by a bombing raid, further damaging the R2Y's chances of ever becoming an operational aircraft. The second R2Y1 prototype was still under construction at the time of the Japanese surrender on August 15th and the R2Y2 remained on the drawing board.
[[File:FighterImage_R2Y2V3.jpg|thumbnail|right|The nose intake and higher tail-plane configuration of the V3 clearly visible here]]

===V3 Variant===
The most advanced proposed design of the R2Y1 redesign, the V3 features a major deviation compared to the last two that makes it stand out from the other proposed designs. The V3 uses a nose intake rather than the ones featured within the wing roots on the [[R2Y2 Kai V2|V2]] or the wing-mounted pods of the [[R2Y2 Kai V1|V1]]. The nose intake being quite a radical step away from what was common on jets of the era and something that is more reminiscent of the [[F-86 Sabre (Family)|F-86 Sabre]] or [[MiG-15]]. As well as this, the V3's tail-plane is also mounted slightly higher to achieve more of a "T" shape profile by comparison to the other 2 proposed models. All 3 proposed designs have identifiable features that distinguish their modification from the R2Y series, with the most advanced V3 variant appearing a massive step away from the original R2Y1 high-speed reconnaissance aircraft. Due to all of the forward thinking design choices the V3 was not chosen for the same reason as the V2.
