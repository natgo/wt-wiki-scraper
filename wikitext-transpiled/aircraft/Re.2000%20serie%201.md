== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Re.2000 was a monoplane fighter developed in Italy during the mid 1930s. It was one of the first modern fighters used in the Regia Aeronautica and it also saw use in the Swedish Air Force by the name [[J20]]. The design team took inspiration from the American Seversky P-35. The aircraft was considered an outstanding dogfighter, proving superior to the more modern Macchi C.200s and Messerschmitt Bf 109 Es in flight trials. However, the aircraft was not deemed satisfactory by the Italian military, and its manufacturer exported most of the produced units to Hungary and Sweden. The aircraft served as a basis for future models like the [[Re.2001 (Family)|2001]], [[Re.2002 Early|2002]], 2003, 2004 and [[Re.2005 serie 0|2005]] fighters.

Introduced in [[Update 1.77 "Advancing Storm"]], the Re.2000 serie 1 is a very good dogfighter. For its BR, it has a very good acceleration at top speeds and amazing climb rate, outperforming many early fighters like early Bf 109s. The Re.2000 can be used effectively in both energy fighting and turn fighting. For the former, it's better to have the energy advantage, and use the good dive performance of the aircraft to its advantage. To get good positions, it is a good idea to start climbing at the start of the match, to an altitude of around 3,000-4,000 m. The Re.2000 should look out for enemies like the Spitfire and I-16, since these two can outturn you while not sacrificing too much performance in level flight, like biplanes.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
This Italian plane is best used as an energy fighter and can be a very good start to learn how to use Italian planes.

The plane climbs and dives very well, it can reach a high speed quickly, but like every Italian plane in this rank, controls will be stiff above 500 km/h (310 mph) IAS.

The best performance is between 400 to 500 km/h (248 to 310 mph) IAS, but in level flight the max speed is 450 km/h IAS.

To be in the above-mentioned speed range, climb up to 3,000 m, and then dive onto the enemy. If the enemy is more than 2 km below, cut your throttle to 0% and only increase once at the same altitude as the enemy and started to losing speed. Diving or climbing straight at a 90-degree angle will cause the engine to shut down due to fuel cut-off.

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* No armour plates
* Self-sealing fuel tanks

{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (300 rpg = 600 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Re.2000 Series 1 is an air superiority aircraft and can be used as an energy fighter or as a dogfighter. It has a good acceleration when using WEP but the engine in WEP overheats very quickly. Thanks to the structure of the aircraft, it can dive without problem at high speeds and retain that speed and momentum, making it excellent for boom and zoom fights. With its combat flaps, it can turn quickly, making it capable in a dogfight while you have your energy. The 12.7 mm SAFAT MGs are excellent against light and armoured enemy aircraft. Be aware though of the limited ammo for the 12.7 mm machine guns, only 300 rounds per gun. This means trigger discipline will be important. In the end it is a fighter capable of fighting in any situation without having too many downsides.

Once in game, climb up to 3,000 m and start gaining speed. If the enemy is at the same altitude, dodge any attempt at a head on, and try to out-turn/out-climb them.

If an enemy is below, dive down and attack. If you overshoot them, conduct a yo-yo manoeuvre to get back on their tail.

Some enemies to be concerned about are:

* [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]]: The early versions carrying eight machine guns in their wings and will likely out turn you.
* [[P-26 (Family)|P-26]]: Especially the version that carries a 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun.
* Any biplane: Most of these are very good turners. They can earn back speed after multiple turns very quickly, so in a dogfight, the Re.2000 might feel sluggish. Don't get baited into these turn fights and instead use the speed/climb to fly away towards an advantageous position to attack.

When going against the Re.2000 serie 1, one will find head-ons effective against a Re.2000 since it only has two 12.7s machine guns. If you're in a head-on against one, shoot a small burst, and escape with a barrel roll. If one is on your six, either run away at high speed or make some speed costly manoeuvres, and turn onto his six. Never try to follow one in a climb, and if one is diving on you, you can dodge it easily due to its control stiffening and average roll rate.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The first project of the Reggiane design office was the Re.2000 which was designed by Italian engineers Alessio and Longhi. The first test flight was flown by Mario de Bernardi in 1939. With a superior engine in comparison to the FIAT powered MC.200, it was thought to be at least as manoeuvrable as the Bf 109 E in comparative trials, though the positioning of the fuel tank in an unarmoured wing centre section was found to be a fatal drawback and thus it was not accepted into Italian service, however, the Re.2000 was sold to both Sweden and Hungary to complement their air forces. During 1940, the Italian Navy ordered a modified version for carrier use with a Piaggio P.XI bis engine and structural strengthening for catapult launching and carrier landings.<ref>Thompson, Jonathan W., Italian Civil and Military Aircraft 1930-1945, Aero Publishers, Los Angeles (1963), 304 pages.</ref>

Hungary bought 70 Re.2000s and built another 192. Sweden bought 60, where they stayed in service until 1946. Britain had actually put in an order for 300, as well, before the onset of war prevented it. Those few of the 188 that were built by the Reggiane company that were not sold to other countries were used by an Italian squadron on Sicily in 1941/42, or converted for catapult use.
