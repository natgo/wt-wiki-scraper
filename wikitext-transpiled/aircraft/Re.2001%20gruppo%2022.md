== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Re.2001 Group 22 is the Re.2001 belonging to the 22nd Autonomous Land Fighter Group founded on 5 July 1918 with the 181st Squadron and 182nd Squadron of Caproni Ca.40s, whose 22nd Group participated in World War I, after the outbreak of World War II participated on the Eastern Front, in the Naval Air War in the Mediterranean where it received the first Re.2001s and after the end of World War II was renamed the Interceptor Group and integrated into the 51st Squadron.

The Re.2001 Group 22 is the premium version of the [[Re.2001 serie 1|Re.2001 Series I]] introduced with the [[Update "Starfighters"|"Starfighters" update]] the vehicle has good manoeuvrability even when it is not very fast, using the combat flaps you can increase the manoeuvrability but losing a lot of speed, in fact you have to keep the engine on WEP but not for too long because it is not well cooled the engine will tend to overheat and break, finally the armament composed of two 12.7mm and two 7.7mm can cause good damage to the enemy.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
This Italian plane is best used as an energy fighter and can be a very good start to learn how to use Italian planes. The plane climbs and dives very well, it can reach a high speed quickly, but like every Italian plane in this rank, controls will be stiff above 500 km/h (310 mph) IAS. The best performance is between 400 to 500 km/h (248 to 310 mph) IAS, but in a swallow level flight the max speed is 450 km/h IAS. To be in the above-mentioned speed range, climb up to 3,000 m, and then dive onto the enemy. If the enemy is more than 2 km below, cut your throttle to 0% and only increase once at the same altitude as the enemy and started to losing speed. Diving or climbing straight at a 90-degree angle will cause the engine to shut down due to fuel cut-off. With its excellent structure, it is able to reach a top speed of 760 km/h in a dive and surprisingly it does not suffer from the reduction in manoeuvrability due to the high speed. It is not recommended keeping the WEP for a long time as the aircraft is not very cooled and could overheat in a short time.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm steel - Pilot's seat
* 8 mm steel - Behind pilot
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (below pilot)

The Re.2001 gruppo 22 is a very solid fighter and resistant to fires. Its fuselage can withstand rifle-calibre MG fire. Unfortunately, this aircraft is not equipped with bulletproof glass, which makes it very disadvantageous in frontal attack.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (350 rpg = 700 total)
* 2 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, wing-mounted (600 rpg = 1,200 total)

For belts, it is recommended to use standard bullets for the 7.7 mm MGs and tracer bullets for the 12.7 mm MGs.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Re.2001 gruppo 22 is a fairly easy aircraft to operate. It is an airplane more focused on energy fighting, but with the right conditions it is able to give an excellent turnfighting airplane, being able to keep up with more manoeuvrable aircraft such as [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]]. Being a very balanced aircraft, it adapts to the playstyle of almost every player, it is recommended to take altitude and stay in the medium-low altitude range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very good acceleration
* Short take off distance
* Very good structural resistance
* Good climb rate
* Lots of ammunition
* Very good as energy fighter but also good at low altitude
* Good retention of combat speed and energy
* Flaps have a high rip speed

'''Cons:'''

* Very bad engine cooling, it overheats after a short while
* Total absence of bulletproof glass, disadvantage in frontal attack
* When it reaches a certain speed begins to stagger to the left and right, many difficulties in aiming

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

=== Development ===

The Re.2001 fighter biplane was developed by Roberto Longhi, an Italian aeronautic engineer, who designed various planes such as the [[Re.2000 (Family)|Re.2000]], [[Re.2001 (Family)|Re.2001]], [[Re.2002 Early|Re.2002]], Re.2003, Re.2004 and many others. During the production of the Re.2000, Roberto Longhi started to design a new plane with a powerful engine and after it will become the Re.2001.

The first flight of the Re.2001 took place between 22 and 24 June 1940 specifically the first prototype MM.409, later many variants were built and after the armistice of Italy, were used on both sides by both the RSI and Italy Co-belligerent Air Force. The Re.2001 participated the War on Malta, the Mediterranean theatre and the air defense of RSI.

the Re.2001 Serie I has an Alfa Romeo R.A.1000 RC.41 that gives very good performances in flight with a good acceleration and a good speed of the airplane of 543 km/h at 5,470 m of altitude but had problems of reliability the engine because it could overheat too much and damage the engine, the airplane as armament has two [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|12,7 mm Breda-SAFAT]] and two [[Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm Breda SAFAT]].

the '''Re.2001''' was used by Italy and Germany.

=== 22°Gruppo ===
[[File:Re.2001 22°Gruppo 2.png|thumb|Re.2001 22°Gruppo during air surveillance]]
From its full name "22°Gruppo Autonomo caccia terrestre", 22nd autonomous group, the 22° Gruppo was born in July 1918 and fought during WW2 on the Eastern front from 29 July 1941 until March 1942, then returned on 4 May 1942 where at the end of June the Group received the first Re.2001 (at the beginning Re.2001 CB and some Re.2001 Serie I). After receiving these aircraft, the 22° Gruppo participated in the aeronaval war in the Mediterranean. After this, the 22°Gruppo fought during the Air Defence of Italy and at the end of the Second World War was renamed Gruppo Intercettori and integrated to the 51° Stormo.
