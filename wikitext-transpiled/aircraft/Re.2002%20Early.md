== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
While the Re.2002 looks like a modernized variant of the Re.2000 (and is, in fact, a design derived from the Re.2000), one must never forget the Re.2002 was designed to be a fighter bomber, not a pure-bred fighter. It does have a more powerful engine, but its overall weight is noticeably higher. Combined with rather bad climb rate and mediocre manoeuvrability, the Re.2002 is really an attacker disguised as a fighter. It is thus recommended to treat it like a single-seat attacker and use the corresponding playstyle.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 8 mm Steel - Pilot's seat
* 8 mm Steel - Armoured plate behind the pilot
* 50 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen
* Critical components located at the front of aircraft (pilot, engine, controls)
* Fuel tank in the fuselage behind the pilot
* More fuel tanks located in wings near the fuselage

=== Offensive armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (390 rpg left + 450 rpg right = 840 total)
* 2 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, wing-mounted (630 rpg = 1,260 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|GP 50 (50 kg)|GP 100T (100 kg)|GP 250 (250 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 1 x 250 kg GP 250 bomb (250 kg total)
* 1 x 250 kg GP 250 bomb + 2 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (350 kg total)
* 1 x 250 kg GP 250 bomb + 2 x 100 kg GP 100T bombs (450 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Given its low manoeuvrability, bad climb rate and low speed, the Re.2002 should be used as a single-seat attacker. For this purpose, it can carry quite a formidable payload for its size and rank - a single 250 kg bomb and up to 2 x 100 kg bombs, which adds up to 450 kg. In the air RB, this payload will come in handy for destroying a pillbox or two or knocking out some tanks, and you can use your MGs against softer targets.

However, if you do end up in an engagement, note that you can even deploy your take-off flaps up to 428 km/h, which when combined with brief bursts of WEP can sometimes provide a nasty surprise for an enemy fighter that thought it had the low-altitude manoeuvre advantage against all those slow, vulnerable ground-attack planes. And low-altitude fights are the ones you are likely to have in this machine.

However, it is in ground RB where the machine is truly useful. Given its low battle rating, its top payload is fully able to destroy any tank on the given BR spread and its 250 kg bomb has enough punch to knock out multiple targets if you're lucky (or skilled) enough to hit a cluster of thin-skinned vehicles. You can also use the Re.2002 as an impromptu dive bomber with the advantage of being able to defend itself against enemy fighters. But don't mistake the Re.2002 for a proper CAS plane, as it lacks the payload and the armour protection for repeated attacks, especially against prepared AA defense. The Re.2002 is thus great for hit and run attacks, after which you can either return to your airfield and rearm, or you can climb a little and try to pick off any sneaking enemy CAS aircraft.

With a subpar agility, climb rate and speed, but possessing a good payload for its rank, the Re.2002 is an attacker disguised as a fighter and should never be brought into a direct dogfight. Also, beware of head-on engagements: the only thing protecting your pilot from the front is a small piece of armoured glass and a large Piaggio radial engine that loves to catch fire.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good payload for its rank
* Large ammunition supply for its guns
* Armament is great for destroying light ground targets (AAA, artillery, armoured cars, etc.)
* Has armour, like the [[Re.2000 G.A.|previous vehicle]]

'''Cons:'''

* Subpar agility
* Low climb rate
* Engine overheats quickly even with all modifications researched

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Re. 2002 was a return to the radial engine, combining the new structural features of the Re. 2001 with an engine comparable to the Re. 2000's. Agile and sturdy, it was the best fighter-bomber/attack plane the Italians had, and was respected by the Luftwaffe, who seized 60 of them when Italy surrendered. In total, 225 were built, the last 40 for the Luftwaffe. Another 40 continued on with Italian forces fighting with the Allies.

Reggiane had been unable to find sufficient DB 601 engines (being produced on license in Italy) to keep up with demand for the Re. 2001, so they switched back to a Piaggio-designed radial. This meant the wing system of the Re. 2001 could be kept in the new model. It first flew in October, 1940, and the Italian Air Force placed its first order in September, 1941. It first became operational in July of 1943, during the invasion of Sicily.
