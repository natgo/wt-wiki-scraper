== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In 1933, the Regia Marina asked the Italian aeronautical industries for a new reconnaissance seaplane to replace the Piaggio P.6 and CANT 25 already in use on some cruisers. One of these aeronautical companies was IMAM, and thanks to Giovanni Galasso the IMAM Ro.37 Bis was modified into a seaplane version for maritime reconnaissance. Modifying the Ro.37 Bis with a different wing configuration and a central float to better balance the aircraft, the Ro.43 was born, took off for the first time on 19 November 1934, and won the competition issued by the Regia Marina, even exceeding the specifications required by the Navy itself.

Introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]], the Ro.43 is the only catapult-able aircraft from Italian ships in the game. It is equipped with an armament of only two 7.7 mm frontal guns and a defensive turret with a 7.7 mm, which are not very powerful but do the job. This is an excellent aircraft for shooting down other enemy seaplanes present from other nations' ships, thanks to its engine it also manages to quickly regain speed even after capturing a point, and the smoke screen can be used to protect both yourself and your allies when sailing in open waters.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
Ro.43 has a typical performance for shipborne biplane - it's extremely agile, but relatively slow in level flight, making for a relatively easy target for any fighter or even most bombers.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Similarly to other shipborne aircraft, the Ro.43 is extremely easy to destroy, rarely surviving more than a single hit from anything larger than 13.2 mm.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine gun, dorsal turret (500 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ro.43 is best-used much in the same fashion as other hydroplanes with offensive armament are - going for the capture point, taking down enemy hydroplanes and capturing it for the team. [[Shipboard reconnaissance aircraft#Uses|Other uses]] are typical for the airplane of the type - spotting, laying [[Smoke screen#Naval Forces|smokescreen]], and harassing enemy airplanes.

Generally it's best to keep away from enemy bluewater vessels and high-BR coastal boats, as the sheer volume of fire they can unleash is typically enough to take the hydroplane down even from 2 kilometres with just the use of automated AI gunners.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Optimal acceleration
* Very manoeuvrable
* Pilot-operated offensive armament

'''Cons:'''

* It has no access to bombs, restricting its ability to damage ships
* Offensive armament although present is very weak, struggling with anything else than other hydroplanes
* Quite heavy

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
