== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was an Italian fighter floatplane developed by IMAM as a single seat variant of the IMAM Ro.43 reconnaissance plane. It underwent its first flight in October 1936. Unlike the Ro.43, the main armament was changed from two 7.7 mm machine guns to two 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns in the nose. The tail as well as the rear fuselage where the observer was stationed previously were redesigned. The Ro.44 shared the same issues of the Ro.43 it was developed from, such as problems with buoyancy and sea-handling issues due to the lightweight design and structure. Out of 51 ordered, only 35 were built, and they were used solely in the Aegean Sea with 161 Squadriglia. It was retired from frontlines and sent to seaplane schools shortly after the start of WWII.

The Ro.44 was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], finally equipping all the naval nations with at least 1 [[:Category:Hydroplanes|seaplane]] to use, although many are not regular tree units. Its ability to capture naval points makes it invaluable for naval players. The plane itself is no match for other reserve biplanes such as He-51, or I-15 that outperform the Ro.44 in both speed and manoeuvrability.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Ro.44 is reasonably durable, being able to take a fair amount of rife-calibre machine gun fire before the flight performance is crippled. The large radial engine too, although vulnerable to being hit due to its size, tends to keep running even with a fair amount of battle damage. The aircraft has no armour protection for the pilot.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (220 rpg = 440 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ro.44 fulfils the role of a dogfighter in battles, boasting fantastic low speed handling (down to as low as 130 km/h) which often gives it the edge in low-rank dogfights. Its powerful armament of twin 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns (a rare armament at such a low BR) usually means it can quickly dispose of enemy aircraft. Against faster monoplane enemies such as the P-36, P-400 or MiG-3, you'll want to enter the fight with an altitude advantage and convert that to speed, giving you enough time to cripple the enemy aircraft even if they choose to use their speed advantage and extend.

In Simulator battles, the Ro.44 currently uses an identical cockpit model to the CR.32, so there are discrepancies between the cockpit model and the actual layout of the aircraft. The Italian floatplane also handles terribly in Simulator mode, having a constant pitch up attitude analogous to having full flaps extended on any other aircraft. Combined with having no trim, the Ro.44 is tiresome to fly in simulator battles, and currently also has poor forward-facing visibility from the cockpit.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Excellent low speed handling
* Reasonably durable
* Acceptable climb rate
* Excellent weaponry for its BR, mounted on the centreline
* Good amount of ammunition
* Can capture points in naval battles

'''Cons:'''

* Fairly slow
* Radial engine is a large target
* Loses energy rapidly in vertical manoeuvres
* Low dive speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The '''IMAM Ro.44''' was a single seat fighter seaplane derivative of the [[Ro.43]] and first flew in October 1936. By taking out the rear gunners positions and all the extra equipment and radios, the much lighter aircraft gained in manoeuvrability but barely any speed increase. At a distance, both the Ro.44 and Ro.43 are practically indistinguishable due to the copied design. It also did not improve on its predecessor for seaworthiness, being too difficult to land in open ocean. In the end it was a disappointment, with its order reduced from 50 to 35 and being soon used as trainer for advanced pilots.
