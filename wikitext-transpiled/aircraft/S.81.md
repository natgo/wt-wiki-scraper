== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]].

The S.81 is distinctive with its three engines, two on the wings and one in the nose. This provides a level of redundancy with the nose engine unlikely to be disabled except from a head-on or a diving attack. Although, each engine is less powerful than contemporaries on other aircraft so each engine loss will heavily impact the aircraft's speed, causing it to lose altitude. Losing one engine on the wing would also cause the aircraft to start rolling over to the weakened end. However, if you manage to land your plane after losing an engine, you will be able to taxi back to base at 100% power. It will be slow though, as you can only reach speeds up to 14 km/h.

The plane in its default state is covered in a light green paint with black splotches around to break up the solid figure. A huge white band stretch out at the mid-section of the fuselage, right around the beam turrets, which could serve as reference points for enemies to knockout the beam and ventral turret gunners. On the tail's vertical stabilizer, a large white cross is also present with the logo of the ''Regia Aeronautica'' in the upper centre point of the paint. On the wings, the ''Regia Aeronautica'' roundels were also present to make the vehicle certainly belonging to the Italian tech tree.

Three types of turrets are available on the S.81, a dorsal turret on top, a ventral turret on the bottom, and two beam turrets for both sides of the fuselage. All the turrets provide an excellent arc of fires on their sectors, with mutual machine gun fire from more than one turret able to be met in most areas. Unfortunately, all the turrets used a 7.7 mm machine gun and while sustained fire could cause sufficient damage, they lack the quick stopping power needed to prevent fighters from strafing the bomber, and taking down enemy fighters quickly is crucial as the S.81 lacks any sort of armour for itself and the crew except self-sealing fuel tanks. Enemy machine-gun fire will quickly go through, damaging modules and crew members.

S.81 is a well armed beginner bomber for Italy, being able to carry a heavy load of bombs in different sizes. Though it doesn't possess the greatest speed, it's still a bomber for the enemy team to recognize as a threat for its carrying capacity of bombs. Being mixed up with bombers from other nations like [[He 111 H-3]], [[F.222.2]], or [[TB-3M-17-32]], they can easily wipe out enemy bases and airfield.

S.81 is armed with 6 x 7.7 mm machine guns: 2 x [[Lewis (7.7 mm)]] and 4 x [[Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)]] which is pretty well armed for a low tier bomber. The two Lewis machine guns are placed at the middle rear of the plane in the sides, where they can cover if enemy planes are flying level next to the S.81. Meanwhile, the 4 x Breda machine guns are placed in two turrets that have 360° coverage above and below the bomber, being able to defend it from most angles. It is able to defend itself pretty well against biplanes from reserve ranks, but can have tougher opponents like [[I-16 type 24]], [[Yak-2 KABB]], [[P-36G]], [[He 100 D-1]], [[Potez 631]], and [[J22-A]] that can make quick work of the S.81 as they are faster, more agile, and usually have more firepower than the S.81.

S.81 is able to carry 28 x 50 kg bombs, 16 x 100 kg bombs, 4 x 250 kg bombs or 4 x 500 kg bombs. Bombloads like 28 x 50 kg and 16 x 100 kg are excellent for carpet bombing convoys and knocking out light targets, meanwhile heavier bombloads like 4 x 250 kg and 4 x 500 kg are excellent for destroying bombing points and damaging airfields. They are all useful in ground battles.

Best use of S.81 in Air Battles is on clean up duty after other bombers that are way faster and might not have the bombload to take out bombing points in one go, or S.81 can go for stationary targets like pillboxes, light pillboxes, AA emplacements and artillery positions to bleed the enemy team's tickets.

In ground battles the S.81 can be good air support for allied ground units, protecting points that are being captured by hostile forces and with good communications with the ground teammates it can wipe out entrenched enemies that are likely to be protecting points or certain roads or areas of the map. But beware of enemy SPAA units, the S.81's slow speed makes it an easy target for most SPAA vehicles at its battle rating.

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Great payload, can carry up to 2,000 kg of ordnance which can destroy 3 bases with ease
- Machine gun turrets can reach all sides of the bomber
- Potent, fast-firing defensive armament for its tier, with incendiary bullets that can easily set fabric-covered low-tier planes on fire.

'''Cons:'''

- Slow and sluggish
- No armour or bulletproof glass for protection
- Loss of a single engine will hamper the plane's ability to stay in the air
- Low maximum altitude

Under the need to have an aircraft capable reaching the far reaches of the Italian colonies in Africa, a project was made to develop an aircraft able to suit the Regia Aeronautica. Approaching manufacturer Savoia-Marchetti, chief designer Alessandro Marchetti developed the aircraft based on the Savoia's SM.73 airliner and militarized the vehicle for its intended use.<ref name="MFS.81">Military Factory. "Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 Pipistrello (Bat) Medium Bomber / Transport Aircraft." Military Factory, 31 May 2017, [http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=811 Website].</ref> The first prototype was built and flown in early 1935, approximately six months after the SM.73 debuted.<ref name="CenturyS.81">Century of Flight. "Savoia Marchetti S.M.81 Pipistrello." Italian Aircraft of World War Two, 11 Nov 2007, [https://web.archive.org/web/20121102170519/https://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/photo_albums/timeline/ww2/Savoia%20Marchetti.htm Web Archive].</ref> This aircraft was then known as the '''SM.81''' "Pipistrello" ("Bat"). The aircraft was accepted for service in the same year with mass-production slated, with different engines used throughout the production life. 534 SM.81 would be produced in the time span between 1935 to 1944.<ref name="MurphyS.81">Murphy, Justin D., and Matthew A. McNiece. Military Aircraft, 1919-1945: an Illustrated History of Their Impact. ABC-CLIO, 2009.</ref>

===Combat usage===
At its inception, the SM.81 was considered one of the better medium bombers of the era with its top speed of 211 miles, long range of 1,336 miles, well armed with six machine gun positions and able to carry a payload of up to 2,205 lbs.<ref name="MurphyS.81" /> The SM.81 found a versatile use on the battlefield, being used in a transport, bombing, ground attack, and a reconnaissance role, ensuring its relevancy even later in the war. One was procured by Benito Mussolini to be used as his private aircraft, the aircraft being nicknamed "Taratuga" ("Turtle") for its sluggish speed.

The SM.81 was first used in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (also known as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War), lasting from 03 October 1935 to May 1936, quickly putting the SM.81 into action. Their versatile performed well in their support of the Italian troops, culminating with the annexation of Ethiopia into Italy's East African colonies. The SM.81 saw use again in the Spanish Civil War to aid the Spanish Nationalists in the Aviazione Legionaria, where they were used to the same degree as in Ethiopia. Though 12 were sent on a 705-mile flight on 29 July 1936 to Spanish-controlled Morocco, complexity in the flight had only nine arrive. These nine bombers provided a great asset in the Strait of Gibraltar as more aircraft arrived, keeping the Spanish Republican's Navy at bay. As the Nationalists push closer to Madrid, the SM.81, working alongside the German Condor Legion, bombed the Spanish capital almost daily. Though the SM.81 sometimes flew with escorting [[CR.32_(Family)|C.R.32]] biplanes, flying unescorted with tight formations was also possible due to the mutual machine gun protection with each other.<ref name="SmithS.81">Smith, Richard K., and R. Cargill. Hall. Five down, No Glory: Frank G. Tinker, Mercenary Ace in the Spanish Civil War. Naval Institute Press, 2011.</ref> However, when Soviet [[I-15_M-22|I-15]] and [[I-16 type 5|I-16]] appeared, flights started to be conducted at night to avoid losing precious bombers. When Italy left Spain at the conclusion of the war, around 64 SM.81 was left behind for the Spanish Air Force.

By the outbreak of World War II, the SM.81 was showing its age, though 300 units still remained in the Regia Aeronautica's inventory.<ref name="MFS.81" /> With the faster and more powerful [[S.M.79_(Family)|SM.79]] beginning to see service in 1936, the SM.81's roles was supplemented. The SM.81 still saw service in secondary roles and so deliveries still continued. It was used in the African theater as the main bomber against British forces in East Africa, but British [[Gladiator_Mk_II|Gladiators]] and [[Hurricane_(Family)|Hurricanes]] posed a major threat. Due to this the SM.81 was relegated as a night bomber in North Africa, with the darkness as cover against the enemy fighters. 80 SM.81 were also produced into a dedicated transport aircraft, known as ''SM.81T'', which proved vital in transporting troops and material to Rommel's Afrika Korps.<ref name="MurphyS.81" />

Even after Italy's surrender to Allied forces in September 1943, the SM.81 still saw service in North Italy's Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana and South Italy's Aviazione Cobelligerante Italiana. Though South Italy soon removed them from service, North Italy used them until the end of the war.<ref name="MFS.81" /> In the conclusion of World War II, several SM.81 were still in service with the post-war Aeronautica Militare Italiana, sticking around until 1950 when they were all officially retired.

===Other developments===
Two main variants of the SM.81 existed, the SM.81 as a bomber/transport variant and the SM.81T as a dedicated transport aircraft, both using various engines as propulsion. A project was done known as the ''SM.81B'', which used a two-engine configuration. This provided inadequate performance compared to the three-engine configurations and so the project was discontinued.

Though the SM.81 saw use in the various Italian air forces and in Spain, three were also sent to the Chinese Nationalist forces, arriving at an unknown date. However, all three samples were destroyed in training exercises in early 1938.<ref name="MFS.81" />
