== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27 in the German aviation tree. In [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]], the S.M.79, as well as the other Italian planes in the German tree, were moved to the new Italian tree.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

With a significantly higher BR than the previous two Sparviero models, the 1941 Sparviero features the same bomb load-outs (but can also carry a single torpedo) and armament, with only relatively minor increases in performance. While unable to compete with the Ju 88 or the He 111 H-6 and Fw 200 C-1 Condor in terms of performance or sheer bomb-carrying capacity, respectively, the S.M.79 AS can still perform decently if played carefully.

It is very important to avoid fighters in the S.M.79, as it has a lot of defensive fire dead-zones and is not as durable as the Ju 88. If an enemy fighter is foolish enough to stay within the reach of the 12.7 mm Breda-SAFATs, they can deal a considerable amount of damage to the pursuer. However, the gunners themselves have no armour protection and can be knocked out fairly easily.

Due to the relatively light payload carried by the S.M.79, it is not particularly recommended to go base bombing, even with the max load of 5 x 250 kg bombs. It is better to dive towards ground level and destroy targets like tanks or vehicles, as this will make it harder for enemies to attack you from below, where the Sparviero has very limited defensive fire coverage. The 500 kg bombs reduce your total bombload to only 1,000 kg, but they are more forgiving of poor bomb aiming and can take out pillboxes with a single hit. Be wary of attacks from the sides, as only the weak 7.7 mm machine guns cover the flanks of the Sparviero.

=== Pros and cons ===
''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

- Can carry a torpedo

'''Cons:'''

- Poor survivability

Three-engine SIAI Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 "Sparviero" medium torpedo bomber, issued 1941.

By early 1941 the number of "Sparvieros" in the Italian Royal Air Force began to decrease. The more advanced CANT Z.1007 "Alcione", also a three-engined plane, was replacing the ageing S.M.79. However, the "Sparviero" soon had another, just as important role as the primary "workhorse" of Italian naval aviation.

In March 1937, one of the S.M.79s was equipped with a special torpedo sight, and under the fuselage a left-offset suspension rack was installed for an 860 kg 450 mm torpedo. In November 1937, the plane passed all flight tests. In March 1938, a new version which carried two torpedoes was tested. This time, results were not so good, since the weight hindered the plane's controllability. Consequently, the variant accepted was the one-torpedo version. Beginning in late 1939, all S.M.79 production aircraft were fitted with torpedo mounts.

The S.M.79 torpedo bombers had virtually the same design as the regular bombers. Their crew was increased by one person: a naval observation officer, who sat between radio operator and mechanic. From 1941 on, the engines were equipped first with extended tailpipes, and then with Wellington flame arresters. Arresters were also installed on the barrels of the machine guns.

In 1942, the Alfa-Romeo 126RC34 engines were equipped with an ethanol injection system, which allowed a short engine output boost to 900 hp, increasing the plane's speed by 50 km/h. But this reduced the engine's life span, which was already unsatisfactory.

On July 25, 1940, the first experimental torpedo squadron, containing five aircraft, was founded. It was an S.M.79 from this group that launched the first torpedo attack on the ships in the Egyptian port of Alexandria on August 15, 1940.

By early 1942, the Italian torpedo bombers had become a major force to be reckoned with. By November 1942 there were 147 S.M.79 torpedo bombers in service, in nine groups.

In June and August 1942, the Italians persistently attacked British convoys breaking through to Malta with moderate success, but they themselves lost about 50 S.M.79s, with experienced crews.
