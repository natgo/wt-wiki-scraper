== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. Though initially in the game pre-1.27, this plane was removed upon [[Update 1.37]] due to redundancy.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Due to its relatively low battle rating, the three-engined S.M.79 enjoys a relatively high speed for a bomber against most of the lower ranked opposition it faces. This aids its survivability, particularly in a shallow dive. Unfortunately, it is rather lacking in bombload options compared to the He 111s and Ju 88s and also has rather poor defensive fire arcs. Unlike the German bombers, however, it is armed with 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns which can pack quite a punch against the flimsier aircraft it faces. The pilot also controls a fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which is otherwise uncovered by any defensive armament. This gun can be useful for strafing light vehicles and trucks that will be encountered frequently in low-rank battles and can be used to shoot down other aircraft. It is somewhat more manoeuvrable than the He 111 H-3, but the Sparviero is by no means a fighter and will rapidly lose energy in turns. With the ability to carry 500 kg bombs, the S.M.79 can use these to more easily take out pillboxes and heavier tanks, although this reduces the total bombload to only 1,000 kg as opposed to 1,250 kg with 250 kg bombs.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Hard-hitting 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT defensive machine guns
* Pilot-controlled fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which can be equipped with IAI (explosive) ammunition
* High speed
* Middle engine provides some level of protection for the pilot against head-on attacks
* Capable of carrying 500 kg bombs, unlike the He 111 H-3 or Do 17 Z-1

'''Cons:'''

* Poor total bomb load compared to the He 111 H-3 (1,250 kg max)
* Poor defensive fire arcs, including a dead zone in the rear where neither of the rearward facing 12.7 mm machine guns can cover
* No frontal defensive gun covering the frontal aspect
* Lacks armour protection for the crew
* Forced to choose between less total bomb load but individually more powerful bombs or higher total bomb load with less powerful bombs

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

Three-engine SIAI Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79bis "Sparviero" medium torpedo bomber, issued 1942.

In 1941, the S.M.79 "Sparviero" began to be replaced by the new S.84 torpedo bomber. But the S.84's engine, the Piaggio P.XI, was so unreliable that in 1942 groups which had switched to the new plane returned to the S.M.79.

The S.M.79 was independently modified in several ways, which slightly improved the aircraft's flight characteristics. For example, one "Sparviero" had its engine mount elongated, which improved the aircraft's aerodynamics and thus increased its speed.

Savoia-Marchetti designers proposed upgrading the outdated S.M.79 by replacing its mixed design with an all-metal airframe. This would substantially reduce the aircraft's weight while increasing the strength of its airframe. But the Royal Italian Air Force chose a compromise, instead: change the power unit, but keep the S.M.79's old airframe. The resulting variant was named the S.M.79bis.

The S.M.79bis was powered by three 9-cylinder radial air-cooled Alfa-Romeo 128RC18 engines with 860 hp and a metal three-bladed variable-pitch SIAI.32 propeller.

The new engine could not perform as well at high altitudes as the older Alfa-Romeo 126RC34, and so it was more suited for low-flying torpedo bombers. Increasing the engine's power slightly increased the aircraft's maximum and cruise speeds. The alcohol injection system, developed for the engine Alfa-Romeo 126RC34, was retained.

The ventral gondola, along with the machine gun mounted inside, was unnecessary for a torpedo bomber and was removed. When attacking, the torpedo bomber would fly just over the crests of the waves.

The empty bomb bay held an extra 1,000-litre fuel tank (a 2,300-litre option was also available). The plane's radio equipment and instruments were upgraded, as well.

The S.M.79bis was chosen to be the standard torpedo bomber, and previously released planes were converted into the new variant.

Of the first S.M.79bis planes built, a special unit was formed to attack British ships in Gibraltar during "Operazione Scoglio" (Operation "The Rock"). However, while preparing the attack, it was discovered that the fuel consumption rating of the S.M.79bis engine was overstated, and the planes would not be able to fly the mission to Gibraltar from the intended starting point of Istria (in the South of France). Only two of the most experienced crews tried to fly the mission on June 19, 1943, but only one returned; the second landed in Spain, out of fuel. On June 24 the whole group carried out a raid on Oran in Algeria.
