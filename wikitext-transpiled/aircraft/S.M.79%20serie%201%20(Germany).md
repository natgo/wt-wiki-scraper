== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27 in the German aviation tree. In [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]], the S.M.79, as well as the other Italian planes in the German tree, were moved to the new Italian tree, although it still exists in the German tree for those who unlocked it prior to Update 1.69.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Due to its relatively low battle rating, the three-engined S.M.79 enjoys a relatively high speed for a bomber against most of the lower ranked opposition it faces. This aids its survivability, particularly in a shallow dive. Unfortunately, it is rather lacking in bombload options compared to the He 111s and Ju 88s and also has rather poor defensive fire arcs. Unlike the German bombers, however, it is armed with 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns which can pack quite a punch against the flimsier aircraft it faces. The pilot also controls a fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which is otherwise uncovered by any defensive armament. This gun can be useful for strafing light vehicles and trucks that will be encountered frequently in low-rank battles and can be used to shoot down other aircraft. It is somewhat more manoeuvrable than the He 111 H-3, but the Sparviero is by no means a fighter and will rapidly lose energy in turns. With the ability to carry 500 kg bombs, the S.M.79 can use these to more easily take out pillboxes and heavier tanks, although this reduces the total bombload to only 1,000 kg as opposed to 1,250 kg with 250 kg bombs.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Hard-hitting 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT defensive machine guns
* Pilot-controlled fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which can be equipped with IAI (explosive) ammunition
* High speed
* Middle engine provides some level of protection for the pilot against head-on attacks
* Capable of carrying 500 kg bombs, unlike the He 111 H-3 or Do 17 Z-1

'''Cons:'''

* Poor total bomb load compared to the He 111 H-3 (1,250 kg max)
* Poor defensive fire arcs, including a dead zone in the rear where neither of the rearward facing 12.7 mm machine guns can cover
* No frontal defensive gun covering the frontal aspect
* Lacks armour protection for the crew
* Forced to choose between less total bomb load but individually more powerful bombs or higher total bomb load with less powerful bombs

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

Three-engine SIAI Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 "Sparviero" medium bomber, first series, issued 1936.

A mixed-construction monoplane with a retractable landing gear system including tail wheel. Crew: 4-5. Created in the SIAI (Societa Idrovolanti Alta Italia) design firm, led by Alessandro Marchetti, as a passenger aircraft. The prototype S.M.79 in passenger configuration (civil designation I-MAGO) made its first flight on October 8, 1934.

The prototype S.M.79 bomber (serial number M.M.20663) first flew on July 8, 1936. Serial production began in November 1936.

The S.M.79 was powered by three 9-cylinder radial air-cooled Alfa-Romeo 126RC34 engines with 780 hp and a metal variable-pitch SIAI propeller.

The typical wide box-shaped fuselage of passenger planes was retained. But the characteristic dorsal "hump" in the fuselage was implemented and became the S.M.79's lifelong hallmark. Because of this, the aircraft earned the nickname "Gobbo" ("Hunchback").

In front of the "hump", a fixed 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine gun with 350 rounds of ammunition was installed. The pilot directed the machine gun's fire. In the rear of the hump, a pivoting 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine gun with 500 rounds of ammunition was installed.

In the tail section, under the bomber's fuselage, a pivot mount was installed with a 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine gun with 500 rounds of ammunition. In addition, a 7.7 mm Lewis machine gun with a rotary magazine (and 485 rounds of ammunition) was installed inside the fuselage. It was specially installed so that it could move from one side of the aircraft to the other. The gun was fired through large rectangular blisters located on the plane's port and starboard side.

The bomb bay was located in the central part of the fuselage and was offset slightly to the right to allow access to the aircraft's tail section. It could accommodate up to 1,200 kg of bombs in various combinations (2 x 500 kg, 5 x 250 kg, 12 x 100 kg, or 12 x 12 kg canisters of small fragmentation bombs). All of the bombs were hung vertically, except the 500 kg bombs, which were installed at an angle.

Once officially approved, the bomber was called the S.M.79 "Sparviero" ("Hawk"), but the name failed to stick, and combat units continued to call the plane the "hunchback".
