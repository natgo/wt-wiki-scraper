== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]], though a variant existed in the Germany aircraft tech tree prior to the update.

Due to its relatively low Battle Rating, the three-engined S.M.79 serie 1 enjoys a relatively high speed for a bomber against most of the lower tiered opposition it faces. This aids its survivability, particularly in a shallow dive. Unfortunately, it is rather lacking in bombload options compared to the He 111s and Ju 88s and also has rather poor defensive fire arcs.

Unlike the German bombers, however, it is armed with 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns which can pack quite a punch against the flimsier aircraft it faces. The pilot also controls a fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which is otherwise uncovered by any defensive armament. This gun can be useful for strafing light vehicles and trucks that will be encountered frequently in low tier battles and can be used to shoot down other aircraft. It is somewhat more manoeuvrable than the He 111 H-3, but the Sparviero is by no means a fighter and will rapidly lose energy in turns. With the ability to carry 500 kg bombs, the S.M.79 can use these to more easily take out pillboxes and heavier tanks, although this reduces the total bombload to only 1,000 kg as opposed to 1,250 kg with 250 kg bombs.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

S.M.79 serie 1 is a decent bomber at its BR and below, but it faces many threats, for example [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]], [[LaGG-3 (Family)|LaGG-3s]], [[MiG-3 (Family)|MiG-3s]] and [[P-40 (Family)|P-40s]].

If the S.M.79 manage to get past the threats, it jas the payload to take out enemy bomb points and ground targets, with its bomber spawn it can descend to get extra speed to quickly get to the bombing point, those this will also expose it to enemy fighters and attackers that have the firepower to destroy the S.M.79 with ease in both Realistic and Arcade battles.

A big drawback with the S.M.79 is that it's big and not fast or agile compared to certain bombers at same BR but if it is able to pass through enemy line it can cause a lot of damage to the points. It has 2 x 12.7 mm Breda MGs aiming backwards in a limited field of view making a lot of the plane uncovered by the MGs, as well as 2 x 7.7 mm Breda MGs on the sides, also with limited views, leaving a lot of the plane unprotected.

S.M.79 also has an offensive 12.7 mm which can do damage to enemy fighters or bombers, if one has a well trained aim, it can be a dangerous weapon to the S.M.79's advantage. The problem with the 12.7 mm is its slow rate of fire compared to other 12.7 mm and a low count of 350 rounds in the gun.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Hard-hitting 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT defensive machine guns.
- Pilot-controlled fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which can be equipped with IAI (explosive) ammunition.
- Good speed.
- Middle engine provides some level of protection for the pilot against head-on attacks.
- Capable of carrying 500 kg bombs, unlike the [[He 111 H-3]] or [[Do 17 Z-2]].

'''Cons:'''

- Very limited bomb payload compared to the He 111 H-3 which has 1,250 kg max.
- Poor defensive fire arcs, including a dead-zone in the rear where neither of the rearward facing 12.7 mm machine guns can cover.
- No frontal defensive gun covering the frontal aspect.
- Lacks armour protection for the crew.
- Forced to choose between less total bomb payload, but individually more powerful bombs or higher total bomb payload with less powerful bombs.

Alessandro Marchettí was famous for creating record breaking and Schneider Trophy winning racing seaplanes, and was the Savoia (aka SIAI, Società Idrovolanti Alta Italia). In 1922 Marchettí joined Savoia to form one of the great aircraft companies in history, until merged in 1983. After the conclusion of the Schneider Trophy race (won by UK), the firm used its experience to build fast aircraft for civilian and military use.

You probably saw the very similar looking Italian S.81 in game, which was a militarized version of the successful S.73. The S.M.79 was new passenger version based on the planform of its predecessor; the most obvious difference was retractable landing gear. It was truly made first as a passenger version to compete with those being made by other countries. Needless to say, it immediately attracted attention of the Regina Italia and a bomber version was developed in parallel. For a few brief months it was considered the best transport and bomber in world and became a major point of pride in Fascist Italy and was sold to several countries in the years before WW2.

Unlike nearly every bomber in War Thunder (and even in WW2), it was built mainly of steel a wood! The fuselage was a common for time welded steel tube design, with entire rear half being covered in cloth and plywood. The crew area to nose was duralumin cladded (which is very similar to Hawker Hurricane’s construction). Most surprising the wings are completely wood! A major technical achievement for its size. During its production life several engines where tried, depending on power and reliability, one model even removing the nose engine.

To make the S.M.79 fast the wings are shorter than typical for its weight. To compensate for higher clean stall speed a number of advanced high lift devices were used to reduce stall speed for landing, being Handley-Page leading extending slats and drooping ailerons (also called “flaperons”) in conjunction with uncommon slotted flaps. After trying a few engines, the Alfa Romeo 126 was used on the prototypes for testing and the record breaking flights soon after. As with the S.M.73 / S.81, once again the Italian military wanted a bomber version and laid out proposed additions.

''Sparviero goes to war''

''The spacious cabin was easy to install a set of bomb racks, all bombs mounted vertically (not unusual for time). While the S.81 had the bomb aimers position just behind the nose-mounted engine, the S.M.79 positioned it in a ventral “tub” well after of the bomb bay itself. Also unlike the S.81 this streamlined tub also became the location of the ventral defensive gun, usually a 12.7 mm Breda-SAFT MG instead of a turret. A streamlined dorsal mount was also installed for a rear firing 12.7 mm MG, and unusually for bombers a fixed, pilot fired forward mounted 12.7 mm MG, firing above the propeller disk. Both these streamlined protrusions could be closed to greatly minimize drag for a very high cruise speed, which the turreted S.81 could not. It was the prominent hump on its top that earned the nickname "il gobbo maledetto" ("damned hunchback"). Italy was open to export sales, and many countries purchased this top of line bomber to add to their forces.''

''From the high of the Spanish Civil War to the end of WW2, the Sparviero was the backbone of Italian bomber air forces and continued to do well over the vast stretches of the Mediterranean sea despite better allied defenses. Success was made despite high losses up to the Italian Armistice. They continued to be used in lesser roles on both sides of the conflict, and after the war were used for various duties by several nations for years later. Lebanon was the last operator who used them well in the 1950’s and are the last 2 remaining S.M.79 in world.''
