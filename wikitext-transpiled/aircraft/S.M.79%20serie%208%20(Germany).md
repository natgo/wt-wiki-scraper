== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27 in the German aviation tree. In [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]], the S.M.79, as well as the other Italian planes in the German tree, were moved to the new Italian tree.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Due to its relatively low battle rating, the three-engined S.M.79 enjoys a relatively high speed for a bomber against most of the lower ranked opposition it faces. This aids its survivability, particularly in a shallow dive. Unfortunately, it is rather lacking in bombload options compared to the He 111s and Ju 88s and also has rather poor defensive fire arcs. Unlike the German bombers, however, it is armed with 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns which can pack quite a punch against the flimsier aircraft it faces. The pilot also controls a fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which is otherwise uncovered by any defensive armament. This gun can be useful for strafing light vehicles and trucks that will be encountered frequently in low-rank battles and can be used to shoot down other aircraft. It is somewhat more manoeuvrable than the He 111 H-3, but the Sparviero is by no means a fighter and will rapidly lose energy in turns. With the ability to carry 500 kg bombs, the S.M.79 can use these to more easily take out pillboxes and heavier tanks, although this reduces the total bombload to only 1,000 kg as opposed to 1,250 kg with 250 kg bombs.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Hard-hitting 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT defensive machine guns
* Pilot-controlled fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which can be equipped with IAI (explosive) ammunition
* High speed
* Middle engine provides some level of protection for the pilot against head-on attacks
* Capable of carrying 500 kg bombs, unlike the He 111 H-3 or Do 17 Z-1

'''Cons:'''

* Poor total bomb load
* Poor defensive fire arcs, including a dead zone in the rear where neither of the rearward facing 12.7 mm machine guns can cover
* No frontal defensive gun covering the frontal aspect
* Lacks armour protection for the crew
* Forced to choose between less total bomb load but individually more powerful bombs or higher total bomb load with less powerful bombs

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

Three-engine SIAI Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 "Sparviero" medium bomber, issued 1939.

The S.M.79 gradually became the Regia Aeronautica's main strike plane. In 1938, five regiments were re-equipped. That same year, about 150 "Sparviero" aircraft were in service in Italy. A year later, over 300 were in service.

Besides taking part in the Spanish Civil War, the S.M.79 was used for landing troops during the invasion of Albania in 1939, as well as in Italy's attack on Greece.

In 1939, AUSA factories started releasing S.M.79s. This series was practically unchanged from its predecessor, except that the exhaust pipe of the right engine was moved to the outside of the nacelle so that smoke from the pipe would not contact the fuselage.

When on June 10, 1940, Italy entered the Second World War, the Italian Air Force possessed 612 S.M.79s in 14 regiments and one special group, distributed throughout the mainland and the colonies (the "Sparviero" appeared in Libya in 1939). During this period, two-thirds of all Italian bombers were S.M.79s.

In addition to the combat regiments, the "Sparviero" had its own flying school. Also, about a dozen S.M.79TPs (with rectangular windows and 5-6 seats in place of the bomb bay) were used as personal transport aircraft for high-ranking officers.

During the fighting, S.M.79s were used day and night, attacking targets in Malta, Tunisia, France, Aden, and in North and East Africa.

In North Africa, in September 1940, four regiments of S.M.79s supported the Italian attack on Egypt. The "Sparviero" was even tested as a ground attack aircraft to support troops in the field and hunt for British tanks and armoured cars, but high losses quickly put an end to these activities.

On the front, some of the S.M.79's shortcomings were painfully obvious. Its weak guns were located in primitive turrets which limited their field of fire, and the machine guns' characteristics were unsatisfactory (particularly their rate of fire). This, plus weak armour and lack of self-sealing fuel tanks, sharply reduced the aircraft's combat value. The huge one-piece wing was difficult to repair in the field. The aircraft's speed no longer protected it from the latest fighters; the "Sparviero" was already out of date.
