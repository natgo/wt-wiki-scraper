== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]], though a [[S.M.79_serie_8_(Germany)|variant]] existed in the [[:Category:Germany_aircraft|German aircraft tech tree]] prior to the update. The only readily apparent difference between the serie 8 and the [[S.M.79 serie 1]] is the ability to activate WEP, as well as an improved dorsal turret allowing for a slightly higher vertical firing arc.

The S.M.79 serie 8 is an interesting aircraft to fly - it has a decent amount of survivability and defensive armament, but carries less bombs than its peers.

'''Air battles:'''

In air battles, the S.M.79 should be used as a traditional base bomber - it is decent at this role, being able to take out at least one base using its bomb load. At the start of the map, run straight for the bases. There is no need to climb, as most fighters at this BR will struggle to climb to the S.M.79's altitude. When arriving at the base, switch to the bomb sight and drop your bomb load - the 250 kg bombs are the most effective against bases, as three will be enough for a base. The 500 kg bombs cannot always kill a base in one shot, meaning that the 250 kg bombs are usually the better option. Once you've dropped your load, head back to base and grab some more; the S.M.79 is very ineffective without its payload.

In the case that you are being pursued by an enemy fighter, do not fear! The S.M.79 has a decent defensive armament for its BR. You have access to two 12.7 mm Breda machine guns, one dorsal and one ventral, as well as two beam-mounted 7.7 mm Lewis guns. The 12.7 mm guns are quite effective and can easily take out an engine or pilot-snipe. Thus, when being pursued, bait the enemy onto your six, and fire at them with the Breda guns. Don't attempt to outmanoeuvre any fighters - it will never happen, given the S.M.79's poor manoeuvrability. As well, the S.M.79 is quite fast for a bomber and can even outrun some fighters! When being shot at, diving away is another great option.

'''Ground battles:'''

The S.M.79 is a great early ground-pounder for ground battles, being equipped with a large amount of bombs. In this playstyle, the GP 500 bombs are by far the most effective, as they pack a large amount of explosives and can easily take out a cluster of tanks at a choke point - a capture point, for example. When attacking, approach low (don't forget to set a bomb fuse delay), drop, and pull out. As well, beware of any enemy SPAAs as they can tear the S.M.79's fuselage apart - thus, staying low when flying back to base is a good option, as it keeps the S.M.79 out of the range of enemy SPAAs. Against enemy fighters, use the tactics listed above - the S.M.79 is quite effective at its BR in terms of defensive armament.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Hard-hitting 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT defensive machine guns.
* Pilot-controlled fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which can be equipped with IAI (explosive) ammunition.
* Good speed.
* Middle engine provides some level of protection for the pilot against head-on attacks.
* Capable of carrying 500 kg bombs, unlike the [[He 111 H-3]] or [[Do 17 Z-2]].

'''Cons:'''

* Very limited bomb payload compared to the He 111 H-3 which has 1,250 kg max.
* Poor defensive fire arcs, including a dead-zone in the rear where neither of the rearward facing 12.7 mm machine guns can cover.
* No frontal defensive gun covering the frontal aspect.
* Lacks armour protection for the crew.
* Forced to choose between less total bomb payload, but individually more powerful bombs or higher total bomb payload with less powerful bombs.

Alessandro Marchettí was famous for creating record breaking and Schneider Trophy winning racing seaplanes, and was the Savoia (aka SIAI, Società Idrovolanti Alta Italia). In 1922 Marchettí joined Savoia to form one of the great aircraft companies in history, until merged in 1983. After the conclusion of the Schneider Trophy race (won by UK), the firm used its experience to build fast aircraft for civilian and military use.

You probably saw the very similar looking Italian S.81 in game, which was a militarized version of the successful S.73. The S.M.79 was new passenger version based on the planform of its predecessor; the most obvious difference was retractable landing gear. It was truly made first as a passenger version to compete with those being made by other countries. Needless to say, it immediately attracted attention of the Regina Italia and a bomber version was developed in parallel. For a few brief months it was considered the best transport and bomber in world and became a major point of pride in Fascist Italy and was sold to several countries in the years before WW2.

Unlike nearly every bomber in War Thunder (and even in WW2), it was built mainly of steel a wood! The fuselage was a common for time welded steel tube design, with entire rear half being covered in cloth and plywood. The crew area to nose was duralumin-clad (which is very similar to Hawker Hurricane's construction). Most surprising the wings are completely wood! A major technical achievement for its size. During its production life several engines where tried, depending on power and reliability, one model even removing the nose engine.

To make the S.M.79 fast the wings are shorter than typical for its weight. To compensate for higher clean stall speed a number of advanced high lift devices were used to reduce stall speed for landing, being Handley-Page leading extending slats and drooping ailerons (also called "flaperons") in conjunction with uncommon slotted flaps. After trying a few engines, the Alfa Romeo 126 was used on the prototypes for testing and the record breaking flights soon after. As with the S.M.73/S.81, once again the Italian military wanted a bomber version and laid out proposed additions.

'''Sparviero goes to war'''

The spacious cabin was easy to install a set of bomb racks, all bombs mounted vertically (not unusual for time). While the S.81 had the bomb aimers position just behind the nose-mounted engine, the S.M.79 positioned it in a ventral "tub" well after of the bomb bay itself. Also unlike the S.81 this streamlined tub also became the location of the ventral defensive gun, usually a 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT MG instead of a turret. A streamlined dorsal mount was also installed for a rear firing 12.7 mm MG, and unusually for bombers a fixed, pilot fired forward mounted 12.7 mm MG, firing above the propeller disk. Both these streamlined protrusions could be closed to greatly minimize drag for a very high cruise speed, which the turreted S.81 could not. It was the prominent hump on its top that earned the nickname il gobbo maledetto ("damned hunchback"). Italy was open to export sales, and many countries purchased this top of line bomber to add to their forces.

From the high of the Spanish Civil War to the end of WW2, the Sparviero was the backbone of Italian bomber air forces and continued to do well over the vast stretches of the Mediterranean sea despite better allied defences. Success was made despite high losses up to the Italian Armistice. They continued to be used in lesser roles on both sides of the conflict, and after the war were used for various duties by several nations for years later. Lebanon was the last operator who used them well into the 1950s and are the last 2 remaining S.M.79 in world.
