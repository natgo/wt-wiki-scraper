== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The S.O.4050 Vautour IIA is the fastest accelerating, climbing and diving subsonic plane in the entire game. The acceleration of the aircraft is ridiculous, coupled with the insane climb rate and diving capabilities makes the S.O.4050 IIA a very powerful aircraft.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 30 mm DEFA 551 cannons, nose-mounted (100 rpg = 400 total)

The four machine guns are arranged in bundles of two mounted in the nose of the fuselage. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The S.O.4050 Vautour IIA should be used like the [[Hunter F.1|Hunter]], but more aggressively. Always load 8 minutes of fuel, use the bomber spawn to spawn at 3,000 meters, rush to a base, drop your bombs then rush to the enemy airfield to catch enemies off-guard. Besides catching enemies off-guard, the Vautour IIA can cause the enemy team to panic by rushing - when enemy players see a Vautour going faster than 1,000 km/h and they're a lot slower - they tend to panic, causing them to scatter around to find space in order to gain speed which could possibly ruin teamwork.
Do '''NOT''' turn. The Vautour is very bad at turning and rolling, it should be used as an exclusive boom and zoomer - like the Hunter. Gain speed, engage, zoom up, loop around, dive, rinse and repeat. The Vautour has excellent energy retention characteristics.

In a downtier, jets such as the [[CL-13A Mk 5|CL-13]], [[MiG-15bis]], [[MiG-17]] etc should be your main concern. They turn and roll better than the SO.4050 does. While you can outrun the MiG-15s at sea level, you cannot run away from the MiG-17 and the CL-13 as their top speeds are higher (MiG-17: 1,121 km/h, CL-13: 1,114 km/h). Despite that fact, the Vautour outclasses them in climb rate, energy retention and acceleration. The [[Me 163 B]] and [[G.91 R/1|G.91]] are also no match for the plane's speed.

However, with the advent of air-to-air missiles, the Vautour's lack of manoeuvrability becomes a crucial weakspot. The maximum overload of +6G is often insufficient to evade missiles, especially when attempting to do so at high speed. As such, the Vautour is an incredibly easy for even an [[AIM-9B Sidewinder|AIM-9B]] Sidewinder. In addition, the introduction of powerful, high-climbing jets like the [[AV-8C]] and [[Harrier GR.1]], mean that it is now impossible to exploit the Vautour's climb rate to your advantage. These factors coincide to make the Vautour hard to play when uptiered, and as such, a more passive playstyle is recommended. When uptiered, you can either attempt to rush and force head-ons with enemy players, or you can wait for the enemy team to engage friendly fighters before bombing the bases.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent payload options, enough to destroy all 3 minibases (4 x 750 on the first base, 3 x 750 on the other two).
* Insane acceleration.
* High top speed, outruns many aircraft at its battle rating.
* Climbs exceptionally well without ordnance.
* Energy retention is great.
* Bomber spawn (3,000 - 3,500 meters).
* Extremely versatile (can be used in a variety of roles).
* Armoured cockpit, easier to survive head-on engagements.

'''Cons:'''

* Ammo consumption is too high to engage multiple targets.
* Compresses at high speed (similar to that of the MiG-15s' and MiG-17's infamous compression).
* No bomb sight unlike the earlier [[S.O.4050 Vautour IIB]].
* Massive penalties in flight performance when carrying ordnance.
* Bad manoeuvrability, making it hard to dodge missiles.
* Roll rate is unimpressive.
* Fragile engines; a hit to an engine will massively decrease top speed.
* Relies heavily on team support.
* Massive target.
* Wings tend to rip with payload on the wings above 850 km/h, or when pulling high-G manoeuvres.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In total 140 of the versatile and powerful Vautour aircraft were built by France between 1956 and 1959. The Vautour II-A was the ground attack variant; the II-B the bomber; and the II-N an all-weather interceptor. The first two variants saw greater service with the Israelis, whereas the interceptor was used by the French. All variants were still in use into the 1970s.

The II-N prototype, with two crew, had made its first flight in October, 1952, followed by the single-seat II-A in December, 1953. After nine prototypes, the French made an initial order for 440 aircraft, including 300 II-As. However, only 30 of the II-A would be completed, with the first entering service in 1956. In 1960, all II-A and the 40 II-B (the two-seater bomber model) that had been produced were taken out of French service and sold to Israel.
