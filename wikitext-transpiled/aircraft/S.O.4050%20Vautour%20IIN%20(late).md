== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Vautour IIN boasts a top speed of just under Mach 1 and adequate acceleration. On the other side, it has very poor manoeuvrability in its BR range, right behind the [[Tu-4]]. Neither of its two possible loadouts noticeably affects flight performance.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
Despite its size, the Vautour will quickly break down if it gets shot at. The pilot is prone to get knocked out easily as well.

{{main|DEFA 552 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 30 mm DEFA 552 cannons, nose-mounted (100 rpg = 400 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AA-20 Nord|Matra R511}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance presets:

* Without load
* 4 x AA-20 Nord missiles
* 4 x Matra R511 missiles

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Vautour II N is an interceptor, and for the most part, can only be played as such. Due to its very poor manoeuvrability, attempting to turn fight is akin to suicide. The Vautour is best at keeping its top speed and using tried and true boom and zoom tactics. There are too few bombers at the Vautour's BR, thus its best opportunity is head-on engagements. Both of the Vautour's loadouts are worthwhile in that role, the 4 x AA-20 Nord missiles may be manually-guided missiles, but they do not require mastery of manual guidance or even the usage of it to be worthwhile, they are proximity-fuze and are a perfect surprise head-on weapon. Launching 2 of them at the 2 km threshold can be particularly effective.

Meanwhile, the 4 x radar-guided Matra R511 missiles are not particularly reliable but can be launched as soon as passing the 8 km threshold, and can be quite effective against the occasional bomber.

There are several big threats to the Vautour, take care around the [[Sea Vixen F.A.W. Mk.2]], while the Vautour cannot really dodge missiles, it can often outrun them, but this does not apply to the Sea Vixen as it is faster than the Vautour and will eventually catch up.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has great acceleration and good top speed
* Able to mix the loadouts of AA-20 Nord and R.511 missiles
* The AA-20 Nords are very useful and reliable in head-ons thanks to the great proxy fuse and warhead, and the R.511 in most situations as the Vautour is able to lock by radar
* Excellent quadruple 30 mm cannons with good ammo capacity and insane damage
* R.511 has excellent manoeuvrability for an early radar-guided missile, and also the radar has much less ground interference compared to its contemporaries

'''Cons:'''

* Although manoeuvrable, the R.511 is one of the slowest missiles in the game, it is not able to catch enemies with considerable speed in a tail chase
* The R.511 produces a pretty visible smoke from kilometres away, and many planes can see and evade pretty easily
* Incredibly poor manoeuvrability in any manoeuvre and speed
* Entirely lacks air-to-ground options, making it a one-dimensional vehicle.
* the AA-20 Nord missiles are MCLOS, needing specific keybinds and full manual guidance by the pilot in certain situations, not beginner-friendly
