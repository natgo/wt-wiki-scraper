The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5008-news-french-aircraft-in-update-1-73-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6170-special-victory-day-en|2019 Victory Day Sale]], but was later reintroduced for the [[wt:en/news/6694-shop-may-sale-in-war-thunder-en|2020 May Sale]] purchasable in-game for Golden Eagles {{ge}}.

The Narval (French for Narwhal) is designed to be an interceptor, and it excels in this role with a good climb rate, interceptor spawn, high speed and 6 powerful cannons.

Underneath the sleek and eye-pleasing design of the Narval lies a monster of a plane when piloted well. It wields an extremely powerful sextet of the previously mentioned cannons, which happen to be the German MG 151s, wielding the dreaded Minengeschoß ammunition round which gives ballistics similar to most 37 mm cannons while keeping the various upsides of 20 mm cannons (light weight, high muzzle velocity and universal use) allowing you to shred bombers in a few well aimed bursts.

However, the plane is not without its weaknesses. The rear mounted engine and propeller makes it easy for the engine to get knocked out when being tailed. It also has a particularly poor turn rate, so turning versus most planes is a death sentence, as it will make it easy for an opponent to snipe your pilot.

Having 6 cannons means that you are completely defenceless after running out of ammo in them, with no extra machine guns to defend yourself with (though with 250 rounds per cannon and 6 cannons, you shouldn't run out of ammo easily).

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 6 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, nose-mounted (250 rpg = 1,500 total)

The six cannons are arranged in bundles of three, each of which is cheek-mounted towards the underside of the fuselage. Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire with each other until empty.

=== Suspended armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M65A1 Fin M129 (1,000 lb)|T10 140|T10 151}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 Fin M129 bombs (2,000 lb total)
* 8 x T10 140 rockets
* 8 x T10 151 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Narval has a very distinguished silhouette, almost looking like a cross between a P-38 lightning and a Me 163 Komet. The first thing you will notice is the interestingly designed pair of wings. The inboard leading edge of its wing was sweptback 24 degrees, while the outboard section was sweptback 13.5 degrees and incorporated a dihedral angle. The superb roll rate was achieved with a combination of small ailerons at the tip of the wings and spoilers along with clipped wings which only slightly reduced the plane's turning capability. It also wears large double slotted flaps designed to decrease speed for carrier operations.

The powerful Arsenal 12H (which was a copy of the Junkers Jumo 213) allows the plane to get to a very high top speed at around 8,000 m and gives it brutal speed in a dive.

The plane is also made entirely out of metal, which allows it to take some punishment from enemy fighters.

The Narval is an exceptional interceptor, however due to its ability to mount either 2 x 1,000 lb bombs or 8 x T10 151 AP rockets, it can also make an effective strike fighter.

If going the interceptor route, you must climb to a high altitude in order to not only attack bombers, but make the most out of the 12H, where it performs the best.

On the flip side, if you are going for the strike fighter role, be aware that mounting rockets and bombs will throw the centre of gravity back, which worsens the already bad turn rate.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very strong forward armament (6 x 20 mm MG 151s)
* Plenty of ammo
* Very high rip rate for a prop aircraft
* Solid roll rate
* 50 mm sloped bulletproof glass
* The heavy weight gives it brutal acceleration in a dive at altitude and decent energy retention
* Engine located at the back makes it less likely to be knocked out by bomber/attacker gunners or in a head-on attack
* Gets an interceptor spawn, which allows gives it an opportunity to climb well above its opponents
* Good visibility in the cockpit
* All guns are mounted in the aircraft's nose, making them accurate and having little to no convergence

'''Cons:'''

* During takeoff, pulling on the stick too early will damage the tail
* Feels sluggish at low speeds due to the massive weight
* Takes a bit of time to accelerate
* Climbs rather slowly, even with air spawn, so enemies may still be able to out-climb the Narval
* Poor turn-rate
* Rather fragile wings
* Wing sweep means that when you carry bombs, the centre of mass is thrown way back, affecting the already poor turn-rate

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Narval was a prototype twin-boom pusher Naval Fighter prototype created by Sud-Ouest (or SNCASO) during the late 1940s. It was to be powered by an Arsenal 12H02 V-12 which was a French postwar development of the Junkers Jumo 213 that famously powered the FW 190D series. The 12H would make a max 2,250 Hp that would power contra-rotating pusher propellers and could propel the Narval to 730 km/h (454 mph) at 8,000 m. The Narval also would've been armed with 6 x 20 mm cannons mounted vertically on the cheeks, with 3 on each cheek and hard points that could mount 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of ordnance were placed under the wings. Because the 12H02 was tuned for high altitudes and had a turbo-supercharger, it likely would've been used as a High Altitude Bomber Interceptor, but due to the hard points, it could've also been used as a Strike Fighter, which gives it a similar role to the famed Republic P-47 Thunderbolt; a Strike Fighter/Interceptor.

However, only two prototypes were created, and the development of the Narval was abandoned by 1950 since the design was already obsolescent due to the advancements in jet engine technology. Even if SNASCO had continued development for the Narval, it is likely that it wouldn't have been accepted due to the cost of producing the plane, the massive weight (7 tonnes!) and the unorthodox design.
