== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Swedish reconnaissance dive-bomber aircraft designed by SAAB. The land-based SAAB 17 was the first all-metal stressed-skin aircraft developed in Sweden, introduced in 1940. The SAAB 17BS was the latest version of the B17, based on the [[B17B]], it was designed for reconnaissance and it featured photographic equipment, it replaced the landing gear with floats and the original engine by a Bristol Mercury XXIV engine; 38 units were built.

It was introduced in [[Update "Raining Fire"]]. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a slow and sluggish bomber. It has access to 2 x forward mounting machine guns, which are an adequate armament for its BR. It is more capable at ground attack however, with access to 9 x 50 kg bombs. It has also access to a bomb sight, which means that dropping bombs with precision shouldn't be an issue. In air battles, the bombs are particularly useful against light fortifications and vehicle columns.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 10 mm Steel plate in pilot's seat
* 10 mm Steel plate in front of gunner*
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (4 in each wing)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Note that the gunner is rear-facing

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

As the S17BS is a relatively simple aircraft, the progress of obtaining its modifications is also quite simple. One recommended order of research is as follows:

* Offensive 8 mm: researching this modification can allow the player to choose between different ammunition belts, including Armored Targets belts which will increase the amount of armour-piercing rounds present in the belt, over the Default ammunition. Stealth belts can also be used, which can allow the machine guns to fire ammunition that does not contain tracer rounds. Players can use these to attack ground targets or unsuspecting enemy aircraft.
* Airframe: this modification will increase the aircraft's durability, giving it a higher chance to return to the airfield even if damaged.
* Turret 8 mm: this modification is very similar to the previous modification and will give the player access to other ammunition belt types. It is recommended to take Armored Targets belts for increased damage against aircraft with armour or solid structures.
* Flight Performance modifications: the S17BS is relatively slow and sluggish. These modifications will help to remedy this issue by increasing its performance. As with all modifications, players can hover over each modification to see exactly how they will affect the vehicle when equipped.
* Cover: this modification will both improve the aircraft's performance and durability.
* New 8 mm MGs and New 8 mm MGs (turret): equipping these modifications will improve the aircraft's weaponry for increased reliability and accuracy.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Ksp m/22 Fh (8 mm)|Ksp m/22 Fv (8 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 8 mm Ksp m/22 Fh machine gun, wing-mounted (500 rpg)
* 1 x 8 mm Ksp m/22 Fv machine gun, wing-mounted (500 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|sb m/42 (50 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 9 x 50 kg sb m/42 bombs (450 kg total)

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Ksp m/22-37 R (8 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 8 mm Ksp m/22-37 R machine gun, dorsal turret (300 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The B17BS is fitted with two forward facing machine guns, allowing players to dispatch lightly-armoured ground targets and lone enemy aircraft. With the option to load 9 x 50 kg bombs, the B17BS becomes a potent ground attacker for its battle rating. The pilot should not rely on this plane's sluggish manoeuvrability and low maximum speed. Unlike faster and more potently armed planes, this aircraft is often played methodically, away from the centre of the battlefield. In Arcade battles, the bombsight allows for liberal aiming at specific targets, ideally columns of lightly-armoured vehicles. Having a bombsight means you can stay at relatively high altitudes without endangering yourself. 

Should an enemy attempt to attack you, you can dive away in order to gain speed for an escape. The S17BS's firepower is adequate but not excellent, meaning head-on attacks can be dangerous. If the enemy is attacking from the rear, players can utilize the rear gunner. This gunner may be able to deter or destroy enemy fighters, especially if they are biplanes which are often unarmoured. If the enemy aircraft presses the attack, you can evade shots by wiggling the aircraft around in order to throw off their aim. The S17BS has a sturdy enough construction to resist rifle-calibre rounds and can even withstand a few 20 mm cannon rounds. 

Overall, the plane is a serviceable light attacker.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Relatively durable against light machine guns
* Can land and float on water
* 9 x 50 kg sb m/42 bombs for bombing ground targets
* Bombsight can increase bombing accuracy

'''Cons:'''

* Slow and large target profile
* Poor manoeuvrability
* Can only carry small bombs 
* Very light defensive armament with limited firing angles
* Floats create more drag, making the B-17BS slower than the [[B17B]] and the [[B17A]]
