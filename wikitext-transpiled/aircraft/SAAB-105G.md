== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Swedish twin engine jet trainer that could also serve in a role of light attack and reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft itself entered service in 1967 to replace the ageing fleet of de Havilland Vampires used until then. The SAAB-105G was a modification of the SAAB-105XT export demonstrator of the SK 60B powered by General Electric J85 turbojets instead of the Turbomeca Aubisque, and featuring new avionics, precision navigation/attack system, and modified wing. One example was built.

Introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]], the SAAB-105G is similar to the [[SAAB-105OE]]. The main difference between the two is in the suspended armament, where the SAAB-105G is able to carry various free-fall bombs and unguided rockets, while the SAAB-105OE is able to carry Rb05A MCLOS missiles and unable to carry bombs. In terms of flying characteristics, the plane is quite manoeuvrable, although not very fast with poor acceleration due to its turbofan engines.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

There is no armour on the SAAB-105G; the internal modules of the aircraft are fairly spaced out with engines far apart in the rear fuselage and fuel tanks taking up all of the wings and a portion of the forward fuselage. Beware of any wing damage when carrying heavy bomb loads as there is already a lot of strain on them, and they may overload sooner than you would expect.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The SAAB-105G is a very flexible multi-role aircraft, best used in the interceptor role at the beginning of an air match, then changing armament mid-match depending on the situation. Thanks to its airspawn and 2 x [[RB24]] (Swedish [[AIM-9B]]) missiles, you can hunt down enemy bombers and heavy attackers before returning to base. Beware as these missiles have very poor tracking on targets doing anything more than flying in a straight line, so are best used on enemies who are too slow to manoeuvre or are otherwise unaware of your presence. Once you have spent the 2 missiles or there are no viable targets to use them on, you will need to return to base to rearm.

On your second take-off, you should consider if your team needs more air power to shoot down fighters, or if you can spend the time to bomb bases or attack ground units. The SAAB-105G gets two wing mounted 30 mm cannons, the same as on the previous SK60B, and performs similarly in a dogfight to that plane; you want to use your massive firepower and very stable turning characteristics to force enemies into turn fights. Be aware of your surroundings though, as the aircraft accelerates fairly slowly after manoeuvring and can make an easy target for far faster aircraft.

For ground attack, you have a very wide range of high performance weapons to choose from. All bombs and rockets have access to a bombing computer, making accurate attacks extremely easy, and the 30 mm gun pods have enough firepower to destroy light pillboxes and medium tanks in a short burst.

As a CAS aircraft in Ground RB you need to be aware of the airspace conditions before selecting your loadout. You are limited to 2 x 2 drops of any kind of bomb, but can only take the gun pods for dealing with air threats with the weaker 500 lb bombs. All bomb loads get access to the RB24 missiles as well, but the added weight is rarely worth taking due to the unreliability of the missiles. Thanks to the bombing computer though, landing even the 500 lb bombs within the 8 m vehicle destruction radius is very easy so long as the targets are not moving too quickly.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Airspawn in air RB
* Excellent guns
* Extremely early in BR access to air-to-air missiles in the RB24, ideal for scoring kills on Tu-4s, IL-28s, B-57s and other unaware or slow enemies
* Wide variety of ground attack ordnance, including a heavy load of bombs with AAMs
* Access to customizable loadouts for secondary weapons, allowing a vide variety of roles from air interdiction to ground attack
* Access to bombing computer, making accurate bombing runs even with low yield bombs very rewarding
* Decent turning ability making for a capable dogfighter
* Good airbrake and tricycle landing gear makes landing easy

'''Cons:'''

* Below average acceleration, loses speed in vertical manoeuvres rapidly
* Engines run very hot at 100% throttle under 2,500 m, can be offset by setting to 98% throttle however
* RB24 missiles are very unreliable on targets with any turning ability
* Heavier bomb/AAM loads put massive strain on the wings, flying at high speed or making any sharp turns can rip the wings off very suddenly
* Stiff elevator handling at high speed, hard to pull off from a high-speed dive
* Thrust reversal not available unlike on the SK60
