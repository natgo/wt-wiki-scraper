== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Saab 105OE''' was an improved version of the Saab 105XT export demonstrator prototype designed for the Austrian Air Force, which itself was an improved version of the [[SK60B|Sk 60B]] with General Electric J85 turbojets instead of the Turbomeca Aubisque used in the Sk 60. The first Austrian Saab 105OE was delivered in July 1970 where they replaced the Saab 29 Tunnan and de Havilland Vampire. Austria received 40 aircraft in total, and they were finally retired after 50 years of service on 31st December 2020.

Introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]], the Saab 105OE is a variant of the Saab 105G found in the Swedish tech tree, though representing its service with the Austrian Air Force. The main difference between the two aircraft however is the modified wing found on the 105G, as well as a slightly more powerful variant of the GE J85 engines. Unlike the Saab 105G, the Austrian version also does not have access to any bombs, this is offset by the ability to mount Rb05A missiles. This ability is missing on the Saab 105G. In terms of flying characteristics, the plane is quite manoeuvrable, although not very fast with poor acceleration due to its turbofan engines.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

There is no armour on the SAAB-105ÖE; the internal modules of the aircraft are fairly spaced out with engines far apart in the rear fuselage and fuel tanks taking up all of the wings and a portion of the forward fuselage.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely powerful weaponry
* Can carry both cannon pods and [[RB24]] missiles, or [[Rb05A]] missiles and RB24 missiles at the same time

'''Cons:'''

* Fairly poor acceleration
* Does not turn very well
* No armour and exposed pilots
* No integrated offensive armament, requiring gunpods
