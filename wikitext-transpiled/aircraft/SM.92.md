== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

The {{PAGENAME}} is an Italian twin-engine fighter/bomber prototype designed and produced in 1943. It utilized two imported German Daimler-Benz 605 engines. It was designed to have better performance than its predecessor, the SM.91. The middle gondola was eliminated and the cockpit for the crew of two, the pilot and the gunner, was moved behind the left engine. The gunner remotely operated a fixed 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine gun located in the aircraft's tail.

The {{PAGENAME}} had an armament complement of three 20 mm MG 151 autocannons and four 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns.

In-game this plane can reach over 16 m/s in climb rate and with its air spawn, that is enough to get a sufficient altitude above most fighters once the engagements start.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The SM.92 has a better performance than its predecessor, despite the engines staying the same. It has been made much more aerodynamic with the removal of the gondola on the SM.91 and the moving of the crew to the left fuselage, behind one of the 2 powerful Daimler-Benz 605A1 engines. Part of this improvement is also due to the change on the defensive armament, changing from a 20 mm cannon with a decent traverse to an aerodynamically mounted fixed 12.7 mm Breda-Safat

This plane also has leading edge slats, which help it on its roll rate (as they get deployed on one wing when doing a roll manoeuvre) and its low speed performance.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The SM.92 has average manoeuvrability, good armament and good suspended armament, the 4 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT and 3x 20 mm MG151 are very good to destroy the enemy planes by burning them, destroying parts of the enemy planes and knocking out the enemy pilot, the position of armament differs from its predecessor, the [[SM.91]].

Most enemy planes can be destroyed with a head-on and Boom and zoom attacks. Your guns you can destroy every aircraft at your BR. In Ground RB the situation is different because there are some tanks that you can't penetrate so you need to use your suspended armament, the best payload is 2x 500 kg bombs but a downside is that you drop all bombs at once. You can use the SM.92 in pretty much any role you want, here under are some tactics that can be used in battles. At start of the battle, always climb at either 10° (stock) or 12,5° (upgraded) with WEP until 2,000 m and then chose the most suitable tactics depending on the scenario:

;Ground attack

In Air RB, focus on the enemy light casemates, AA and artillery with your guns and destroy enemy light tanks and pillboxes with your bombs.

;CAS (Close Air Support)

In Ground RB and Naval RB, you can do dive attacks or sea level attacks on ships behind cover

For a dive attack, climb  to the altitude of 2,000 m, dive to increase your speed and drop the bombs to the enemy ground vehicles, use 1,5 secs of time fuse. In Naval RB, use Assault fuse and drop the bomb to the enemy ships at circa 300-400 m so you can escape from the enemy AA and your explosion blast wave. After you've spent the bombs, you can destroy little ships and armoured boats with your guns.

For a hedgehopping attack, approach enemy ground vehicles sideways and drop the bombs, the attack is more accurate as you drop altitude but when you do, enemy AA vehicles can kill you more easily. In naval RB, use the 1,5 secs fuse so you can bounce the bomb in water and hit the target precisely. After you dropped the bombs you can use the [[SM.92]] as a interceptor and take down enemy planes, so you can protect your team by achieving an air superiority.

;Interceptor

After you climbed at 3,000 m, chase enemy bombers: attack them frontally or from. If there are enemy fighters under you, do a boom and zoom attack on them, you can use combat flaps for more manoeuvrability. But your flaps have a rip speed of 535 km/h so don't destroy them or you'll lose speed and manoeuvrability. There are some enemy fighters that you can't easily kill easily because are very manoeuvrable and will evade your BnZ attacks (for example "Zeros" A6M2/A6M5 and Spitfires). In that case, use your attacks as deterrent to prevent them from reaching your altitude.

'''Pros:'''

* Potent offensive armament with huge ammo count
* Great for Head-on and Boom and zoom attacks
* Can be used as interceptor
* Gets an attacker spawn (AB/RB)
* Good diving manoeuvrability
* Good turn rate

'''Cons:'''

* Poor gun convergence due to gun placements resulting into poor accuracy while turning
* Defensive turret is almost fixed (only ±2° in each direction); the target has to be at exactly 6 o'clock to be engaged
* Poor acceleration even when diving
* Big target for AA and fighters
* The pilot and gunner are in the same place so they can be knocked out easily
* Carrying the largest payload has a noticeable effect on performance
* Wings are littered with fuel tanks
* Tail is prone to snapping when shot at

[[File:Savoia Marchetti S.M.92.jpg|thumb|450x450px|Front view of the sole Savoia-Marchetti SM.92 prototype.]]
The Savoia-Marchetti SM.92 was an Italian prototype heavy fighter/bomber aircraft developed during the Second World War. Based on the previous SM.88 prototype heavy fighter, the aircraft featured a dual-boom design with two engines and two crew members both in a single cockpit. Like its predecessor, only a single prototype was built; this aircraft was tested but later damaged when an Axis fighter pilot mistook it for the similarly-shaped American P-38 Lightning. After being grounded for repairs, the single aircraft was destroyed by Allied bombing, thus ending the life of this unique Italian heavy fighter.

=== Design and development ===
In 1939, the Italian aircraft firm Savoia-Marchetti produced the SM.88 fighter - this was a prototype heavy fighter aircraft with twin booms, two engines and a crew nacelle nestled in between the booms. Despite being quite successful in tests, the project was abandoned due to the introduction of the German Bf 110, a heavy fighter with similar performance. However, in 1942, Savoia-Marchetti began the development of a new heavy twin-boom heavy fighter aircraft, similar to the SM.88 - this would ultimately become the SM.92.

The SM.92 was developed at the same time as the earlier [[SM.91]] heavy fighter, enabling the use of common components for both aircraft. The aircraft featured a twin boom design, meaning that there were two separate fuselages on the aircraft, one on each side. For simplicity, the SM.92 utilized the fuselage booms, tailplane and wing structure of the SM.91. However, the aircraft had just a single cockpit mounted asymmetrically on the portside or left fuselage. The two crew members consisted of a pilot and dedicated rear gunner, who operated the remote controlled turret at the rear.

The SM.92 was powered by two Daimler-Benz DB 605 engines producing a combined 2580 hp - fitted to the front of each boom, the engines drove three-bladed propellers. This powerplant enabled the SM.92 to reach a maximum speed of 630 km/h at altitude, with a service ceiling of 12 km. The armament consisted of three MG 151/20 cannons mounted on the centreline and inside the starboard propeller hub, as well as four Breda-SAFAT machine guns mounted firing forwards. A single additional Breda-SAFAT gun was mounted firing rearwards in the tailcone, though this weapon had a very narrow defensive arc.

=== Prototype history ===
Construction of the first SM.92 prototype was slow and only completed in late 1943; the prototype took flight for the first time in October of that year. The actual performance of the aircraft was worse than expected, but despite this, the prototype still flew for over 20 hours. In March of 1944, the prototype was airborne when it was engaged by an axis pilot, flying a Macchi [[C.205 (Family)|C.205]], who had mistook the aircraft for the Allied [[P-38 (Family)|P-38 Lightning]]. Having taken severe damage, the aircraft limped home and was grounded for repairs; it was in this state that the aircraft was destroyed by Allied bombing, ending the development of this interesting aircraft design.
