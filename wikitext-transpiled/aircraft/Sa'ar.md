== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Sa'ar was a later development of the [[Sambad]] (Super Mystere B2). The reason for its development was the weak, fuel-hungry engine of the Super Mystere, the Atar 101G-3 engine. Not only that, but it was also prone to mechanical failures. In 1967, it was proposed to use the engine of the [[A-4H (Israel)|A-4H]] in the Super Mystere. The Pratt & Whitney J52-P-8A engine was lighter, 25% more powerful, more reliable, and less fuel-hungry, but it had no afterburner. The new aircraft featured more ground ordnance capabilities, Shafrir 2 missiles, and a better range, at the cost of no longer being considered an interceptor due to the loss of its afterburner. By 1973, the upgrade program was completed, and all 26 Super Mysteres in the IAF were upgraded to the Sa'ar model.

Introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]], the Sa'ar is played in a very unique way in battles. It has the engine of the A-4 Skyhawk and also some of its weakness. It has a decent top speed for a subsonic fighter, but its acceleration and poor energy retention don't make the Sa'ar a frontline fighter. While it can go for bases, it's not recommended since equipping ground ordnance hampers flight performance severely and would become easy prey for supersonic interceptors like the MiG-19 and MiG-21. Instead, as a support fighter, the Sa'ar can have very good results, because at its BR most jets have no countermeasures, and the [[Shafrir 2]] is a relatively powerful missile with similar characteristics to the [[AIM-9D]].

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The aircraft features a rather weak engine with a low acceleration and bad energy retention. It is greatly manoeuvrable at all speeds with little to average compression at higher speeds.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The aircraft features 14 mm steel plates in front of the instrument panel and behind the pilot as well as 40 mm of bulletproof glass angled at 61 degrees, which can save the pilot from some fragmentation. Getting shot most times will result in a fire due to the self-sealing fuel tanks being everywhere on your aircraft, from the center of the fuselage all the way to your wingtips. The engine is also quite large and will easily get shot and set on fire.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In Air RB, this aircraft can be used with minimum fuel load and the 2 x Shafrir 2 loadout , firing your amazing missiles at others that are unaware of you and using your manoeuvrability to engage in 1-vs-1 dogfights. Make sure no other enemies are around since you will get slow after the first few turns.

In Ground RB, this aircraft can greatly utilize its CCIP picking the 2 x Shafrir 2 + 16 x 100 kg bombs, dropping a single pair accurately on each target and ensuring a destruction with their large TNT explosive mass. This aircraft also features Zuni and Mighty Mouse rockets but due to a lack of CCIP, scoring accurate hits will be harder.

It is worth mentioning that this aircraft also has much bigger bombs (100 kg, 250 lb, 250 kg, 360 kg and 500 kg) that can be used both in Air RB to bomb bases and in Ground RB, but they significantly slow your plane down. These heavier bombs also grant the ability to achieve up to 8 drops, which can help secure 8 or more destructions in Ground RB.

Despite lacking engine thrust, it features decent manoeuvrability and armament options where if you get used to this vehicle, you can see great results in all gamemodes.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent Shafrir 2 air-to-air missiles with long range and good turning ability
* Wide variety of air-to-ground ordnance
* Decent manoeuvrability
* CCIP and CCRP for bombs

'''Cons:'''

* Weak engine; lacks the afterburner the previous Sambad has
* Poor survivability
* Poor energy retention
* Low muzzle velocity for the DEFA cannons

The Sa'ar was a further development of the Super Mystere B2 Sambad by Israel. Its development can be traced back to 1967 when it was proposed to use the Pratt & Whitney J52-P-8A engine in Super Mysteres because of their unreliable engine. The engine used in the Super Mystere, was the Atar 101G-3. This engine had an afterburner and allowed the Super Mystere to reach supersonic speeds. However this came at the cost of reliability, elevated fuel consumption and frequent mechanical issues, not to mention that it was a very heavy engine, and when not using the afterburner it was also very weak. The upgrade was also motivated by the French embargo imposed over Israel in 1967, this embargo affected the acquiring of parts and other equipment needed to maintain the Atar 101G-3 engine.

In 1969, field tests were carried with a modified Super Mystere using the J52-P8A. It was found that the engine was lighter, less fuel hungry and 25% more powerful. Thus the Sa'ar was capable of carrying more ground ordnance, and as such, it was equipped with a ballistics computer for bombs, it also had more hardpoints and Shafrir 2 AAMs for air-to-air combat. Soon, the upgrade for all the Super Mystere fleet (26 units) of the IAF was approved and work began by Israel Aircraft Industries at Lod Airport. The first production units were handed to the IAF in 1969 and by early 1973, all 26 Super Mysteres were upgraded to the Sa'ar model.

During the Yom Kippur War, the Sa'ars of the 105 Squadron of the IAF conducted several sorties to help in the war effort. This aircraft participated on both the Egyptian and Syrian fronts. On the Syrian front, they were used to attack Syrian armour in the Golan Heights. Against the Egyptians, they were both used for air cover and ground attacks, but were primarily used against the Egyptian Third Army crossing the Suez Canal. Around 150 tanks were destroyed by the Sa'ar in a span of days, alongside artillery units, command posts, logistic centres and other armoured vehicles. After fighting in Egypt, the Sa'ar was relocated to Syria, where they were used to help in air raids deep in the country. When the IDF crossed the Suez canal, the Sa'ar was also there providing CAS capabilities and it participated in all major offensives of the war. By the end, the Sa'ars had flown 887 total sorties with 6 losses.

The Sa'ar was later replaced by the F-4 Phantom and 12 Sa'ars were sold to Honduras in 1976, where they remained in service until 1996.
