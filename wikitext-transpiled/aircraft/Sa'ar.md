== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The aircraft features a rather weak engine with a low acceleration and bad energy retention. It is greatly manoeuvrable at all speeds with little to average compression at higher speeds.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The aircraft features 14 mm steel plates in front of the instrument panel and behind the pilot as well as 40 mm of bulletproof glass angled at 61 degrees, which can save the pilot from some fragmentation. Getting shot most times will result in a fire due to the self-sealing fuel tanks being everywhere on your aircraft, from the center of the fuselage all the way to your wingtips. The engine is also quite large and will easily get shot and set on fire.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In Air RB, this aircraft can be used with minimum fuel load and the 2 x Shafrir 2 loadout , firing your amazing missiles at others that are unaware of you and using your manoeuvrability to engage in 1-vs-1 dogfights. Make sure no other enemies are around since you will get slow after the first few turns.

In Ground RB, this aircraft can greatly utilize its CCIP picking the 2 x Shafrir 2 + 16 x 100 kg bombs, dropping a single pair accurately on each target and ensuring a destruction with their large TNT explosive mass. This aircraft also features Zuni and Mighty Mouse rockets but due to a lack of CCIP, scoring accurate hits will be harder.

It is worth mentioning that this aircraft also has much bigger bombs (100 kg, 250 lb, 250 kg, 360 kg and 500 kg) that can be used both in Air RB to bomb bases and in Ground RB, but they significantly slow your plane down. These heavier bombs also grant the ability to achieve up to 8 drops, which can help secure 8 or more destructions in Ground RB.

Despite lacking engine thrust, it features decent manoeuvrability and armament options where if you get used to this vehicle, you can see great results in all gamemodes.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent Shafrir 2 air-to-air missiles with long range and good turning ability
* Wide variety of air-to-ground ordnance
* Decent manoeuvrability

'''Cons:'''

* Weak engine; lacks the afterburner the previous Sambad has
* Poor survivability

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Sa'ar, an upgraded version of the [[Super Mystere B2|Dassault Super Mystere]] using Pratt & Whitney J52-P-8A engines from [[A-4H_(Israel)|A-4H Skyhawk]] inventory, begin seeing service in the IAF (Israel Air Force) in February 1969. The name Sa'ar in Israeli means Storm.

The {{PAGENAME}} first saw combat in the 1973 Yom Kippur War as fighter-bombers. Only 6 Sa'ars were lost in combat during the war, with two pilots killed.
