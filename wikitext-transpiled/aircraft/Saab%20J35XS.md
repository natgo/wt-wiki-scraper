== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Saab J35XS turns very fast, however turning too fast at lower speeds can also lead to a "superstall", which may cause a crash. Tight turns also lead to a significant loss of energy/speed.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent speed
* Effective high calibre flares/chaffs
* Great turn rate at low speeds
* Extremely powerful in a downtier

'''Cons:'''

* Bleeds speed fast
* Janky gun placement makes it hard to aim
* Inadequate performance in uptiers
* Very limited count of flares/chaffs
* Average turn speed above ~900 km/h

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The SAAB J-35XS (Xerxes Sigurd/Export Suomi) is a Finnish export of the Swedish J35F interceptor. During and after 1970, Sweden provided second hand J35's to the Finnish Air Force. The first wave of exported Drakens were put into service on 1972, while the first J35 assembled under licence by Valmet was finished on March 12th, 1974. A unique feature to the Finnish variants was the ability to mount Soviet R-13M missiles, along with countermeasures such as flares and chaff.
