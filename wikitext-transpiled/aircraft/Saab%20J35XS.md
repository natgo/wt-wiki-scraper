== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The J35XS was part of a deal between Finland and Sweden so that the last one could provide Finland with different variants of the J35 Draken. At the beginning only second hand J35Fs, Bs and Cs were provided with minor modifications but Finland requested an upgrade variant of the J35F, more comparable to the J35J standard. Thus the J35XS was conceived, it had better countermeasures, electronics, a better radar (but still very similar), more weapon pylons and access to the RB-27 and RB-28 missiles, as well as the RB24J (AIM-9P). A total of 12 aircraft were produced of this variant, and was the only one assembled in Finland, while the kits were produced in Sweden by SAAB. In real life, the J35XS was also able to fire the Soviet R-13M1 (export variant of the R-13M) that was extensively used by Finland in their MiG-21s.

Introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]], the J35XS plays like all Drakens, fast and with good AoA capabilities. Of course, while doing manoeuvres it loses all of its speed, but it has a very interesting double delta wing design, that allows the aircraft to retain energy at high speeds at the cost of agility. It has access to 6 x RB24Js which are just AIM-9Ps. This missile has a decent range and acceleration, as well as 20Gs of pull. While these don't get you consistent destructions, they still perform decently when launched at unaware opponents. It also has access to 12 countermeasures, not a lot, however being deployed 1 by 1, they can last for a good time and while being better than nothing, they are ultimately sub-optimal at best. This means that taking chaff is not recommended, and thus flying close to the ground to avoid radar locks is highly advised. Also, it uses an IRST coupled with its radar. This allows to lock to the heat signature of jets and slaving the missile to that lock, but the locked target wont receive a warning unlike radar, that triggers the RWR if it's able to detect the lock. The problem is that IRST can't identify if the lock is friend or enemy, so watch out for friendly fire.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Saab J35XS turns very well, however turning too hard at lower speeds can also lead to a "superstall", which may cause a crash. Tight turns also lead to a significant loss of energy/speed.

Being that the Saab J35XS is also a double-delta wing, its sustained turn rate is fantastic, the energy retention not so much, thus leaving the aircraft in a much-to-be-desired energy and speed state. An issue most pilots may run into in a dogfight is an issue with only one sidemounted Akan m/55 30 mm, making getting good shots in a dogfight difficult.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
As with all delta or double-delta wing configurations, your silhouette is significantly larger than other contemporary aircraft you'll face from 9.7-11.7. The fuel tanks are located close to the center of the fuselage, meaning that most rounds that connect with your aircraft will likely cause you to burn up. The engine is also massive and fragile, meaning that even a glancing blow from an enemy's gun can critically damage your engine.

Flight characteristics are also heavily damaged with even minor damage to the wings, particularly if the damage is uneven, greatly increasing the chances of getting into a irrecoverable flat spin. As with most aircraft of the BR, you will not be able to survive a missile if it comes into contact with your aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!--''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The J35XS is played as a very capable dogfighter/interceptor in War Thunder. At its BR, it gets a set of 6 x RB24J air-to-air missiles (AIM-9P), that even while only rear aspect, have a good range and decent acceleration, as well as the ability to pull 20Gs maximum. Not only that, the aircraft gets a powerful radar with a maximum of 90 km of detection range and 45 km for lock range. 

The J35XS also features an IRST, a rare sight in jets, and even rarer below 11.0. IRST stands for Infrared Search and Track and allows to detect infrared signals from rear and front aspect, and locking them. Unlike SARH, this mode does not have an IFF system, which means that it cant identify if the aircraft locked/detected is an ally or an enemy. This can prove very dangerous in '''Simulator Battles''', when it's not possible identifying if an aircraft is allied or not at long ranges. Still, a good combination in these situations is using the IRST in close ranges while using the radar at long ranges, this will ensure that the enemy aircraft is not warned if you are locked using the IRST. Apart from that, you can use the IRST to lock missiles easier and shoot them while manoeuvring and maintaining the lock. 

The J35XS has a limited fuel load of 20 minutes, and while the afterburner is not very fuel hungry, it will still leave you without fuel in EC maps if not careful. Without the afterburner you will top at Mach 0.96 with 100% thrust. You will also loose a lot of speed while turning, of course, this means that you can pull very tight turns and surprise your opponents with shots or missile launches. One of the biggest inconvenience with the J35XS is the cannon placement, while the cannon deals decent damage, the offset gun makes aiming very hard and lining up shots rather difficult, it's recommended playing a little in AB matches to get used to how your gun behaves, before participating in RB or SB.

The aircraft has access to only two air to ground options, the M/56D and M/57B rockets, the M/56D is the only useful against ground targets, since it has a HEAT warhead with good penetration values, but it's quite heavy and slow. The 57B in the other hand uses a HE warhead, but it's too small, with only 15 mm of penetration and 1.14 kg of explosive mass, that wont kill anything at high BRs even with a direct hit.

Finland obtained the Swedish SAAB J35 Draken in 1970, as part of a collaboration between the two countries so that Sweden could provide the Finnish Air Force with J35 aircraft of different variants. At the beginning Finland only received second hand models like the J35F, J35B and SK35C. However the J35XS variant was made by Finnish request and built as a kit assembled by Valmet in Finland. Valmet was also allowed to produce the spare parts for this aircraft. The XS stands for Export Suomi (Export Finland).

The J35XS was highly based on the F variant, and could be considered an intermediate step between the more advanced J35J and the J35F. The new aircraft, fitted more weapon pylons, a better countermeasure suit and different radar model.

The Draken was flown by the Finnish Air Force alongside the Soviet MiG-21, because of logistics, all SAAB J35s in Finland, including the J35XS, had the ability to use the soviet made R-13M1, that was quite different to the R-60s used by soviet aircraft by that point. Finland also acquired the Falcon missiles (RB-27) and the RB-28 to be used in their brand new Draken fighters.

For the J35XS, it was sometimes also referred as J35S or DKS 35 (DK stands for Draken, but for practical reasons most of the time they remained in service with the Swedish prefixes). At the beginning, only the second hand J35s were delivered, but because of their lack of countermeasures and/or electronics, Finland requested the production of the J35XS, that was tested on trials in 1974 after being completed by Valmet (designation DK-201). Piloted by Swedish SAAB test pilot KG Liljeqvist, the XS results were successful and soon the total of 12 units were assembled by Sweden.
