== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''British Aerospace Sea Harrier''' was a VTOL fighter-bomber based on the successful [[Harrier GR.3]]. It entered service with the Royal Navy in April 1980 as the Sea Harrier FRS.1. This aircraft was equipped with a single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, as well as a Ferranti Blue Fox radar. The early service variant of the FRS.1 included a bubble canopy that would characterize later variants of the Sea Harrier, it also featured AIM-9L AAMs for self defence, later variants of the Sea Harrier introduced modifications to the pylons, to be able to carry more AIM-9L sidewinders, as well as Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles after the Falklands War.

It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]]. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is not very different from many other Harriers in-game in terms of gameplay. It has very good acceleration, meaning that it is one of the first to take off from the runway, while also having access to a decent radar and 2 x AIM-9L Sidewinders. Like all Harriers, it features VTOL. It lacks any sort of guided ordnance for ground battles, but its 5 x 1,000 lb bombs are enough to destroy a base in air battles, or a couple of ground targets if used properly, though for this task more specialized attackers like the [[Jaguar GR.1A|Jaguar]] are more recommended.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Sea Harrier has a very similar performance to other Harriers in-game. It has an excellent low speed acceleration, and good agility at high speeds, at the cost of energy retention, which is very poor. This aircraft is also capable of vertical landings and take-off without heavy payloads.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Sea Harrier lacks any sort of armour, and it has a mediocre survivability, since the engine is pretty large and vulnerable because it is located at the centre of the aircraft. However it does feature 60 x countermeasures for defence against radar and IR guided missiles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Fighter Role:'''

The Sea Harrier sits at a BR where supersonic fighters start to become very common, however the Sea Harrier does have access to a set of powerful missiles. The early AIM-9G Sidewinders are good but they lack all-aspect seekers, the AIM-9L fixes this issue, while also having much better manoeuvrability. When playing as a fighter, it can be a good idea to climb to high altitudes in downtiers, then launch your IR missiles at enemies within range, since both the AIM-9G and AIM-9L have good range for a small IR missile, they can be launched at enemies within 3-4 km, even more if the enemies are at a low energy state. In uptiers, fighting close to the ground is more recommended, since SARH missiles start to become deadlier and more common, however the idea stays the same, launching missiles at enemies without flares or at a low energy state from distance. The Harrier has good performance at high speeds but becomes more sluggish below 800 km/h, so it is highly recommended staying at those speeds.

'''Bomber/Strike Aircraft Role:'''

As a strike aircraft, the Sea Harrier can be used with some success, in downtiers or slight uptiers, it can be used to destroy a single base when carrying a custom loadout of 5 x 1,000 lb bombs, you can also carry 2 x AIM-9Ls alongside your bombs. When doing this, flying close to the team is very recommended, since the Harrier's already lacklustre flight performance is hampered by the addition of heavy payload, the Sea Harrier also loses the ability to take off vertically with a heavy loadout. The good low speed acceleration means that even with the bombs attached, it will be one of the first to take off from the runway, however the rest of the team will quickly catch up. Doing bomb runs in uptiers is not recommended, since much faster strike aircraft will outrun you and destroy most valuable bases and ground targets before you do. For ground battles, the Sea Harrier lacks access to guided ordnance or rockets with a HEAT warhead, the RP rockets use a HE warhead that is extremely underpowered even against lightly armoured targets.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very good low speed acceleration
* Access to vertical landing/take-off
* Good agility at high speeds
* Access to 2 x AIM-9L all aspect missiles
* Access to a radar, unlike most Harriers
* Modern RWR with ability to detect track, launch and TWS modes

'''Cons:'''

* Can't use VTOL mode with heavy payload
* Lacks any sort of guided ordnance against ground targets
* Poor agility below 800 km/h
* Limited WEP
* Relatively underpowered radar when compared to more advanced fighters around its BR
