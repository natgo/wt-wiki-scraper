== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British naval fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"]].

As the name implies, this is a carrier based version of the Hurricane. The Mk I/L is the closest counterpart, however several key differences are present. First off, this version can operate from carriers. This grants a massive improvement in versatility, as you can launch from both airfields and carriers. In addition, this variant features reinforced landing gear in order to survive hard carrier landings. However, the extra weight of the landing gear is also the Sea Hurricane's biggest flaw. In Arcade, this makes minimal difference to performance, but Realistic and Simulator are a different story. Climb rate, turning ability, and minimum take-off speed are all noticeably worse. That doesn't mean this is a bad aircraft though. It just takes a pilot with the knowledge of these facts and how to counter them to succeed with the plane. Boom and zoom tactics can be used to greater effect than the [[Hurricane Mk I/L]] thanks to improved dive acceleration from the extra mass. The only problem is getting up there. Still, this is a very good aircraft when used properly.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

Due to the extra weight, the {{PAGENAME}} has an slightly inferior flight performance compared to the [[Hurricane Mk I/L]].

* 12.7 mm Steel plate behind the pilot.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 8 x 7.7 mm Browning .303 machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 2,800 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Hurricane is one of the first monoplane fighters in the British tech tree. As such it will face a mix of biplanes and monoplanes with a different playstyle required for each.

Against biplanes, the Hurricane plays similarly to a heavy fighter. The large number of guns allows you to down anyone in your crosshairs quickly even if you don't have the best aim. Do not try to dogfight biplanes. While it is possible to win a dogfight against biplanes, it will bleed all of your plane's energy forcing you to continue to turnfight any enemies that decided to join the fight even if it is not in your best interest. You are better off BnZing biplanes. They might be able to tickle your rear as you extend away due to their quick turn time and your relatively slow speed but the Hurricane is durable enough to survive some MG fire.

Against monoplanes, the Hurricane must be played in the complete opposite fashion. Your plane will likely be slower and climb far worse than your opponent however your turn rate will likely be better, so try to force them into a turnfight. Monoplanes also generally carry heavier armament so your durability advantage is negated.

Overall the Hurricane is a novice-friendly plane with high firepower and predictable flight characteristics that can be taken to the next level with careful energy management.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* A lot of firepower for its rank
* Flight similarity to the land-based Hurricane means it's easy to transfer skills
* Good turn time
* Excellent over-the-nose visibility ensures easy tracking and leading in cockpit view
* Very smooth handling in simulator

'''Cons:'''

* Slower climb due to extra weight
* Quite slow in overall speed
* Engine overheats extremely fast while using WEP
* Loses energy quickly in turns

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/ History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Hawker Sea Hurricane Mk IB was the first carrier-capable Hurricane; the previous Mk IA Sea Hurricane was designed only for catapult assisted takeoff, with no means of recovery back onto the ship. The Mk IB featured catapult spools and an arrestor hook. Starting in July of 1941, the Sea Hurricane Mk IB operated from HMS ''Furious'' and starting in October 1941 they operated from Merchant aircraft carriers (cargo ships modified with a flight deck). On 31 July 1941, Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron, operating from HMS ''Furious'', shot down a Do 18 flying boat - the first aerial victory of the aircraft. From testing, the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) preferred de Havilland propellers to the Rotol propellers. This was because the heavier Rotol propeller could cause the plane to dip forward and the propeller would hit the carrier deck, while the lighter de Havilland propellers could avoid this issue.
