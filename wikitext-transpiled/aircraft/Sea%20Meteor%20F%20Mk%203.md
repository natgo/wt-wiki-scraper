== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In 1948, two [[Meteor F Mk 3]]s were navalised for carrier trials. They were fitted with tail hooks and had reinforced underbellies and landing gear, as well as being equipped with the new, more powerful Derwent 5 jet engines. The two aircraft undertook a number of take-off and landing tests aboard HMS Illustrious and Implacable. While the Royal Navy were impressed with their performance, it was instead decided to commission the [[Attacker FB 1|Supermarine Attacker]] for the role.

In the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27, the Sea Meteor solves one of the main issues of the preceding Meteor F Mk 3: its relatively lacklustre engine performance. Equipped with engines almost twice as powerful as the original Derwent Is, the Sea Meteor is certainly not lacking for speed and acceleration. However, this upgrade comes with a significant drawback: the extra power means that the Sea Meteor can reach structural failure extremely easily, capable of ripping its wings even in level flight, let alone at the hint of any manoeuvres at high speeds. Despite the importance of maintaining speed in jet gameplay, it is highly recommended to utilise the airbrake if necessary when diving or manoeuvring, lest you become a meteorite heading straight into the sea. The Sea Meteor exhibits the same excellent manoeuvrability of the original Meteor once this immediate issue has been mitigated, and has more than enough thrust to regain speed or separation after an engagement.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Sea Meteor F Mk 3 is navalised version of the [[Meteor F Mk 3]]. While the navalised components (tail hook, stronger gear, etc.) have added approximately 1,250 kg to the aircraft's weight, the Sea Meteor has also had its Derwent 2 engines replaced with vastly more powerful Derwent 5 engines. The end result is that the Sea Meteor has a ~25% increase in thrust to weight ratio over the Meteor F Mk 3. This improvement gives the Sea Meteor excellent acceleration and speed compared to its predecessor.

The Sea Meteor is essentially a much more powerful Meteor F Mk 3, and can be played as such. The good handling characteristics of the original Mk 3 are retained, but acceleration, speed, and energy retention are all vastly improved. The main drawback is that the increased weight and speed of the aircraft makes wing ripping much more of a problem, you should be careful during turns and remember that you can pull less Gs than the regular Mk 3. The speed of the Sea Meteor also needs to be kept in check, if left to its own devices it will quite happily accelerate until the wings fall off, even in level flight. If you need to slow yourself down when diving on enemy aircraft the airbrakes should be your first port of call, by keeping the engines spooled up you allow yourself to rapidly accelerate away from your target after an attack.

;Enemies worth noting
* [[F-84 (Family)|F-84G models]] - They have a similar top speed to the Sea Meteor F Mk 3 and a higher wing rip speed. The higher wing rip speed gives the F-84Gs an advantage in a high speed dive.
* [[La-200]] - It is faster and has a higher wing rip speed than the Sea Meteor F Mk 3 and will be able to catch up to the Sea Meteor when speeding away.
* [[IL-28 (Family)]] - It has a similar top speed to the Sea Meteor F Mk 3.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good turn time
* Plenty of cannon ammo (190 RPG on two of the guns, 200 RPG on the other two)
* Extremely fast
* Good acceleration
* Very good energy retention
* Faster than most aircraft it faces when down-tiered

'''Cons:'''

* Loses manoeuvrability at higher speeds
* Wings rip easily both due to speed and g-load
* It is possible to exceed wing rip speed in level flight
* Average velocity guns makes aiming hard
* Lacklustre roll rate

The Gloster Meteor was the RAF's first jet powered aircraft, and the only Allied jet to see combat in the Second World War. An all-metal, single-seat fighter with two turbojet engines, it first entered service in 1944. The aircraft's development started in August 1940 and was given Air Ministry approval in November of the same year. The Ministry of Aircraft Production drew up the official F.9/40 specifications for a heavy interceptor fighter to be designated as Type G.41; the first prototype fighter flew on March 5th 1943 at RAF Cranwell. At the beginning of 1944, the aircraft was launched into full-scale production under the designation of Gloster Meteor F.Mk.I (Type G.41A). The type entered service with No 616 Squadron who, after conversion to the Meteor from their Spitfire Mk.VIIs, used the ground breaking fighter to successfully intercept V-1 'flying bombs' which were being launched from bases in occupied Europe to attack targets in England.

The Gloster Meteor F.Mk.III fighter that entered service in August 1944 became the first full-scale production version of the aircraft. The F.Mk.III version was powered by two Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.I turbojet engines producing 910 kg of thrust. Furthermore, a number of changes were introduced in the design: the dive flaps were improved, the fuel quantity was increased, and the airframe was partially reinforced. Externally, the F.Mk.III differed from the F.Mk.I by its new cockpit canopy, which was not side-opening but sliding.

The fighter's armament consisted of four 20 mm British Hispano Mk.II cannons with 200 rounds per gun in the upper pair and 190 rounds per gun in the lower pair.

A 180-gallon (818 L) fuel tank could be suspended under the fuselage. Two 100-gallon (455 L) external fuel tanks could also be mounted under the wing panels. As an experiment, the suspension of two 500 b (227 kg) or 1,000 (454 kg) bombs or 16 rockets was attempted.

The first F.Mk.III fighters produced in September 1944 had Rolls-Royce Welland engines producing 770 kg of thrust, as the Rolls-Royce Derwents were not yet mass-produced. These aircraft were designated as the G.41C. The 16th and subsequent production aircraft were the first to have standard Derwent Mk.I engines; these were designated as the G.41D. The last 15 production aircraft assembled were the G.41E version, with extended nacelles designed for the subsequent version of the F.Mk.4.

In 1948, two production aircraft were converted to the Gloster (Sea) Meteor F.Mk.3 version for Royal Navy test flights from aircraft carriers. The fighters had their armament removed, a landing hook fitted, and the gear legs reinforced. The Derwent Mk.1 engines were replaced with Derwent Mk.5 models. These aircraft performed 32 landings on board HMS Illustrious.

The Gloster Meteor was the first British production jet fighter and the only Allied jet aircraft to take part in World War II. The first F.Mk.IIIs were delivered to the front in the end of January 1945. Jet aircraft were considered to be secret and, as a result, a great number of limitations were imposed on their combat use. This included a complete withdrawal of permission to operate over German held territory in case the revolutionary technology was captured by the enemy. Meteors did eventually operate out of Belgium as part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force, where they were employed in ground attack and reconnaissance missions.

The total number of F.Mk.III Gloster Meteors built was 210, but service after the end of the Second World War would see further development and operational sorties in combat.
