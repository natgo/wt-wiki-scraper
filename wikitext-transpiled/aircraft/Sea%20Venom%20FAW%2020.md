== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British naval jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 "Battle March"]].

The Sea Venom FAW.20 is a carrier-based jet fighter located in the British naval line after the [[Sea Hawk FGA.6]]. The Sea Venom has very good diving characteristics, good roll rate making it a notable defensive flyer, and decent speed characteristics for a jet of its battle rating. It should be played as a Boom & Zoom aircraft, and it's very important to keep its speed up as the acceleration is somewhat lacklustre.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Sea Venom is a relatively light jet but heavy compared to other planes it will face, especially prop planes. Despite the high agility of the Venom compared to other jets, it is really mediocre against prop planes as most of them will outturn you within seconds. It maintains energy much better than it is to turn, meaning the Sea Venom should be flown as a Boom and Zoom plane rather than a turn fighter. Its acceleration isn't impressive compared to other jets and almost subpar to even prop planes. The Venom will lose a tremendous amount of energy when trying to turn fight a plane. Fighting at sea level is the way to go of this plane as only a couple of planes, like the [[MiG-15 (Family)|MiG-15]] will be able to catch you up. Be aware of jets like [[Sea Hawk Mk.100]] as they have air-to-air missiles which will catch you up.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 3 mm Steel plate under the jet engine.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The engine is somewhat underpowered, so it is recommended to research compressor and engine modifications first for better acceleration and top speed.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano Mk.V (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.V cannons, nose-mounted (150 rpg = 600 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Sea Venom has a fully air fighting role as the lack of ordnance and penetration for the 20 mm cannons make the aircraft useless for CAS or ground attack. The Sea Venom has 2 primary combat roles, as well as 1 last resort:

'''Bomber hunter:'''

The radar, speed, acceleration, and firepower make this jet usable for bomber hunting, especially when on cloudy maps as many planes at the BR lack radar. Pilots should use 30° climb to gain speed and altitude to be able to hunt bombers (always use aircraft carrier take-off when possible). Depending on the type of bomber that the Sea Venom encounters (jet bomber or prop bomber), tactics should vary.

'''''For jet bombers:'''''

[[Ar 234 B-2]], [[Ar 234 C-3]], [[IL-28]] (all variants), etc, the pilot must try to use their agility to their advantage as most of them carry both offensive and defensive weaponry and sometimes will try to dogfight you (with exception of Ar 234 B-2 and [[B-57A]]). IL-28 should be approached carefully as the 23 mm offensive and defensive cannons can tear the Sea Venom apart with small bursts. Use your speed to your advantage.

'''''For prop bombers:'''''

[[B-29/Tu-4 (Family)|B-29/Tu-4]], etc, the pilot must use boom and zoom tactics as big planes lack agility but have powerful firepower. These aircraft should be approached as any other prop bomber (head-on or from below). Be aware of B-29 and Tu-4 as both have ventral turrets that will harm you, approach them in a head-on or in a frontal arc of 45° (blind spot for most turrets) or in a very steep angle from above (although this should not be the main angle of approach as both B-29 and Tu-4 have a turret elevation of 89°).

'''Air superiority fighter:'''

The Sea Venom is one of the fastest jets at its BR (909 km/h at sea level with no upgrades) and will outrun most planes when energy is kept. Do not attempt to turn fight as you will lose a tremendous amount of energy and most planes will outturn you ([[Ho 229 V3|Ho 229]], [[Kikka]], etc). Boom and zoom and do not be afraid of running, most planes will not be able to chase you. Do not attempt to outrun enemy jets when uptiered as aircraft like [[MiG-15 (Family)|MiG-15]] will catch you easily.

'''Bait''':

This tactic should be a last resort when you are unable to take down any aircraft. The Sea Venom is a pretty easy target due to its small and tight cabin and small wingspan (although this can sometimes be beneficial) but can be used as bait for enemy planes for the same reason. Let friendlies deal with them while you grab their attention.

===Radars===
{{main|AI Mk. X}}
The sea venom is equipped with an [[AI Mk. X]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Adequate ammo supply of 600 rounds (150 RPG)
* Able to land on carriers in case an airfield is not available
* Able to take off from carriers, allowing acceleration from 0 to 300 km/h in couple seconds
* Good turn time and roll rate
* Good at defensive flying
* Very good at diving with a high rip speed of 1,040 km/h IAS
* Retains energy well
* Low compression at high speeds
* Faster than most aircraft it faces when down-tiered
* Has access to a search radar (max range 18 km, fast sweep)

'''Cons:'''

* G-LOCs easily
* Does not prepare you well for top rank combat (for new top tier pilots in air realistic battles)
* No payload (for tank realistic battles)
* Subpar acceleration
* Rudder effectiveness is inadequate, due to small size

=== Development ===
The Sea Venom, designed to succeed the de Havilland Sea Hornet, was the first all-weather jet-propelled fighter aircraft of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. Initially without folding wings, the initial Sea Venom prototypes were trialled aboard HMS Illustrious in July 1951. After a further two years of testing, the Sea Venom F.A.W. 20 designation models entered production in March 1953, forty were constructed over two years, finishing in June 1955.<ref name=":0">Thetford, O. (1991) ''British Naval Aircraft since 1912''. London: Putnam Aeronautical Books, pp. 111-13.</ref>

Further Sea Venom developments culminated in the production of F.A.W. 21 and 22 variants, respectively. These variants made improvements to the control surfaces and canopy; and incorporated upgraded ejection seats and American manufactured radar. The Sea Venom made great strides in safety in many areas, examples include the strengthened catapult and arrestor hook capability which increased the safety of take-off and landing; and the canopy advancements which allowed it to be jettisoned from the aircraft when submerged underwater. These were essential upgrades as the early F.A.W. Sea Venoms lacked any ejector seat at all which caused pilots great risk.<ref>Hobbs, D. (1992) ''Aircraft of the Royal Navy since 1945''. Liskeard: Maritime Books Duloe, p. 18.</ref>

Overall, 256 units of the de Havilland Sea Venom were produced and delivered to the Fleet Air Arm.<ref name=":0" />

=== Operation ===
During their service life, Sea Venoms saw significant combat. Their activity peaked with their involvement in the 1956 Suez Crisis, in which five squadrons of Sea Venoms conducted ground-strike sorties from their deployed carriers HMS Albion and HMS Eagle.<ref name=":0" />

Due to the all-weather nature of the aircraft, they were uniquely able to intercept jet bombers at night. Slight modifications to the breathing apparatus and oxygen distribution allowed the aircraft to reach these heights, though after the late mid-fifties they were decreasingly in consideration for interception duties.<ref>Jackson, A. (1987) ''De Havilland Aircraft since 1909''. London: Putnam Aeronautical Books, pp. 479-82.</ref>

The Sea Venom is also credited with the first operational firing of Firestreak infrared guided missiles by a Royal Navy fighter squadron aircraft, after successfully destroying drone targets in an exercise off the coast of Malta in 1959.

After the Sea Venom's retirement from carrier service in 1960, it was subsequently replaced by the de Havilland Sea Vixen. It was retired from ground service at RNAS Yeovilton in October 1970.<ref name=":0" />

=== [[wt:en/devblog/current/876|Devblog]] ===
The carrier-based Sea Venom FAW.20 fighter appeared as a version of the two-seater (seats for the pilot and radar operator) ground-launched Venom NF.Mk2 fighter, fitted with radar equipment. At the request of the navy, the base interceptor was equipped with an arrestor hook, a "folding" mechanism to store the wings for convenient storage on aircraft carriers, and a tail bumper to protect the tail unit from strikes on the deck. The aircraft completed testing and went into service with the "all-weather fighter" designation (FAW – Fighter, All-Weather).
