== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

The Seafire LF Mk.III was developed from the previous Seafire Mk.IIc which was a navalized version of a [[Spitfire Mk Vc|Spitfire Mk. Vc]] with modifications for carrier operations. France bought 141 Seafire LF Mk.III after the war and they saw combat above Indochina.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Seafire has an abysmal climb rate, it is also quite slow for a plane at its BR. Side climbing is advised. The turn time is slightly worse than the [[Spitfire LF Mk IX]] but still good enough to outturn most of your foes. The engine overheats rather quickly when using WEP, so avoid prolonged use.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

;Armour plates

- 7 mm steel plate behind the 4 mm steel pilot seat
- 6 mm steel headrest
- 38 mm front armoured glass
- 3 mm steel plate protecting liquid cooling system
- 3 mm steel boxes protecting magazines in wings

;Modules

- Vital components located at front of the aircraft (engine, fuel tank, pilot, radiator)
- One self-sealing fuel tank, one non self-sealing located above each other in front of the cockpit

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The 20 mm cannon belts should be the first upgrade to be researched due to the very poor stock belt. After that, research the first cannon upgrade module to reduce spread and overheating. Unlock then flight performance upgrades: radiator first due to the rather fast overheating of the engine when using WEP. After that, it is up to the pilot to decide if they would rather profit from better weaponry or flight performance.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (120 rpg = 240 total)
- 4 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 1,400 total)

The wing-mounted machine guns are very hard to use at distances over 300 m due to their placement in wing. Cannons does not have such issue as they are closer to the wing roots.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Seafire LF Mk.III is a jack of all trades, but master of none. The Seafire does not climb well, so after start of battle, pilots should side climb, stay at around 3,000 m of altitude and let better climbing teammates tackle the first wave of enemy interceptors, trying to pick off those that managed to dive down. Still retaining great turning capabilities, the pilot is advised to force enemies into turnfighting where they bleed their energy and become vulnerable. Avoid head-ons at all cost due to the very fragile radiator and engine: even a single bullet will take it out.

;Enemies worth noting

- Bf 109
- Fw 190
- A6M series
- P-47 Thunderbolt
- Yak-3/9
- La-7
- Ki-84

All the enemies in the list above can outclimb you, and also outrun you with the exception of the A6Ms. However, all those foes (except the A6Ms) can be outturned by the Seafire in an horizontal engagement.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Great sustainable turn rate
- Quite strong armament
- Clear visibility from cockpit with no frames obstructing view

'''Cons:'''

- Abysmal climb rate
- Low max speed compared to opponents
- Very fragile vital components
