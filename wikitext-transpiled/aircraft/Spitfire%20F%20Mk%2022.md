[[File:FighterImage_Spitfire_F_Mk_24.jpg|thumbnail|right|The new wing shape and larger control surfaces of the 22/24 series are a distinctive feature of the aircraft.]]
The Spitfire F Mk 22 an excellent plane in realistic battles with relatively few weaknesses, so the enemy will have a really hard time shaking the Spitfire off of its tail and only few will succeed.

The Spitfire F Mk 22 can keep up with most enemies in turnfights, excluding most Japanese fighters, other British fighters and several Bf 109s, all of which are more agile. Try to maintain a speed of between 400-500 km/h IAS; this is where the plane maintains great agility, turnfighting below this velocity against planes such as the [[Bf 109 G-14]] is really not recommended. It is very important to avoid hard turning above 500 km/h IAS, because the plane may lose its wing.

The main task for a pilot is to utilize the great climb rate to gain an altitude advantage on enemy fighters (altitude allows you to control engagements). Target altitude should usually be around 5-6 km on smaller maps and 6-7 km on larger maps such as Norway and Spain. The main form of attack (especially when there are more fighters around the target) is Boom & Zoom. Energy fighting is an option too, if in a 1-vs-1 situation. The Griffon Spitfire is an excellent energy fighter, the Griffon engine provides a tremendous amount of horsepower which can be used to gain speed quickly and climb back at a safe altitude. Remember to maintain speed, altitude advantage, and judge the energy state before engaging an aircraft.

When fighting propeller aircraft, you should use your superior engine power and flight characteristics to your advantage. Fighters should be engaged based on their individual strengths and weaknesses. When facing Soviet fighters it is not recommended to duel them below 4,000 m. Maintain altitude and energy and get your guns on target. Do not commit to head-on attacks and do not burn all your energy in a turnfight with a Bf 109 or a Japanese fighter, this Spitfire handles differently to the previous ones in the series.

=== Specific enemies worth noting ===

- Heavy bombers: they are best left to heavy fighters like the [[F-82E]] twin-mustang or the de Havilland Hornet due to their more potent, nose-mounted armament. If you must engage a bomber, you should engage from directly below or above, or in a head-on. Closing in from behind or the sides, you are exposing yourself to a barrage of heavy machineguns and autocannons which will shred your flimsy airframe. Most bombers only have a single defensive armament in the nose and above and below are typically gunner dead-zones or entirely unarmed. A two-engine bomber requires both to remain aloft, take one out and it will surely die. 4-engine bombers only need 2 or 3, so aiming for the engines is ill-advised. For these, you should take out the pilot or destroy the wing-tips to cause the bomber to fall into a flat spin. Alternatively, you can take out the tail controls to disable a bomber (this however requires a rearward engagement which is most dangerous).

- Jet fighters: they are strong, though not infallible. German and Japanese jets tend to have horrific performance at altitudes exceeding 4,500 m. You can bait them up and energy trap them. Once they have lost their speed they are incredibly vulnerable due to their atrocious acceleration, which you can exploit and quickly gain on them. Soviet jets also suffer above about 5,000 m. They also have very little ammunition and low speeds. American jets are the biggest issue: your best bet is to bait them into turnfighting or losing their energy, where they are most vulnerable.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- 4 cannons with a high rate of fire
- Excellent climb rate
- Quite agile at medium and higher speeds
- Very responsive elevator (starts to lock at speeds above 600 km/h IAS)
- Greatly improved high-speed handling relative to previous spitfires
- Wing rip speed is noticeably higher than previous spitfires
- Brutal acceleration when using WEP
- Good performance at higher altitudes
- Excellent roll rate

'''Cons:'''

- From time to time, pitted against jets which can be tricky to outmanoeuvre
- Poor agility at lower speeds and significant drag/mass ratio at high speeds limits optimal combat speed range
- Easily set on fire due to the location of the fuel tanks
- Landing gear rips very easily during take-off and landing travelling in excess of 260 km/h
- Landing flaps also break off at roughly the same speed as the gear
- Somewhat sluggish without utilizing WEP
- Very sluggish when stock

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
The Supermarine Spitfire Mk.22 was a single engine, single seat fighter which served with the Royal Air Force during the early post war period. When the first Rolls Royce Griffon equipped Spitfires were tested it was obvious that a stronger airframe would be needed to harness the full power of the new engine. Added to this was the requirement for a much stiffer wing; the result of these findings was the Spitfire Mk.21. The Mk.21 was also fitted with larger ailerons and the same 2050 hp Griffon 65 engine which was fitted to the Mk.XIV and Mk.XVIII. By this point in the aircraft's life, the Spitfire was so different from RJ Mitchell's original concept that the notion of renaming the new aircraft the 'Victor' was considered.

The Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Boscombe Down began to test the Mk.21 in late 1944, but were deeply unhappy with the new Spitfire and recommended that no further attempts were made to progress the basic Spitfire design. Chief amongst the AFDU's complaints was directional instability: Supermarine attempted to solve this problem by modifying the control surfaces. It was only with the introduction of a new, enlarged tailfin and tail plane which finally solved the instability problems.

The Mk.22 differed from the Mk.21 only in having a teardrop bubble canopy – a change which had not required a new mark number in previous Spitfires – and a different electrical system. The Mk.22, as with the Mk.21, was armed with four 20mm Hispano cannons. The Mk.22 was more prolific and more successful than the Mk.21, with some 280 aircraft being manufactured. It was used to equip No.73 Squadron and twelve squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. In 1955 the Spitfire Mk.22 was declared obsolete by the RAF and many were exported to South Rhodesia, Syria and Egypt.
