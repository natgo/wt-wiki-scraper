== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.39]].

The Spitfire F Mk 24's Rolls-Royce Griffon engine is the fighter's greatest asset, but it is still very agile at medium speeds of around 400-500 km/h. When the Mk 24 cannot make use of its Griffon engine it is highly vulnerable, so pilots should take care to avoid situations where speed and acceleration is a non-factor in victory.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The Spitfire F Mk 24's performance relies on its engine and that should thus be the focus of research. It is recommended you progress through your research in the following order:

# Radiator

# Compressor

# Airframe

# Offensive 20 mm

# Engine

# Engine injection

# 150 octane fuel

# Wings repair

# Cover

# Fuselage Repair

After you have researched all of the above, complete the remaining research in any order. The Offensive 20 mm upgrade is incredibly useful due to the power of the "Air targets" belt on Hispano Mk.II cannons, which is why it is prioritized over the Engine upgrades even with the focus on engine-related upgrades.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (175 rpg inner + 150 rpg outer = 650 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|G.P. Mk.IV (250 lb)|G.P. Mk.IV (500 lb)|RP-3}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 2 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (500 lb total)
- 3 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (750 lb total)
- 2 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,000 lb total)
- 1 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bomb + 2 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,000 lb total)
- 3 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,500 lb total)
- 8 x RP-3 rockets
- 2 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs + 4 x RP-3 rockets (500 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:FighterImage_Spitfire_F_Mk_24.jpg|thumbnail|right|The new wing shape and larger control surfaces of the 22/24 series are a distinctive feature of the aircraft.]]
The Spitfire F Mk 24 is an outstanding plane in realistic battles with few weaknesses, meaning the enemy will have a really hard time either catching the Mk 24 or shaking it off of their tail, and only the most skilled of opponents will stand a chance.

It is very important to monitor your energy state, as the Spitfire F Mk 24 is a relatively large fighter aircraft and will be a big target at low speeds.

The main task for a Mk 24 pilot is to utilize the immense power of the Rolls-Royce Griffon engine, which allows the Spitfire to climb at an insanely high rate. The pilot should always use his climb rate to his advantage in combat, using his altitude to dictate the terms of an engagement. Target altitude should usually be around 5-6 km on smaller maps and 6-7 km on larger maps such as Norway or Spain where the Griffon engine will perform optimally.

The Spitfire F Mk 24's main combat tactic is Boom & Zooming due to its outstanding speed, armament, and engine output. Because of the last point, Energy fighting is an option open to the Mk 24 as well, when engaging an enemy separated from his team. The Rolls-Royce Griffon engine is what opens the Spitfire F Mk 24 to both of these tactics. Not only does the Griffon engine bestow the Mk 24 with incredible top speed, but it also causes the fighter to accelerate incredibly fast allowing it to keep its speed for longer even in a sharp climb.

Although boom-and-zooming and energy fighting are the main tactics of the Spitfire F Mk 24, the fighter is also able to keep up with most enemies in-turn fights with few exceptions (namely Japanese fighters). Try to maintain a speed of between 400-500 km/h; this is where the plane maintains a high turn rate. Turning below this velocity against planes such as the [[P-51H-5-NA]] is not recommended. The Mk 24 should avoid combat at low altitude especially versus Soviet fighters who excel below 4 km. The Mk 24's strength is at high altitude combat, where it can fully utilize the power of its Griffon engine.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
The Supermarine Spitfire Mk.24 was a single engine, single seat fighter which served with the Royal Air Force during the early post war period. The Mk.24 was the very last land based Spitfire of the long and illustrious line of fighters. It differed only from late production Spitfire Mk.22s in having two extra fuel tanks fitted in the rear fuselage and provisions for under wing rockets. Late versions of the Spitfire Mk.24 were also fitted with the short barrel 20 mm Hispano Mk.V cannon. Only 54 Spitfire Mk.24s were built with a further 27 being converted from Mk.22 airframes.

Contra-rotating propellers were tested on the Mk.21, 22 and 24 Spitfires but were still not perfected in time to see service on this last Spitfire variant. The contra-rotating propeller would, however see front line service with the Fleet Air Arm's Seafire Mk.46 and Mk.47. The Spitfire Mk.24 entered service in 1946 with No.80 Squadron in Gutersloh, Germany; the squadron later moved to Hong Kong. In January 1952 the RAF's last front line Spitfire squadron handed its aircraft over to the Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force, ending a legacy of over 25 years of perhaps the most famous and iconic fighter aircraft in aviation history.
