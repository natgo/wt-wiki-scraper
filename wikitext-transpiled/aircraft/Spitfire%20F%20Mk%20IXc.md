== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The superiority of the [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]] over the [[Spitfire Mk Vb|Spitfire Mk V]] quickly became apparent after its introduction in late 1941. While a new engine, the Merlin 61, with a two-stage supercharger had been developed, a new airframe for high-altitude operations was still in the works; thus, as an interim measure, the new engine was fitted into the [[Spitfire Mk Vc]], producing the Spitfire Mk IX. Even without the aerodynamic and structural improvements of the new design, the Mk IX was found to be an effective counter to the Fw 190, with much greater speed, climb rate, and high-altitude manoeuvrability than the Mk V, while matching its low-level performance. Many Mk Vc's would be converted to the new standard, and were armed in both all-cannon and B-type wing-style arrangements, but with the advantage of greater ammunition capacity due to the belt-feeding of the cannons facilitated by the wing redesign. In early 1943, the Merlin 61 engines were gradually replaced by the Merlin 63, and production of the Spitfire F Mk IX was finally halted in late 1943 in favour of the Merlin 66-powered [[Spitfire LF Mk IX|LF Mk IX]].

Introduced in [[Update 1.77 "Advancing Storm"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/5438-raf-100-royal-air-force-centenary-en|2018 "Royal Air Force Centenary"]] event, the Spitfire Mk IX series is the pinnacle of the Merlin-powered Spitfires. They feature an exceptional rate of climb and adequate speed, whilst still retaining the manoeuvrability of their early lineage. The Spitfire F Mk IXc is also equipped with the hard-hitting quad cannon armament of the [[Spitfire Mk Vc]], allowing every opportunity for a critical shot to be easily taken advantage of. The Mk IX presents a good introduction to the more energy-fighting style of the later Griffon-powered aircraft, making use of the altitude advantage to make passes on an opponent while retaining the ability to return to a turn-fighting approach when desired. While the Spitfire Mk IX also finally comes with the ability to carry ground ordnance, the single option of a 250 lb bomb is very lacklustre, and its effect against medium and heavy targets is limited. It should be used only to engage lightly armoured vehicles and SPAAs, if at all.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 38 mm Bulletproof glass in front of the pilot
* 3 mm Steel plate on top of fuel tanks
* 4 mm Steel plate on pilot's seat. Behind pilot is another 6-7 mm steel plate
* 3 mm Steel plates around ammunition
* Critical components located at the front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (120 rpg = 480 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Significantly increased firepower compared to the regular [[Spitfire F Mk IX]] at a minimal performance cost
* Ammunition pool boost to 120 rounds per gun compared to the 60 rounds of predecessors
* Good low altitude performance
* Highly manoeuvrable and excellent roll rate
* Good climb rate
* Very good at Boom and Zoom
* Engine (fuel injected) will not shut off performing a quick Negative G manoeuvre unlike the Spitfires before it (RB/SB)

'''Cons:'''

* Poor acceleration and rate of climb at high altitude
* Heavy recoil when firing, although can be negated by tap firing
* Mediocre energy retention in sharp turns
* Only one flap setting (landing), and the ripping speed is really low
* Ammunition pool is easy to burn out without trigger discipline
* Hispanos overheat and jam quickly
* Light airframe, which can't withstand a lot of punishment
* Suffers heavily from compression in steep dives
* A leak in the cooling system can cripple the engine in minutes

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Spitfire Mk IX was the result of combining the Spitfire Mk V airframe with a Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 (F - fighter variant) , 66 (LF - low altitude fighter variant), or 70 (HF - high altitude fighter variant) engine in order to improve performance. The Spitfire Mk IX was hastily developed as a temporary response to the Focke-Wulf 190 while production of the improved Spitfire Mk VIII airframe was ramping up. Early models of the Spitfire Mk IX were equipped with what was known as the "c" wing. The "c" wing was designed to decrease production cost and time when compared to the "a" and "b" wings while allowing for use of universal armament installation giving it the nomenclature of the universal wing. The "c" wing was capable of equipping 8 Browning .303 machine guns, 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons and 4 Browning .303 machine guns, or 4 Hispano 20 mm autocannons. The most common configuration was that of 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons and Browning .303 machine guns as equipping the wing with 4 Hispano 20 mm autocannons resulted in technical problems which could cause the guns to malfunction at high altitude.<ref>The Spitfire Site (2010, April 15). ''The Hispano Cannon''. http://spitfiresite.com/2010/04/spitfire-the-hispano-cannon.html</ref> Later models of Mk IX were equipped with the "e" type wing which was a slightly improved version of the "c" type that allowed for the installation of 2 Browning .50 calibre machine guns and 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons.
