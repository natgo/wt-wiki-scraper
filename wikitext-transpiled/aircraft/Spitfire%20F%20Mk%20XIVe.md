== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Spitfire F Mk XIVe, being outfitted with a Griffon engine, does not have as stellar of a climb rate as its Merlin engine counterparts. However, it still does have a very competitive rate of climb, and can usually come out above all but a few opponents. With such an altitude advantage, the pilot is able to choose which engagements to pursue, and the ability to choose engagements wisely is necessary. Since dogfighting in the Spitfire can involve prolonged turn-fights, make sure that no other enemies are nearby, or that if there are, that they can be dealt with by teammates. This plane's engines gives it great acceleration, and it also accelerates well in dives. Be careful though, since at very high speeds, sharp manoeuvres may cause the wings to snap.

As far as manoeuvrability goes, the Spitfire is still very good at turning, especially at high altitudes. It also has a good roll rate, making rolling scissors manoeuvres a viable tactic in dogfights.

With these flight characteristics, the Spitfire is a sort of jack of all trades. It can turnfight well, of course, but it can also boom and zoom or energy fight with much success. However, the plane does have some drawbacks. For one, the powerful engine is prone to overheating, so throttle and WEP management may be necessary. Additionally, performance at low altitudes can be inadequate in certain situations. Finally, the only ordnance that the plane can carry is a single 500 lb bomb. While this can certainly destroy an enemy tank in ground realistic battles, precise aim is required to do so consistently, and the one bomb is the only anti-tank weapon that the plane has. Still, it excels in an anti-fighter role in ground RB; its excellent manoeuvrability is well suited for the gamemode's tendency to involve one on one dogfights.

The Spitfire F Mk XIVe carries a fairly standard ammunition count: not particularly high and not very low. It's possible to spray a little bit, but it is also wise to keep an eye on your ammo count, and to preserve ammunition if possible.

Supercharger - Use gear 1 from sea level to 4,000 m. Once you've hit roughly 4 km, switch to supercharger gear 2 to maintain performance. The output of the engine in the first gear will slowly gain from sea level to 2 km, then at 4 km and above it will begin to drop performance, which is when you should switch to the second supercharger stage. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very good at turning, especially at high altitude
* Excellent climb rate
* Very powerful engine that provides a very good acceleration
* Very good dive rate
* Good roll rate
* Very accurate guns when modifications have been researched and equipped
* Lots of ammo for cannons and machine guns
* Can perform turn-fights, Boom-and-Zoom and energy fighting equally
* Effective counter to high-altitude fighters (Ta 152, G.56, etc.)
* Bubble-style canopy offers excellent visibility for simulator battles

'''Cons:'''

* Poor performance and manoeuvrability at low altitude
* No combat flaps configuration
* Gear and landing flaps rip easily: safe landings must be approached very slowly
* Oil and water overheat quickly
* Guns perform inadequately when stock
* Insufficient close air support payload options
* Inadequate armament for hunting heavy bombers like the [[B-17G-60-VE]] or the [[G8N1]]
* Poor wing lift coefficient when at high altitude, low speeds and stock

The Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XIV was a single engine, single seat fighter which served with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. In 1941 the Spitfire Mk.IV was the first Spitfire to be trialed with the new Rolls Royce Griffon engine. By the time the Griffon Spitfire entered service with the RAF in February 1943, subsequent modifications had redesignated the aircraft as the Spitfire Mk.XII. As successful as this new Spitfire was at low altitudes, the Mk.XII's performance was actually inferior to the Merlin engine Mk.IX at medium and high altitudes. Thus, the Spitfire Mk.XIV entered service as an interim fix. Fitted with a Rolls Royce Griffon 65 with two-stage supercharger producing 2,050 hp, the Mk.XIV immediately corrected many of the performance shortcomings suffered by the Mk.XII. The fuselage was strengthened to harness the powerful engine and a five bladed Rotol propeller replaced the earlier four bladed examples. Early models were fitted with the Type C wing although later Mk.XIVs were equipped with the Type E wing housing two 20 mm Hispano cannons and two .50 cal Browning machine guns or four 20 mm cannons, as well as a high visibility teardrop canopy. A common modification to the Mk.XIV was the clipped wing, which increased roll rate and gave a marginal increase to speed, but at the most of rate of climb.

The Spitfire Mk.XIV entered service with Nos. 91, 322 and 610 Squadrons in southeast England where it saw notable success as an interceptor against V-1 Flying Bombs but also as part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force in operations over occupied Europe. Spitfire Mk.XIVs were also planned for use in the Far East but whilst a number of airframes were shipped to Burma, none were operational before the end of the war. The Spitfire Mk.XIV met mixed reviews from its pilots; whilst there was no doubt of the huge performance increase the new variant offered, it was uncomfortable to fly and lacked the balance and control harmonization of earlier Merlin engine Spitfires. Just under 1,000 Spitfire Mk.XIVs were produced with exports being employed by the Air Forces of India, Belgium and Thailand.
