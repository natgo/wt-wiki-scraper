== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The final Merlin-powered variant of the Spitfire, the Spitfire F Mk XVI was a [[Spitfire LF Mk IX]] equipped with the Packard Merlin 266 engine, a Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 licence-built by the American Packard Motor Company. Notably, the model represented in-game features the new "E-type" wings, which allowed either an all-cannon arrangement like the C-type or installation of M2 Browning heavy machine guns. These could also be "clipped", removing the wingtips to improve low-altitude characteristics at the cost of high-altitude manoeuvrability.

In the game since the start of the Open Beta Test, the Spitfire F Mk XVI is a very unique plane with an awkwardly unique role and design. Virtually identical to the [[Spitfire LF Mk IX]], aside from the clipped wings and bubble cockpit, the Mk XVI combines the low-altitude capabilities of the aforementioned fighter with the fantastic roll, dive, and speed capabilities of the German [[Fw 190 (Family)|Focke-Wulfe 190 series]]. The clipped wings give the Mk XVI a great roll rate and amazing dive and level speed and acceleration. However, compared to similar Merlin Spitfires, the turn rate is far worse, higher-altitude performance is abysmal, and climb performance is worse, though marginally. In terms of armament, the two M2 Brownings also provide a significant increase in firepower compared to the previous quad .303 Browning setup.

The Spitfire F Mk XVI is quite unique with its clipped wings. These give this version of the Spitfire a distinct advantage in roll rate, dive performance, and level top speed. However, they reduce the plane's ability to turn, and unlike other Merlin Spitfires this one is only average in its turning ability. Thankfully, it retains a good climb rate, even if it is not as high as that of the unclipped Spitfire variants. In addition, the clipped wings reduce lift at high altitudes, so performance is best when closer to sea level.

Thanks to a great roll rate, this Spitfire is very capable in defensive manoeuvres, and although turn rate is decreased, the boost in roll speed make this a great dogfighter as well.

This vehicle maximizes its performance at low altitudes. Below 1500 m, it has an incredible climb rate, very good top speed and acceleration, great dive performance, and generally outmatches its opponents. Still, there are some American and German planes that can outspeed and outdive this plane (especially since it locks up and may rip at high speeds), and the unclipped Merlin Spitfires outclimb this one.

This plane is equipped with 2 x 20 mm cannons and 2 x 12.7 mm machine guns. These are effective against fighters but may struggle against large planes such as heavy bombers. They can't destroy well-armoured ground targets, but can destroy lightly armoured ground targets and open-topped vehicles. Since all of these guns are wing-mounted, convergence should be kept in mind. A good convergence setting is usually between 300 and 500 m. Since cannon ammunition is somewhat limited, firing the 12.7 mm machine guns alone can be a good way to visualize the lead required to shoot enemies at longer ranges.

The Spitfire can also mount 2 x 250 lb bombs for destroying ground targets. These are quite small and must be aimed precisely to destroy the target. While this plane can be used in Ground Realistic battles, the fact that it can only carry 2 small bombs reduces its anti-ground capabilities. Instead, this plane can work as an air-superiority fighter in mixed battles.

The Spitfire F Mk XVI can rightly be considered a jack of all trades. It has some limited ground-attack capacity, decent guns, and flight characteristics that don't stand out in any one aspect. With a great roll rate; good dive and climb performance; and good energy retention, speed, and acceleration; this vehicle is a great low-altitude fighter as long as its weaknesses are understood.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Good climb rate, albeit lower than non-clipped wing variants
* Great roll rate
* Great dive acceleration
* Better dive speed than other Merlin Spitfires
* Better turning ability that most of its German and American counterparts
* New M2 HMGs are far more effective than the Browning .303s
* Good 20 mm cannons
* Ability to mount bombs for a ground attack option
* Slightly better simulator visibility due to its bubble cockpit
* Stock parts are not as bad as some other rank IV or V planes, such as the P-51D-5, Ki-84 and Late Bf 109s

'''Cons:'''

* Worse turning ability than all other Merlin Spitfires
* Worse dive speed than its German and American counterparts
* Poor performance at high altitude
* Relatively low rip speed (650 km/h)
* Low wing lift efficiency when at high altitudes or speeds under 320 km/h (200 mph)
* Goes through fuel very quickly on WEP for a prop plane, you might have to return for fuel with sustained WEP usage.

The Supermarine Spitfire was a British single-engine, all-metal, low-wing monoplane fighter. Various modifications served as fighters, interceptors, high-altitude fighters, fighter-bombers and reconnaissance aircraft.

The Mk XVI variant was very similar to the Mk IX; however, it was powered by a US-manufactured Packard Merlin 266 engine. A total of 1,054 Spitfires of this variant were produced. All production variants had the distinguishing feature of low-altitude clipped wings and a cut down rear fuselage and bubble canopy for increased visibility. The clipped wings increased the roll rate and top speed due to a reduction in drag, but sacrificed some of the fighter's climb rate. This, coupled with an engine optimised for efficiency in denser air made the Mk XVI ideally suited to combat at lower altitudes.
