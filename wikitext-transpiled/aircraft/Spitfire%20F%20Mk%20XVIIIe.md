== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Spitfire F Mk XVIIIe is nearly identical in playstyle to its predecessor, the Spitfire Mk XIVe. The only major difference between the two vehicles is the latter's ability to carry a larger and more diverse selection of suspended armament. Primarily, the Spitfire is the pinnacle of dogfighting at mid to high altitude. This fighter excels at catching unsuspecting pilots still climbing to altitude and excels in a turning and energy fighting playstyle.

With a powerful Griffon engine, this plane has amazing acceleration and climb rate--even better than that of the Merlin Spitfires. Although less manoeuvrable than they are, this Spitfire is still very capable in turnfights. Indeed, its mix of turning ability and engine performance is one of this vehicle's greatest strengths.

This aircraft has an ideal operating altitude of between 4,000 m and 6,000 m due to the properties of the Griffon engine, but this aircraft has no problems climbing past that altitude. However, manoeuvrability is slightly compromised at altitudes higher than 7,000 m. This aircraft excels at energy dogfighting, a mix between energy fighting and dogfighting. The insanely good acceleration coupled with the great climb rate and energy retention allows this aircraft to excel in horizontal dogfighting as well as vertical energy manoeuvres. Don't get into extended energy fights as many pure energy fighters can outdo this aircraft in pure energy fights.

American aircraft can outdo this plane in speed and energy retention, but cannot dogfight this plane very well. German planes are even more dangerous due to their high top speed and energy retention. This plane can adequately fight Japanese aircraft, but Zeroes can turn faster than the Spitfire, though they don't accelerate in a straight line as quickly. If you stay up above 4,000 m, you can deal effectively with most Soviet aircraft, which perform best lower down.

Boom and zoom attacks and pure energy fights are this plane's weakness; it does not hold up well in drawn-out fights of speed.

This plane is armed with both 20 mm cannons and 12.7 mm machine guns. They don't carry an extremely large ammunition pool but don't have too little either. A little bit of spray is fine, but it would still be wise to keep an eye on ammo count. In order to preserve cannon ammo, it is possible to fire the machine guns independently; this can be helpful in gauging the lead required to fire at enemies far away.

Additionally, this vehicle can mount up to 1,000 lbs of bombs or 8 RP-3 rockets. These can be used in Air Realistic Battles to destroy pillboxes and tanks. Even better, they are deadly in Ground Realistic battles, where they can destroy even heavily-armoured tanks. The quantity of suspended armament available to this aircraft and its very good dogfighting capabilities make this plane very effective in mixed battles: after dropping ordnance to destroy ground targets, the pilot can then shift to an air-superiority role, protecting friendly ground units from enemy attackers and fighters.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Great rate of climb
- Excellent turning ability and good roll rate
- Good zoom climber

The Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XVIII was a single engine single, seat fighter which served with the Royal Air Force during the early post war period. After the initial teething problems encountered with the introduction of the Rolls Royce Griffon engine to the Spitfire line, the Spitfire Mk.XIV had been used successfully in large numbers in the European Theatre of Operations. The Mk.XIV had seen notable modifications and transitions throughout its wartime service; the Spitfire Mk.XVIII built on this experience.

The Spitfire Mk.XVIII was also equipped with a Rolls Royce Griffon 65 engine with two stage supercharger rated at 2050 hp, high visibility teardrop canopy and a Type E Wing with two Hispano 20 mm cannon and two .50 cal Browning machine guns or four 20 mm cannons and externally was very similar to the later production Mk.XIV Spitfires. However, the Spitfire Mk.XVIII also featured a strengthened fuselage and an additional 31-gallon fuel tank in the rear fuselage.

The Spitfire Mk.XVIII entered service with No.60 Squadron at Singapore in January 1947. The Mk.XVIII was used offensively against insurgents during the Malayan uprising. The Mk.XVIII was also involved in air-to-air combat during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War where in one famous incident, two Israeli Spitfire Mk.IXs flown by a Canadian and an American pilot shot down four RAF Spitfire Mk.XVIIIs of No.208 Squadron.

Some 300 Spitfire Mk.XVIIIs were built with only the Royal Indian Air Force purchasing 20 as an export customer.
