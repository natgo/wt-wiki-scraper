== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]]. After WWII, Belgium's air force was able to be rebuilt, with Spitfires being selected to fill the role of general fighter. This aircraft's camouflage is of Spitfire FR Mk XIVe 'SG108' of the Belgian Air Force.

The Spitfire FR Mk. XIVe was a purpose-built low-altitude Reconnaissance airframe. This plane is an example of the 1945 "e" equipped with a clipped "e" type wing, allowing it to mount the respectable armament of 2 cannons and two .50 calibre machine guns. It has a camera for reconnaissance and the "bubble" canopy. The short wing tips vastly increase the roll rate of the aircraft but sacrifice some horizontal and vertical manoeuvrability. The powerful Griffon Mk.65 allowed it to climb better than the majority of enemy fighters at nearly all attitudes; however, the performance drop at altitudes compared to full winged XIVe's is noticeable.

== History ==
Following the end of World War II, like many formerly occupied European countries, Belgium started rebuilding its Air Force and turned towards the British government who agreed to supply aircraft.  The original plans called for the establishment of two day-fighter wings, "A-Wing" and "B-Wing", each of which would consist of two squadrons, each numbering 16 aircraft.

As part of the reconstruction of the Belgian Air Force, two fully Belgian-manned squadrons of the Royal Air Force, nos. 349 and 350 Squadron, were transferred from British to Belgian command on October 15th 1946.  Under RAF command, 349 Squadron had been standardised on the Spitfire LF Mk.XVIe variant, while 350 Squadron flew a mix of both the Mk.XIV and LF Mk.XVIe.  However, while the RAF was prepared to hand over both squadrons to Belgium, one condition was the return of the Mk.XVI Spitfires.  To replace these, the Belgian Government placed an order for 100 Griffon-engined Spitfire Mk.XIVs, all of which would receive a Belgian serial with an SG-prefix (Spitfire-Griffon; serving alongside Merlin-engined Spitfires with an SM-prefix standing for Spitfire-Merlin).

Deliveries of the original order for Spitfire Mk.XIVs started in April of 1947 and ran until July of 1949, with aircraft from Royal Air Force stocks being overhauled in the UK before being delivered to Belgium.  The aircraft delivered were a mixed bag: some were Mk.XIVs with the classic Malcolm Hood while others had the low-cut fuselage and bubble canopy; and a handful were FR.XIVs with provisions for reconnaissance cameras in their rear fuselage.  As deliveries progressed, the aircraft were initially delivered to 349 and 350 Squadron which had been organised into the 1st Wing at Beauvechain Air Base, where they replaced the Spitfire LF.XVIe, with additional aircraft being used to establish the 2nd Wing at Florennes Air Base from early 1948 onwards.  Two aircraft (RM769, June 19th 1947; and MV360, March 9th 1949) were written off in accidents during test or delivery flights, while a third (MV256/SG-39) was refused on delivery by the Belgian Air Force due to corrosion damage in the cockpit; as a result two additional Spitfires were delivered as replacements.  In addition, three non-airworthy Spitfires (NH694, RM712 and RM862) were delivered as instructional airframes to train ground crew.

The delivery of a considerably higher number of Spitfires than originally envisaged (the original plans called for 4 squadrons for a total of 64 Spitfires) allowed for the establishment of two extra Belgian Spitfire units: the 1st Wing at Beauvechain saw the establishment of an "Auxiliary Squadron"; while the 2nd Wing at Florennes saw the establishment of its 3rd Squadron in addition to the already existing 1st and 2nd squadron.  On top of that, a number of Mk.XIVs were attached to the Day Fighter School at the Koksijde Air Base, an operational conversion unit which had already been established on the Spitfire Mk.IX.

In April of 1949, the 1st Wing at Beauvechain started receiving the Gloster Meteor F.4, with 349 and 350 Squadron converting to the new jet while its Auxiliary Squadron initially retained its Spitfires before being disbanded.  At the same time, under the Western Union Defence Pact to which Belgium had subscribed together with the UK, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France, the Belgian Air Force committed itself to an expansion which would see the establishment of at least 12 day-fighter squadrons.  This planned expansion, together with a relatively high accident rate in squadron service, saw Belgium ordering an additional 30 Spitfire Mk.XIVs, all of which were delivered between August 1950 and March 1951.  These new deliveries, together with Nos 349 and 350 Squadron exchanging their Spitfires for Meteors, allowed for the establishment of the 10th Wing, consisting of nos. 23, 27 and 31 squadron at Chièvres Air Base, a temporary stationing pending the construction of their permanent base at Kleine Brogel.

The increased obsolescence of the Supermarine Spitfire, as well as deliveries of the Republic F-84E/G Thunderjet under the Mutual Defence Assistance Program from April 1951 onwards heralded the end of the Spitfire Mk.XIV in frontline service.  Starting in April 1951, the 2nd Wing at Florennes started converting from their Spitfires to the F-84E Thunderjet; the 10th Wing at Chièvres followed in 1952, with its no. 31 'Tiger' Squadron being the last to cede their Spitfires in November of 1952.  Following the withdrawal of the Spitfire from Belgian frontline service, the 47 surviving aircraft were pooled in the Day Fighter School at Koksijde.

This was merely a stay of execution for the Spitfire, as even in its conversion role it was increasingly being replaced by jet aircraft.  The Day Fighter School received its first Meteor T.7 trainers towards the end of 1952, followed by its first Meteor F.4s in early 1953 as they were starting being replaced in squadron service by the newer Meteor F.8.  On May 31st 1954, the 125th Promotion of the Belgian Air Force graduated, being the last class to have received conversion on the Spitfire Mk.14; two months later the last flights of a Spitfire Mk.XIV in Belgian Air Force service were flown at Koksijde, at which point the surviving aircraft were sold in batches to scrap dealers, with airframe SG-49 (ex-RAF TX995) being the last to be struck off charge in December of 1954.

Being a difficult type to transition onto due to its powerful engine torque, narrow landing gear and limited forward sight, take-off and landing accidents were frequent, accounting for a majority of airframe write-offs of Spitfire Mk.XIVs in Belgian Air Force service.  Between the first accident on May 21st 1947 and the last accident on August 5th 1954 in Belgian service, no less than 86 Spitfire Mk.XIVs were written off.  The brunt of the survivors were struck off charge between March and December of 1954 and sold for scrap, with only three aircraft being retained by the Belgian Air Force purposes for museum purposes: SG-55 (MV246) at the Royal Army Museum in Brussels (in fact, a composite of the wreckage of three individual aircraft); SG-31 (RN201), originally retained at a gate guardian at Beauvechain (following a restoration in the UK in the 1980s, nowadays airworthy as G-BSKP); and SG-57 (RM921), originally retained as a gate guardian at Florennes (nowadays on display at the Florennes base museum).  Two of the Spitfires disposed in the mass scrappings at the Day Fighter School also survived: out of a batch of Spitfires sold to an Ostend scrap dealer in 1957, SG-25 (RM927) and SG-108 (NH904) were retained as eyecatchers, before being sold on in 1967 and 1965 respectively; SG-108 was restored to airworthiness in 1981 as G-FIRE before eventually ending up with Palm Springs Air Museum as N1148P; while SG-25 was only restored to airworthiness as recently as 2022, being registered as F-AYXX to W Air  Collection at La Ferté-Alais in France.  A sixth ex-Belgian Mk.14, SG-38 (RM764, lost in a 1952 fatal accident), is rumoured to be under rebuild as OO-XIV at FAST Aero in Brasschaat near Antwerp, Belgium.
