== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

'''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/3071--en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/5608-shop-summer-sale-independence-day-en|2018 Independence Day Summer Sale]]. It has been made available again for the [[wt:en/news/5438-raf-100-royal-air-force-centenary-en|2018 "Royal Air Force Centenary"]], the [[wt:en/news/6866-special-80-year-anniversary-of-battle-of-britain-en|2020 "80<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Battle of Britain"]] events, and the [[wt:en/news/7154-shop-may-sale-in-the-gaijin-store-en|2021 May sale]]. It has also been available in-game for Golden Eagles {{GE}} for a limited time during the [[wt:en/news/7338-special-battle-of-britain-day-en|2021]] and [[wt:en/news/7871-special-battle-of-britain-day-en|2022]] "Battle of Britain Day" mini-events.

The plane is painted after the camouflage scheme of the plane Canadian pilot James Prendergast used in the No.414 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force, flying reconnaissance and ground attack missions over Europe before the Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day.

The Spitfire FR Mk. XIVe was a purpose built low altitude Reconnaissance Airframe. This plane is an example of the 1945 "e" equipped with a clipped "e" type wing, allowing it to mount the respectable armament of 2 cannons and two .50 calibre, a camera for reconnaissance and have a bubble canopy. The short wing tips vastly increase the roll rate of the aircraft but sacrifice some horizontal and vertical manoeuvrability. The powerful Griffon Mk.65 allowed it to climb better than the majority of enemy fighters at nearly all attitudes; however, the performance drop at altitudes, compared to full winged XIVe's is noticeable.

- 38 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen
- 4 mm Steel plates in pilot's seat
- 4-7 mm Steel plate behind the pilot
- 12.7 mm Steel plate between the fuselage fuel tank and oil cooling system
- 6 mm Steel plate in front of liquid cooling system
- 3 mm Steel boxes around wing ammunition

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

[[File:Spitfire FR Mk.XIVe (4).jpg|thumb]]
{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (135 rpg = 270 total)
- 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (260 rpg = 520 total)

The armament of 1 x Hispano Mk.II and 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun per wing is more than adequate for all but the heaviest of targets, cannon ammunition is low at only 120 RPG or 240 total. 20 mm ammo should be conserved as much as possible .50 calibre should be used vs. soft targets and on shots intended to force an enemy to manoeuvre. Neither can damage AI medium or heavy tanks but both can damage pillboxes when aimed properly.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|G.P. Mk.IV (500 lb)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 1 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bomb (500 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:Spitfire FR Mk.XIVe (3).jpg|thumb]]
Make sure to climb every match, better off having too much energy than too little.

When faced with an enemy of lower "E" (energy) state at equivalent altitude, zoom climbing and diving is incredibly effective. This can even be effective vs. the infamous Yak 3P.

''Rope-a-dope'' and ''scissors'' make good defensive tactics; lowering throttle may be needed to compensate for the lack of flaps. Also using the high roll rate and decent turning can throw off an enemy's aim but will cost you some speed.

Conserve ammo! Use your MG's to conserve cannon ammo whenever possible.

Head-ons are possible but not recommended due to the fragile engine, a better tactic is to fake a head-on but use your roll and turn speeds to dodge the enemy. However, Hispano cannons are very effective due to their lack of tracers, high velocity and damage.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Fast climber (best at roughly 300 km/h (185 mph) at 20 degrees)
- Excellent vertical manoeuvrability

- Fast roll rate
- Cools well at 100% throttle
- Dive speeds and handling is very good

'''Cons:'''

- Engine is water cooled and susceptible to damage

- Low ammo for cannons
- Lacks Combat flaps
- WEP has considerably higher fuel usage, take at least 30 minutes, preferably 45

== History ==

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The Supermarine Spitfire Mk.XIV was a single engine, single seat fighter which served with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

In 1941 the Spitfire Mk.IV was the first Spitfire to be trialed with the new Rolls Royce Griffon engine. By the time the Griffon Spitfire entered service with the RAF in February 1943, subsequent modifications had redesignated the aircraft as the Spitfire Mk.XII. As successful as this new Spitfire was at low altitudes, the Mk.XII's performance was actually inferior to the Merlin engine Mk.IX at medium and high altitudes. Thus, the Spitfire Mk.XIV entered service as an interim fix. Fitted with a Rolls Royce Griffon 65 with two-stage supercharger producing 2050 hp, the Mk.XIV immediately corrected many of the performance shortcomings suffered by the Mk.XII. The fuselage was strengthened to harness the powerful engine and a five bladed Rotol propeller replaced the earlier four bladed examples. Early models were fitted with the Type C wing although later Mk.XIVs were equipped with the Type E wing housing two 20mm Hispano cannons and two .50 caliber Browning machine guns or four 20mm cannons, as well as a high visibility teardrop canopy. A common modification to the Mk.XIV was the clipped wing, which increased roll rate and gave a marginal increase to speed, but at the most of rate of climb.

The Spitfire Mk.XIV entered service with Nos. 91, 322 and 610 Squadrons in southeast England where it saw notable success as an interceptor against V-1 Flying Bombs but also as part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force in operations over occupied Europe. Spitfire Mk.XIVs were also planned for use in the Far East but whilst a number of airframes were shipped to Burma, none were operational before the end of the war. The Spitfire Mk.XIV met mixed reviews from its pilots; whilst there was no doubt of the huge performance increase the new variant offered, it was uncomfortable to fly and lacked the balance and control harmonization of earlier Merlin engine Spitfires. Just under 1000 Spitfire Mk.XIVs were produced with exports being employed by the Air Forces of India, Belgium and Thailand.
