== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 38 mm Bulletproof glass in front of the pilot
* 3 mm Steel plate on top of fuel tanks
* 4 mm Steel plate on pilot's seat. Behind pilot is another 6-7 mm steel plate

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
All Spitfire versions served primarily as fighter aircraft. Due to its high manoeuvrability, the Spitfire LF Mk IXc excels in dogfighting, matched only by a few opponents (mainly Japanese). Due to its vulnerabilities, namely its low ammunition load and somewhat flimsy airframe, it is not recommended to attack bombers with heavy defensive armament. Its climb rate is one of the Spitfire's greatest advantages, being able to outclimb many rivals at its rank. Despite this, it is not recommended to try to catch up with zoom-climbing enemy fighters, because the Spitfire will most likely run out of speed before you manage to engage the opponent. Therefore, go into a shallow but high-speed climb to patiently gain the same altitude as the foe. Do not waste too much speed or altitude to the Boom & Zoom bounce from above, or else it will not work. In emergency situations, when an opponent is diving onto you, your speed is insufficient to face them and, when there are no clouds to hide in, you can descend to the tree-top level and use sharp turns and preferably uneven terrain to make dive attacks impossible for your opponent. He will most likely have to pull up before he can attack, due to his high speed. Exactly at that moment when he is pulling up, you can take initiative.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent rate of climb which will rival later Griffon Spitfires and most late war props
* Excellent acceleration from a standing start due to the boost configuration
* Good manoeuvrability, albeit lower than other Spitfires (I-V Marks)

'''Cons:'''

* Features the British 7.7 mm 303 Browning machine guns
* Tendency to break its wings during high-speed manoeuvres
* Very low ammunition count, must be very conservative
* Poor engine performance at high altitudes
* Expensive to purchase

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IX (Type 361) single-engine interceptor fighter/front-line fighter

A single-seat, single-engine, all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane fighter.

Not only the British but also quite a few pilots from other countries fought on Supermarine Spitfire fighters. The Americans used Spitfires, as well..

The beginning of the Spitfire was marked by volunteers who had joined the ranks of the British RAF before the USA joined the war. In 1941, there were three full-fledged American fighter squadrons in Britain, named the Eagles. The Americans originally flew Hurricanes, but in August 1941 they started their retraining on Spitfires. Until the autumn of 1942, the Eagles were common British squadrons with the corresponding staff, uniforms, and markings. On September 29, 1942, thanks to an intergovernmental agreement, the Eagles were transferred to the command of the Eighth Air Force of the USAAF, located in Great Britain. Three squadrons were combined to form the 4th Fighter Wing, and the tricolour British cockades on the planes were replaced with American ones.

Beginning in 1942, a number of the USAAF's fighter units which had arrived at the West European theatre of war without planes received British fighters as part of the so-called "Reverse Lend-Lease". These squadrons were originally based in Great Britain. Later, they were also based in North Africa. A total of about 1,000 Spitfires of various versions were handed over to the USAAF by the RAF.

For example, the 52nd Fighter Wing was redeployed in July 1942 from the USA over the ocean to Northern Ireland. It was there that American fighter pilots had to master the Spitfire. The Americans flew Spitfires when they joined the North African Campaign in November 1942. American pilots fought in Spitfires in the North African theatre of war until the German troops were defeated in May 1943.

The Americans used Spitfires (Mk.VIII and Mk.IX variants) in the skies over Italy as part of the Twelfth Air Force. By March 1944, the majority of the British planes had been replaced with Mustangs, but there were still some planes with those white stars on their fuselages all the way up until the Capitulation of Germany.
