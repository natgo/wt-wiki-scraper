== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Spitfire got into Israeli hands during the 1948 War of Independence and by the end of the war, most of the IAF's fighters were Spitfires of different models. The Black Spitfire (originally No. 2057) arrived in Israel in 1949 after the war. It served with the 101 in the same way as other Spitfires: reconnaissance and escort missions. When most Spitfires were sold to Burma in 1954, Ezer Weizman, then commander of the Ramat David air force base and future President of Israel, argued in favour of keeping some units in Israel. The Spitfire was painted black with the number 57. Even though it was supposed to be used for training purposes, many considered the aircraft to be personally owned by Ezer Weizman and the plane was flown in numerous parades in Israel, becoming known as "Weizman's Black Spit".

Introduced as a [[wt:en/news/7383-development-israel-a-new-gaming-nation-coming-to-war-thunder-en|premium pack]] in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]], '''Ezer Weizman's Spitfire LF Mk IXe''' is a formidable fighter. It has very good climb rate and acceleration, alongside the dogfight capabilities that are present in all Spitfires. Is capable of outmanoeuvring except maybe for some Japanese planes at its BR. However, some of its weaknesses are the lacking ground ordnance, thus is very hard to use for close air support, and the relatively weak engine. Though it is not a slow plane by any means, it will constantly fight planes that are much faster, and have better energy retention, including the [[I-225]], [[Yak-3U]], and [[P-51 (Family)|P-51s]]. Thus, very accurate shots are required, because the Spitfire loses speed rather quickly in dogfights against some of these aircraft, that way, prolonged fights are not recommended.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
The '''Spitfire LF Mk.IXe Weizman''' in the Israeli tech tree excels due to its superior maneuverability and climb rate, making it a formidable opponent in dogfights across all game modes—Arcade, Realistic, and Simulator.

In '''Arcade mode''', its agility is enhanced, allowing for tighter turns and quick reactions, although pilots must beware of high-speed maneuvers that could lead to structural failure. The quick reload times in this mode keep the Spitfire in the action longer.

'''Realistic mode''' demands careful energy management, where the aircraft's ability to climb and accelerate quickly allows pilots to engage and disengage effectively. The realism of flight physics means pilots must manage ammunition carefully and avoid overcommitting in dives to prevent wing damage.

'''Simulator mode''' challenges pilots with a realistic cockpit view and flight model, emphasizing the importance of rudder control and awareness to avoid stalls and spins. The Spitfire's maneuverability is key, but requires skilled handling.

For '''new players''', focusing on altitude advantage and the Spitfire's turning capabilities is crucial, while avoiding head-on confrontations. Veteran pilots can leverage energy fighting techniques and precise engagement control for dominance.

Overall, the '''Spitfire LF Mk.IXe Weizman''' is a versatile aircraft that rewards pilots with its agility and tactical flexibility, making it a rewarding choice for both newcomers and experienced players alike.{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

This plane is a formidable opponent when going against it. It has an astounding climb rate with a decent armament and still maintains that superb turn time that spitfires are known for. Because it is a low altitude variant, it is wise to stay below 5,000 m to get the best performance possible. Remember to use your supercharger when above 2,000 m: it will grant you a significant performance increase. Climbing is a valid strategy when you first spawn in because of your amazing climb rate. You are nearly guaranteed a height advantage over everyone. Maintain your altitude and lure enemies into a turn fight as there isn't anyone at your battle rating that can outturn you, the exception being a couple Japanese planes. Although this plane is a good turnfighter, exploiting your turn rate too much can lead to bleed a lot of energy and become an easy target for other planes. This plane is reasonably fast but for sure not the fastest at its rating. Do not head on with this plane. The 20 mm Hispano cannons are inaccurate, and jam quickly, even when fully upgraded. Instead, dodge and start a turn fight where the Spitfire will almost always come out on top.

Shortly after the establishment of the State of Israel, its new Defense Ministry began work on the formation of a more organised air force as a branch of the new Israel Defense Force. The first planes purchased were Czechoslovakian Avia S-199s - a partially-improvised version of the Bf 109 - but these proved to be inferior to Egyptian Air Force Spitfires. Simultaneously, Israel began acquiring its own Spitfires (primarily surplus planes previously given to Czechoslovakia by Britain) in a series of politically - and functionally - complex operations. By the end of the war, most combat aircraft in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) were Spitfires of whatever models could be acquired.

The Black Spitfire originally arrived in Israel in November 1949 (months after the official end of the war), and initially bore the number 2057. It served in the 101 fighter squadron. By this time, Spitfires were only used as bomber escorts and for reconnaissance flights. Most Israeli Spitfires were eventually sold to Burma in 1954; however, Ezer Weizman - then commander of the Ramat David air force base - argued to keep several of the aircraft in Israel. He ordered one of those aircraft, including number 2057, to be painted black, to match the colour scheme used by his former British airbase commander in Rhodesia during World War II, when Weizman trained as a pilot in the RAF. The plane was renumbered to "57".

Weizman kept the aircraft for training purposes in the IAF, but it was unofficially understood to be his own personal plane. Weizman later became Commander of the IAF and eventually retired, but nevertheless kept flying the plane during multiple IAF air parades over the following decades. The plane became famous in Israel as "Weizman's Black Spit", and was closely associated with the man. Weizman went on to become a member of the Israeli parliament, its Minister of Defense, and finally the President of the State of Israel. During his funeral in 2005 the Black Spit was flown over the burial ceremony.

The Black Spit is one of about 60 Spitfires that are still operational today. When not undergoing maintenance, it is occasionally kept on public display at the IAF Museum near Be'er Sheva.
