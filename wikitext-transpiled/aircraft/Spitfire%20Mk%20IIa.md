== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.35]].

For those who don't historically know much about the Spitfire, in 1940 in the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire flew to intercept enemy fighters because of its speed and agility- the [[Hurricane Mk I/L| Hurricanes]] were sent to destroy [[He 111 H-3|Heinkel Bombers]]. This same logic can be applied to War Thunder Realistic Battles- the Spitfire should first climb, using its excellent climb rate, then intercept high patrolling fighters, if possible, bringing them lower. The Spitfire is fast, with a top speed around 600 km/h, although in a straight line, it normally reaches around 460 km/h. Do not head-on in the Spitfire: it can destroy the engine and the gun convergence won't help at all, avoid head-ons and go for turn fights. A sensible opponent will try to energy fight the Spitfire- to avoid destruction, climb quickly away from them, then dart back into their trajectory arc, normally underneath them; the Spitfire can do that, since it has good lift rate- eventually, either the opponent will miss and overshoot, allowing the Spitfire to destroy them, or will dive, which the Spitfire can follow, but be careful- the Spitfire will wing rip at around 500 km/h or less, so don't pull too hard or the wings will fly away...

The Spitfire has a relatively good ammo count- the 4-digit ammo can be deceiving, since there are 8 guns on the aircraft, making only around 400 rpg- these can be used to ground attack light or unarmoured targets, usually with stealth or omni-purpose belts, but this job should be left to dedicated gun-platforms, like the Hurricane and [[F6F-5|Hellcat]]

{{main|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 8 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 2,800 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Spitfire should climb at the beginning of battle in order to utilise its very good climb rate. It can reliably attain an altitude advantage over the enemy, which allows the pilot to pick and choose which engagements they wish to take part in but you should not fight enemies while on high altitude as engine performance is terrible over certain one. 

The Spitfire also has very good turning characteristics, and turn-fight engagements are usually the best way to fight. It is possible to fake a head-on (by pulling away once your enemy starts firing) if you're forced to by an enemy plane but it is highly recommended to never commit to a head-on engagement. A sensible opponent will try to energy fight you which you need to look out for. You can lose your energy faster than you realize and when you do, you've most likely been baited and are an easy target. However, if you are able to engage the enemy in an extended turn, the plane's great turn rate will work wonders.

The Spitfire has a relatively good ammo count, spread between a very high number of guns. But, the 8 machine guns are only 7.7 mm in calibre, and are wing-mounted, meaning that convergence is an issue. This also means that accuracy when firing head-on can be difficult. It is recommended to set convergence at 300-500 m. This plane's guns can also be used against lightly-armoured ground targets such as artillery, AAA, or howitzers.

This plane can often suffer from overheating issues. Be careful about this when deciding to enter into an engagement; if it becomes necessary to reduce throttle and cool the engine in the midst of a turning- or energy-based engagement, there may be an opportunity for the enemy to gain the upper hand.

==== Specific enemies worth noting ====

* Heavy bombers - Although the Spitfire Mk IIa is armed with 8 guns, they are only 7.7 mm in calibre. So, it can be difficult to destroy heavy fighters, attackers, and especially bombers. It is likely that long bursts will be necessary to destroy such targets, and that gives time for enemy turret gunners to shoot back. Luckily, most bombers at this tier are not defended by turrets from all angles. Try to plan attack runs so that you don't fly in the enemy's line of fire.
* Bf 109s can do tremendous amounts of damage if you don't watch out. They have quite good turning performance and their energy retention is excellent with a skilled pilot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Eight 7.7 mm machine guns provide great anti-fighter power
* Great turn rate
* Good roll rate at low speed
* Great rate of climb
* Decent armour, a front 38 mm glass and rear 4-7 mm steel plates

'''Cons:'''

* Machine guns only effective in continuous bursts and only on short range
* Ammo can run out quickly in prolonged, uncontrolled bursts
* Quick kills against large bombers are difficult
* Machine guns cannot penetrate heavily armoured targets
* Bad high altitude performance
* Roll rate stiffens dramatically at ~350 km/h
* Pulling negative G's and rolling the plane ([[Realistic Battles|Realistic]]/[[Simulator Battles|simulator]] only) can cause the carburettor (engine) to fail quickly
* Terrible water radiator forces you to keep on 90% throttle 
* No combat nor take-off flaps

The Supermarine Spitfire was a British fighter which served with various nations from the late 1930s up into the 1950s. It was a single-engine, all-metal, low-wing monoplane with retractable landing gear. Various modifications served as fighters, interceptors, high-altitude fighters, fighter-bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. A total of some 20,300 Spitfires of all types were built during the war, including two-seater trainers.

In the summer of 1939, an early Spitfire Mk I was fitted with the new Rolls Royce Merlin XII engine, which had a higher output of 1175 HP and was fitted with a Coffman engine starter instead of the previous Merlin's electrical starter system. This, combined with the Rotol variable pitch propeller which had been used on many Spitfire Mk Is would now form the powerplant of the new Spitfire Mk II, although some production models used the De Havilland propeller. The Mk II was some 10-11 km/h (6-7 mph) faster than the later Spitfire Mk I, but still slower than the original Spitfires before a series of modifications increased the aircraft's weight. As with the Mk I, the Spitfire Mk II was produced with either eight machine guns as the Spitfire Mk IIA, or two 20 mm cannons and four machine guns as the Mk IIb. The earlier problems with cannon fitted to the Mk IB had now been solved by introducing a belt feed system to the weapon to replace the earlier drum, turning the cannon on its side and fitting a blister on the wing to house the new mechanism.

920 Spitfire Mk IIs entered service; 750 Mk IIA and 170 MK IIB, although fighters used in the air-sea rescue role were later designated Mk IIC. The Spitfire II quickly replaced the Spitfire I, with the older variant being relegated to use in Operational Training Units. By April 1941, RAF Fighter Command had completed re-equipping with the Mk II, although this too would soon be replaced by the Mk V.
