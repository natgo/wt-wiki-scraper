== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The plane served in the Israeli Air Force from 1948 to the 1950s, bought from Czechoslovakia alongside other aircraft to increase their capabilities. The plane fought during the Israeli-Arab War of 1948 in all sorts of missions, from escorts to close air support.

Introduced along with the initial Israeli air tree in [[Update "Winged Lions"]], the Spitfire Mk IXc is an excellent dogfighter with its wing-mounted guns. It fits 2 x 20 mm Hispano cannons with 4 x 7.7 mm MGs that share similar muzzle velocity, making it easier to aim with tracer belts in the MGs and air or ground target belts in the Hispanos. The plane is more effective as a dogfighter, capable of outmanoeuvring most aircraft in air battles while also retaining enough ground armament to destroy almost any vehicle with the right aim and destroying light vehicles with ease

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Spitfire Mk IXc has excellent handling in air combat with outstanding manoeuvrability and agility at speeds above 350 km/h. However, it lacks the cruising speed and acceleration of others around its BR, losing speed easily in turns. It excels however in climb rate, reaching high altitudes with no problem compared to other similar BR fighters.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 38 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen in front of the Pilot
* 3 mm Steel - Steel plate on top of fuel tanks
* 4 mm Steel - Steel plate on pilot's seat. Behind pilot is another 6-7 mm steel plate
* 3 mm Steel - Steel plates around ammunition and guns
* 1 mm - Steel plate over central fuel tanks

Note that one of the central fuel tanks (the one below the 1 mm steel plate) is not self-sealing, and thus a hit on this tank may result in severe fuel leaks

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Pilots should prioritize "Radiator", "Compressor" and engine power upgrades to counter the poor cruising speed. However, the most important modifications are the Hispano upgrades, because these will overheat and thus jam with ease until the 1942 upgrade is installed. It is still recommended to push for the 1943 upgrade however.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (120 rpg = 240 total)
* 4 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 1,400 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AN-M57 (250 lb)|Flz.-Rakete Oerlikon}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 250 lb AN-M57 bombs (500 lb total)
* 2 x 250 lb AN-M57 bombs + 16 x Flz.-Rakete Oerlikon rockets (500 lb total)
* 16 x Flz.-Rakete Oerlikon rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The most common and dangerous opponents will be Bf 109s and P-51s due to their superior speed and acceleration especially at altitudes above 5 km when the Spitfire loses significant engine power. A better alternative is fighting at around 3-4 km, however, at this BR fighters like the Fw 190 and P-47s will outrun you but not outturn the Spitfire. However, your good climb rate means that getting to 4 km is faster compared to other planes like the ones mentioned earlier.

Pilots should use their superior agility to lure boom and zoom fighters to lower altitudes (around 3-4 km) and force them into a turnfight in which the Spitfire excels. Note that to initiate a turnfight pilots should be flying at 350-400 km/h, this is due to low energy retention, and thus prolonged fights with enemies should be avoided, especially if these enemies initiate the fight at high speed. The only planes that will consistently outturn you are all models of the [[A6M (Family)|A6M "Zero"]] and the [[A7M (Family)|A7M "Reppu"]].

Head-ons should be avoided due to the guns being wing-mounted and far from the centre of the plane, and they function better at close-mid range (up to 600 m) with 300-400 m of convergence. Hits at enemies flying straight are hard without good aiming, thus the best way to deal with foes is in a dogfight when the wing-mounted guns become a benefit.

The engine is known for overheating and this should be controlled by manually opening the radiator and reducing the throttle if necessary. The Spitfire requires knowledge and trigger discipline, but even with that, Hispanos have mediocre damage. Going for bombers without good aiming is not advised, however, when fighting them, attack from below to avoid the defensive turrets and go for the engines to set them on fire. Catching bombers will not be an issue with the excellent climb rate of the Spitfire.

Ground RB should be avoided, as the Hispanos lack the penetration to knock out light tanks or SPAAs and ground ordnance options are lacklustre. However, good aiming with the rockets may result in a good amount of destructions against light and medium targets. Pilots can also use the Spitfire to clear the skies when the enemy has complete air supremacy.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good roll rate and manoeuvrability at low speed
* Good low-altitude performance
* Larger ammo supply of 120 rpg for the 20 mm cannons
* Machine gun ammo pool of 350 rpg, good for inexperienced pilots
* Similar muzzle velocity between the MGs and the cannons making it easier to aim
* Amazing climb rate when upgraded

'''Cons:'''

* Poor cannon performance when stock (lack of accuracy and jamming)
* Poor damage output of the MGs
* Poor high altitude performance (above 5,000 m)
* Poor acceleration
* Roll rate compression ~400 km/h
* Prone to fires and not all fuel tanks are self-sealing

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In 1948, Israel purchased ~50 Spitfires from Czechoslovakia, at a cost of $23,000 per unit. The first aircraft were introduced to Israel in what was known as "Operation Velvetta", specifically in Velvetta 1 and Velvetta 2, which consisted in these planes being flown from Czechoslovakia to Israel with stops to refuel.

These planes would be used most during the 1948 Israeli-Arab War, mainly by the 101 Squadron of the IAF. A few Spitfires were ready to participate in "Operation Yoav" in 1948 and were crucial in the early stages of the war. They filled a variety of roles, escorting B-17 and Beaufighter bombers, supporting ground forces, as well as flying air patrols and air reconnaissance.
