=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
;Armour plates
* 38 mm (66°) Bulletproof glass - Frontal windscreen
* 4 mm Steel - Pilot's seat
* 6-7 mm Steel - Plates behind the pilot
* 3 mm Steel - Plate on top of the non-sealing fuel tank
* 3 mm Steel - Plates around the wing ammunition

;Modules
* Critical components located at the front of aircraft (fuel, pilot, engine, controls)
* The top fuel tank is not self-sealing but the bottom fuel tank is
* Liquid cooling systems are located at each wing root and the oil cooling system is under the engine

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (120 rpg = 240 total)
* 4 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 1,400 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!--''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->
Like most Spitfires, the {{PAGENAME}}'s strength lies in its rate of climb and turn rate.

Generally use the 20 minute charge in Air Realistic Battles, since the engine usually consumes enough when using the emergency power. Climb at between 20 and 25 degrees.

The biggest threats you will have will be other Spitfires, which there will be many considering that a possible opponent nation the {{PAGENAME}} can fight is Great Britain, as well as premium variants in America and Israel tech tree (though the latter also has two normal versions as well). Another nation to be cautious around is Japan, which have fighters like the Ki-84, N1K, and J2M that could take on a Spitfire pilot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very agile like all Spitfires
* Good climb rate
* Very good acceleration
* Can out turn anything except for the Zeros

'''Cons:'''

* Slightly slower than the British and American Spitfires
* Cannons tend to overheat
* Can't take damage very well
* Roll rate at high speeds is terrible
* Has the average Mk. II Hispano cannons (called Hisparkos for a reason)
* No access to suspended armaments for combines battles

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
