<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 38 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit front.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 8 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 2,800 total)
  The Spitfire has a relatively good ammo count but the 4-digit ammo can be deceiving, since there are 8 guns on the aircraft. These should be primarily used against aircraft but can also be used as last resort to attack light or non-armoured ground targets, usually with stealth or universal belts. The job should be left to dedicated gun platforms like the Hurricanes and the Hellcats.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Combat tactics
The Spitfire Mk.IIa Venture I is an excellent low to medium altitude dogfighter. Lacking a supercharger, it shouldn't be used at high altitudes. In Air RB, it's best to climb to around 3,500-4,000 m (11,500-13,200 ft) where the Merlin XII engine performs optimally. After climbing, release WEP and reduce throttle to below 95% to cool the engine until you've found a target. When engaging opponents, diving should be carefully executed to avoid speeds of 450 km/h (280 mph) or greater, where control surfaces begin to suddenly stiffen. In combat, the light airframe and powerful engine provides a respectable rate of climb and an incredibly tight turning circle, combined with its eight browning machine guns, it is capable of eliminating enemy targets in short, controlled bursts. Poor weapon management will deplete your 2,800 rounds of ammunition quickly because individually, the machine guns are not very powerful. Concentrate and aim for the engine, cockpit or wings where your bullets will be most efficient at destroying vital components, such as wing spars or control surfaces.

Defensively, it's most susceptible to experienced Bf 109 pilots who know not to engage early model Spitfires in turning engagements. When forced in an energy fight or outnumbered, reduce the altitude of your opponents and fly towards your team. Use your roll rate and tight turning radius to avoid enemy fire whenever possible. The plane is capable shaking enemy fire due to its nimbleness. If no teammates are around, force the enemy to be low and slow, use your superior turn and roll-rate with flaps to get the edge. This includes against Japanese aircraft. Zeroes are the only contemporary capable of turning with this Spitfire, use your flaps and manage your engine throttle carefully, rolling scissors is an excellent manoeuvre to get the edge against light Japanese fighters.

Landing the Spitfire Mk.IIa Venture I is easy, the plane doesn't like to give up speed easily, so roll 90 degrees left and right banking low and hard to reduce speed. Once around 200 km/h (125 mph), deploy your landing gear to perform a fast landing. Flaps are unnecessary unless making an emergency landing.

;Enemies worth noting

- Zeroes: They can outmanoeuvre the Spitfire in a turnfight.
- Bf 109: They can inflict tremendous damage if you don't watch out. They have quite good turning performance and their energy retention exceeds that of the Spitfire.
- Heavy Bombers: Although the Spitfire Mk IIa is armed with 8 guns, they are only 7.7 mm in calibre. So, it can be difficult to destroy heavy fighters, attackers, and especially bombers. It is likely that long bursts will be necessary to destroy such targets, and that gives time for enemy turret gunners to shoot back. Luckily, most bombers at this tier are not defended by turrets from all angles. Try to plan attack runs so that you don't fly in the enemy's line of fire.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Eight 7.7 mm machine guns provide great anti-fighter power
- Great turn rate
- Good roll rate at low speed
- Better-than-average top speed
- Great rate of climb
- Better engine power than [[Spitfire Mk Ia]]
- Decent amount of armour, a front 38 mm glass and rear 4-7 mm steel plates

'''Cons:'''

- Machine guns only effective if the target is hit in continuous bursts
- Machine gun armament lacks the long range hitting power of cannons
- Ammo can run out quickly in prolonged, uncontrolled bursts
- Quick kills against large bombers without a pilot snipe is difficult, prolonged engagements expose the Spitfire to the defensive gunners
- Machine guns cannot penetrate heavily armoured targets
- Bad high altitude performance
- Roll rate stiffens dramatically at ~350 km/h
- Pulling negative G's and rolling the plane ([[Realistic Battles|Realistic]]/[[Simulator Battles|simulator]] only) can cause the carburettor (engine) to fail

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
The Supermarine Spitfire was a British fighter which served with various nations from the late 1930s up into the 1950s. It was a single-engine, all-metal, low-wing monoplane with retractable landing gear. Various modifications served as fighters, interceptors, high-altitude fighters, fighter-bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. A total of some 20,300 Spitfires of all types were built during the war, including two-seater trainers.

In the summer of 1939, an early Spitfire Mk I was fitted with the new Rolls Royce Merlin XII engine, which had a higher output of 1175 HP and was fitted with a Coffman engine starter instead of the previous Merlin's electrical starter system. This, combined with the Rotol variable pitch propeller which had been used on many Spitfire Mk Is would now form the powerplant of the new Spitfire Mk II, although some production models used the De Havilland propeller. The Mk II was some 6-7 mph faster than the later Spitfire Mk I, but still slower than the original Spitfires before a series of modifications increased the aircraft's weight. As with the Mk I, the Spitfire Mk II was produced with either eight machine guns as the Spitfire Mk IIA, or two 20 mm cannon and four machine guns as the Mk IIb. The earlier problems with cannon fitted to the Mk IB had now been solved by introducing a belt feed system to the weapon to replace the earlier drum, turning the cannon on its side and fitting a blister on the wing to house the new mechanism.

920 Spitfire Mk IIs entered service; 750 Mk IIA and 170 MK IIB, although fighters used in the air-sea rescue role were later designated Mk IIC. The Spitfire II quickly replaced the Spitfire I, with the older variant being relegated to use in Operational Training Units. By April 1941, RAF Fighter Command had completed re-equipping with the Mk II, although this too would soon be replaced by the Mk V.
