== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The clipped wing configuration for the Spitfire Mk IX was introduced in the mid-late 1940s to increase manoeuvrability and improve roll rate at lower altitudes, at the cost of less lift. This was due to a shorter surface area, that generated less lift but was also more aerodynamic and less air was travelling around the fuselage

Introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]], the Spitfire Mk IX (CW) has very good handling and excellent agility. It may lack the ground ordnance common in other fighters such as the P-51s and Fw 190s but offers some of the best acceleration, climb rate and agility for its BR. While not the fastest, its good climb rate makes it capable of reaching high altitudes sooner than most planes which, combined with its agility, makes it a very deadly opponent when it has the speed or altitude advantage.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The performance of the Spitfire is excellent as long as it has the speed. While it has good acceleration at low speeds, it loses speed faster than planes at a similar BR, which is normal since it has much better turn rate than other fighters. It also has very good climb rate to take good positioning at the start of the match. However, its engine is prone to overheating when WEP is used constantly.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (135 rpg = 270 total)
* 2 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (260 rpg = 520 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Spitfire plays in a very aggressive role in most situations. While it is not the fastest or the highest in the match, it has the capabilities to win dogfights against most opponents. Common things to avoid are being stuck with less than 300 km/h since this fighter is especially sluggish at low speeds and always having an altitude advantage in most fights.

Even though these are common things to worry about in most fighters, the Spitfire Mk IX CW loses speed very quickly, and thus precise shots are needed in dogfights, since prolonged fights would make you vulnerable to other enemy fighters in the area. The altitude is also very important, because the diving speed of the Spitfire is not the best, and having altitude is important to regain speed when necessary or to attack unsuspecting pilots in the middle of a fight.

Common strategies to use the Spitfire Mk IX CW are in a support or frontline role. In support roles climbing is the way to go, to intervene during the most important moments of the game and ensuring the safety of allied aircraft fleeing the battlefield to repair, while also intercepting enemy aircraft retreating to their airfield. As a frontline fighter sticking with your team is important; because the Spitfire isn't capable of sustaining prolonged dogfights, having allies around you is important since they can distract other aircraft that may attack you while in a fight.

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
During late WW2, the Clipped Wing design was a common upgrade for the Mk IX and Mk XVI variants of the Spitfire. According to test flights by the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford using the Spitfire Mk V, this configuration offered better speeds at altitudes below 10,000 ft and slightly better speeds around 25,000 ft. However it provided much better acceleration and agility overall. For pilots, this modification also meant a better view around the aircraft, because sometimes the large and wide wings of the Spitfire blocked incoming fighters or obstructed the pilot's vision during ground attacks.

Being fitted to the Spitfire Mk V variants, the Clipped Wing was also given to the Mk IX and Mk XVI due to high altitude sorties being less and less common and ground attack missions where being prioritized due to the mediocre state of the Luftwaffe. These variants of the Spitfire were sometimes modified in different nations such as Czechoslovakia, since it was a cheap modification that gave the Spitfire more years as a competent fighter in low altitudes and ground attack missions
