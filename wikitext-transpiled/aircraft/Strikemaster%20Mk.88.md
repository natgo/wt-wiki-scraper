== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XIII, "Tropical Storm"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Various secondary weapon loadouts
* Small profile makes for a small target
* High top speed

'''Cons:'''

* Mediocre manoeuvrability
* Slow acceleration
* Small calibre guns

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== Devblog History ===
The concept of the Strikemaster light attack jet came to fruition after the successful conversion of the Jet Provost trainer aircraft by some foreign operators into a strike aircraft, ready to use in combat against insurgents. The British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) began to equip the aircraft with a more powerful engine, front-facing machine guns, and weapon mounts for export sales, so that even countries with modest economies could afford an inexpensive attack aircraft. The Mk.88 was specifically designed for the New Zealand Air Force — with the first aircraft of this modification being delivered in 1972, which remained in service until 1993. The Strikemaster set a world record as the most frequently ordered aircraft for export, and was in service with the air forces of 10 foreign countries!
