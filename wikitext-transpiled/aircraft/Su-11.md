<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Su-11 can easily be one of the best aircraft at its battle rating. Its primary strength is the excellent acceleration, compared to contemporary jets. It has excellent energy retention (ER) and average to good manoeuvring energy retention (MER).

In general, the best tactic with the Su-11 is to play to its strengths, as with any vehicle; In the Su-11's case, particularly its acceleration and ER can be exploited. Take off from the airfield, and level out quickly. Don't bother gaining initial altitude, jet engines particularly early jet engines, accelerate better at sea level. Turn at least 30 degrees away from the center of the map, and build up speed. It is recommended to build up to about 725 km/h - 805 km/h (450 mph to 500 mph), then place the aircraft into a 20-30 degree zoom climb (steady-state climbing is possible in this aircraft, but like most early jets, zoom climbing is most efficient).

This will take the Su-11 well above 3.5 km, usually closer to 5 km. Dive on unsuspecting enemies, particularly aircraft that don't manoeuvre well, and once they are destroyed, begin a 20-30 degree zoom climb to regain your lost altitude. The energy retention is excellent, and you can typically regain all your lost altitude, if not gain on top of it. Usually enemies on the Su-11 tail can be out-accelerated, which causes most players to lose interest in engaging and break off the chase, even if their aircraft's top speed is higher than the Su-11.

Manoeuvrability is average, but certainly not poor. The Su-11's manoeuvring energy retention is excellent, If forced to dogfight and the opponent vehicle has similar manoeuvrability, simply drain them of their energy with long, sweeping movements.

While the Su-11's armament packs a punch, excellent marksmanship is an absolute necessity, given the low ammo pool of only 200 23 mm rounds and 40 37 mm rounds. In addition it has a relatively low rate of fire (on both cannons). The rounds are also relatively low velocity (especially the 37 mm round). However, the rounds are extremely powerful, with the 37 mm round able to destroy heavy bombers with a couple of well placed hits, and the 23 mm round able to destroy lighter aircraft with 1-2 hits. The best option is to get as close as possible before opening fire to ensure that the enemy plane gets knocked out.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent manoeuvrability
* Good acceleration for an early jet
* Fast aircraft
* Heavy armament
* Excellent energy retention
'''Cons:'''

* Engines overheat quickly at 100% power
* Low ammo pool
* Low rate of fire, relatively low velocity (particularly the 37 mm) cannons

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Su-9 was an early Soviet jet fighter built using knowledge and parts derived from the German Me 262 jet fighter.

The Su-11 was a project in 1946 to mount Yakovlev versions of the RD-10F engines in the Su-9 jet fighter. After testing the Su-9 in the wind tunnel, it was found that engines mounted in the wings rather than underneath reduced drag and that the wingtips also needed a redesign. As such, the Su-11 received a completely redesigned wing and before completion it was also received the Lyulka TR-1 turbojet engines. The two engines produced 2,865 lbf of thrust each for 5930 lbf of thrust total.

The Su-11 first flew on 28 May 1947, demonstrating a maximum speed of 940 km/h at sea level. Unfortunately, the design had a bad longitudinal stability and even modifications to the wing engine nacelles did not solve the issue. Because of these issues, the Su-11 programme was cancelled and did not enter production.
