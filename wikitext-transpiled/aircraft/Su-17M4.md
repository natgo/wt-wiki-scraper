== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

The Su-17M4 is a later model of the swing-wing "Fitter" attacker family. Compared to the previous [[Su-17M2]], it uses a revised airframe shared by the [[Su-22M3]] with a drooping forward fuselage and a noticeable hump behind the cockpit. The flight performance remains practically unchanged, still enjoying good speed and the versatility afforded by its swing wings. In-game, its most notable improvements over other models are the ability to use all-aspect [[R-60M]] infrared missiles for air combat and a large supply of 268 countermeasures for self defense. It also enjoys the widest suite of ground attack weapons, featuring the S-25 heavy rocket seen on the Su-22M3 and the [[Kh-29T]] TV-guided missile seen on the [[MiG-27M]]/[[MiG-27K|K]]. Although the Su-17M4 is more primitive than the MiG-27K and cannot fulfill the same long-range CAS role afforded by the Flogger's advanced targeting systems, this Sukhoi is still a robust strike platform with plenty of hardpoints and a large arsenal.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In air battles, the Su-17M4 will suffer against most targets it comes across as the plane itself is an attacker. You are not manoeuvrable and engaging in dogfights is strongly discouraged. Due to the presence of radar missiles, the best way to play the plane in RB is to be a support fighter, trying to stay away from the action before coming in either from the side or on top of a furball/enemy while everyone is distracted, using your R-60Ms to your advantage. Your RWR will be useful and if you do receive a radar lock, it is best to notch and/or try to run away from the enemy, hoping to deter him from attacking you.  Head-on attacks are usually not advised as while the R-60Ms are all aspect, they can be easily flared, and it's better to keep them for a more useful situation, unless it's a last ditch effort. Bombing bases can be done but flying directly straight in to the map is risky. On bigger maps such as EC matches, it may be a good idea to take some ground ordnance, and hit ground targets to bleed the enemy tickets, as being a pure "fighter" will usually end in a bad situation.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good overall turn rate and energy retention, can hold 800-1,000 km/h in turns with wings fully un-swept and afterburner deployed
* Strong elevator authority, can pull out of low-skimming attack runs with no problem
* Very large amount of countermeasures: 256 x small and 12 x large countermeasures is more than enough to keep missiles off of you
* NR-30 cannons are very powerful, can also mount up to 4 x GSh-23L gunpods for extra burst mass
* Excellent loadout options for both AAMs and ground ordnance alike
* Can act as a very strong supporting fighter with 6 x R-60M AAMs and sweep wing

'''Cons:'''

* Roll rate and overall manoeuvrability are poor at speeds below 500 km/h
* With wings fully swept-forward, the maximum speed is limited to approximately Mach 0.8 at sea level otherwise the wings will rip
* No semi-automatic option for managing wing-sweep, only full-manual or automatic wing-sweep settings
* Gigantic target when wings are unswept
* Payload is somewhat low, at only 4,000 kg of bombs
* Cannot carry GBUs or R-13 AAMs like the MiG-27s
