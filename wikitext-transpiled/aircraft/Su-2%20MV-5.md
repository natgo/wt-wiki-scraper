== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Versatile strike aircraft
- Manoeuvrable and responsive
- Internal bomb bay reduces drag

'''Cons:'''

- Only 1 x 7.62 mm defensive MG
- Lightly-armoured and operating at low altitude, easy target for enemy fighters

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

OKB Sukhoi BB-1 (Su-2) "Ivanov" Short-Range Bomber with M-88 engine

In December of 1940, the BB-1 was renamed the Su-2, after designer Pavel Osipovich Sukhoi, and began to be constructed with the M-88 engine.

This engine, developed in the Tumansky OKB, was an upgrade of the M-87. The M-88 retained the original design scheme (air-cooled, radial, 14-cylinder) and had a takeoff power capacity of 1,100 hp.

However, unreliable operation caused serious problems. The M-88 was continually suffering from piston burnouts, shaking, and increased oil consumption. Oil splatters leaking from the engine would splash on the cabin's transparent bottom, under the navigator, making it more difficult to aim bombs. In addition, the decision to replace the plexiglass canopy with celluloid was a mistake, as the new material quickly lost its transparency, reducing visibility. Nevertheless, the crew did appreciate the warm, closed cabin.

Some of the Su-2s were equipped with rockets. Instead of bombs under the wings, five unguided PC-82 or PC-132 rockets could be installed in each location.

A new variant of the Su-2 was released in early 1941, featuring the M-88B engine. This modification improved the aircraft's performance. The oil cooler was moved to the midsection and the shape of the hood and suction pipe were changed. The plane's armament was somewhat reduced to facilitate construction. Instead of four ShKAS guns in the winds, two guns were installed, with 850 rounds of ammunition per gun. The bulky MB-5 tail turret was replaced with a TSS-1 turret, with a ShKas 7.62 mm machine gun and 900 rounds of ammunition. However, the turret suffered from a number of problems, including a limited angle of fire and difficulty firing when in an air stream. In the spring of 1941, 250 aircraft were produced with the TSS-1. Afterwards, the MB-5 was used. Bomb and rocket payloads remained unchanged.

The Red Army Air Force began to use the Su-2 in combat during the second half of 1940. By the beginning of World War II on June 22, 1941, 213 Su-2s were in service.
