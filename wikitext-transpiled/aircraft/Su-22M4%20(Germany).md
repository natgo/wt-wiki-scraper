== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the 1980s, the Soviet Union and its allies began adopting upgraded variants of the Su-17 fighter-bomber, which was exported as the "Su-22" for Soviet allies. The East German air force would receive 48 of the latest Su-22M4 fighter bomber, along with 8 of the twin-seat [[Su-22UM3K (Germany)|Su-22UM-3K]] trainer aircraft. The German Su-22s would serve as a frontline strike aircraft for the Warsaw Pact countries, and as a primary line of attack during a possible war with NATO. The Su-22M4s would remain in East German service until the re-unification of Germany, when almost all of the German Su-22s were either scrapped or sold off as they were incompatible with NATO hardware and standards. Only a few Su-22M4s were kept and repainted in Luftwaffe liveries for briefly serving as evaluation and testing aircraft.

Introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]] as a continuation of the fighter-bomber line, following its weaker brother, the Su-22UM3K, in the tech tree, the '''Su-22M4''' is the top-range Su-17/22 model, and is nearly identical to the [[Su-17M4]] in the Soviet aircraft tree. This aircraft is characterized by its upgrades over its predecessor in the tree, mainly in that it can carry advanced guided ordnance such TV guided weapons in addition to the familiar laser guided ordnance. The aircraft is also no slouch in the air-to-air department either, now carrying over 250 countermeasures and the all-aspect [[R-60MK]] missiles, delivered swiftly to the enemy's location using the upgraded engine and avionics. All in all, this aircraft serves as a true titan of multirole performance for the aircraft of the German top ranks, excelling at both air to air and air to ground tasks, making it a force to be reckoned with in mixed battles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Air RB ===
The useable loadouts can vary significantly depending on the opponents faced in the battle. Generally, any loadout carrying 8 FAB-500s is optimal as it can destroy exactly two bases. The R-60MKs are suboptimal in most scenarios due to how susceptible they are to flares, but excel when launched in "melee" (as in: from behind, no more than 800 m away), as they tend to fly past the flares and still hit their target. That said, the Su-22M4 should not be used for dogfighting, instead you should engage distracted or vulnerable targets.

A rare but entertaining scenario is when the Su-22M4 meets subsonic aircraft like the [[A-10A Late]] or any [[Su-25 (Family)|Su-25 variant]] as the Kh-29T can in fact be used to engage them and can cause panic as the enemy pilot sees that their flares have no effect.

=== Ground RB ===
The Su-22M4's performance as close air support is as to be expected. The generous rocket load is recommended as even the FAB-500 bombs need relatively high precision to be effective. The laser-guided weapons are quite underwhelming as the plane lacks any form of advanced fire control to effectively target anything smaller than a cargo ship.

Where the jet really shines is with the Kh-29T, originally designed against ships, this missile can obliterate any ground target. When spawned in, immediately begin climbing at a steep angle and switch to missile view, within a few seconds you should have a clear view of the battlefield. Center the crosshair on a target and simply hold the launch button, the missile will fire the moment it acquires a lock.

However, you should be mindful of what you engage.

'''Do:'''

* Enemy anti-air: The [[Pantsir-S1]] especially is a treat for the missile's guidance system due to its large rectangular shape.
* Targets far from cover: Enemies who think they are safe behind hills are especially good targets.
* Helicopters: Although they can occasionally dodge the missile, it is reasonably effective while keeping you out of their AA missile range.

'''Don't:'''

* Enemies under fire: While much faster than the [[AGM-65 (Family)|AGM-65]], it still takes time for the missile to reach the target, and them deploying smoke or being destroyed will waste it.
* Enemies moving to cover: The missile cannot re-acquire a lock and will self-destruct if it loses the target.
* Targets that are off-bore: Although the missile has impressive manoeuvrability, it still has limits and the plane's nose should be pointing towards the target at ranges closer than 6 km.
