== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Dance of Dragons"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Loads of air to ground munitions, with abilities to carry 3 of the heavy FAB-1500s and its guided versions
* In-built targeting system with laser tracking
* Highest burst mass firing gun in game

*

'''Cons:'''

* Heavy, hence not recommended in prolonged dogfights, especially after the first turn
* No thermals in targeting system
* Only radar is ground-track radar, which is scan only and cannot be adjusted at all
* Mediocre acceleration
* While MAWs are useful, they are very unreliable; giving warnings sometimes when no missiles are fired and sometimes no warnings when missiles are actually fired at you
