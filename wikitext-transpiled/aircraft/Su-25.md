== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The Su-25 is known for its survivability, anecdotally being able to take a few missile hits without suffering any damage compromising its airworthiness, though this ability is inconsistent and should not be relied upon.

256 flares/chaff launched two of each at a time provide the Su-25 with the chance to evade missiles, which should be the primary form of defense. A lack of afterburner increases flare effectiveness, only very modern missiles such as aim-9L are able to track the aircraft from behind.

Chaff only defends against radar locks from behind the aircraft. Sometimes enemy radar-guided missiles can be shot down with R-60M, allowing the Su-25 to engage surface-to-air missile systems in a head-on such as FlaRakPz1, XM975, Roland 1, and Lvrbv 701, as they only have two missiles each.

The aircraft remains somewhat controllable upon loss of tail control, wingtips, or an engine.

The fuel tanks are self-sealing.

The aircraft has an engine fire extinguishing system, unlockable as a modification.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Su-25 is best suited for low altitude attack runs on enemy ground units. Its multitude of air-to-ground weapons as well as its good survivability allow it to perform CAS role in Ground Realistic Battles very well. In Air Realistic Battles, it still is a force to be reckoned with in terms of ground attack, being able to erase a huge chunk of enemy points if left alone. The large quantity of unguided rockets allows for mass destruction of most ground targets. Additionally, the GSh-30-2 cannon will easily rip through light, medium and heavy tanks from the sides or the rear, the same applies to light pillboxes if aimed at the top. The aircraft can also use its bombs for striking strategic bombing points. In terms of air-to-air combat, the Su-25 can utilize its excellent R-60M missiles for self-defence, being able to lock onto incoming enemy planes from any direction. Keep in mind that as long as you maintain your speed, you might keep up in a dogfight with an opponent but after a few turns the aircraft will bleed a lot of speed and become very sluggish.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Effective offensive armament, the GSh-30-2 cannon has very high shell velocity and good hitting power
- Well armoured airframe, can survive a lot of damage
- Decent acceleration
- Access to all-aspect R-60M missiles with great tracking
- Generous amount of countermeasures
- Wide array of suspended armament and possibility to create custom loadouts

'''Cons:'''

- Low max speed
- Big aircraft, easy to hit
- Large turn radius
- Compression at higher speeds
- Can rip its wings in level flight if not careful and in sustained high speed turns

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
