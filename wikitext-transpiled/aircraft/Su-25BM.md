== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}'''* (unified NATO codename: Frogfoot) is the Belarusian modification of the [[Su-25]] performed by the JSC "558 Aircraft Repair Plant" (Авиационный ремонтный завод; ARZ) in Baranovichi, Belarus for the Kazakh Air Defense Forces, mainly focusing on the modernization of the cockpit with modern avionics and new ECM equipment for the modern battlefield. According to the news in 2016, Kazakhstan sought Belarus for upgrades to their remaining fleet of Su-25. The aircraft were sent to the 558 ARZ for upgrades, trialled in mid-2017, and returned for service in Kazakhstan in 2018.

Introduced during [[Update "La Royale"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8384-event-summer-extreme-en|2023 Summer Extreme]] event, the Su-25BM featured new avionics in the cockpit with a new HUD and MFDs replacing most analogue gauges, as well as new PS-25 weapons control system for new weaponry like the infamous R-73 (AA-11 Archer) AAM and all previous air-to-ground ordnance ranging from GP bombs up to TV-guided bombs and laser-guided AGMs, enhancing the overall combat capabilities of the otherwise obsolete Frogfoots.

<small>*Note: the code BM was first used by target-drone tow plane (Buksirovshchik Misheney); but it is likely the abbreviation of Belarus Modernizirovannyi</small> <small>(Belarusian Modernization) in this case.</small>

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
For long-time players of the Su-25(K), the overall flight performance is very similar; for new players, do not underestimate the airframe of such an attacker. The R-95SH engine can quickly push the jet up to 960 km/h before structural failure in level flights even at high payload. Once players have used up all their A2G ordnances or brought only AAMs, the straight wing also allows the Su-25BM to turn with some heavy jets at its rank. However, due to the nature of being a subsonic attacker at top tier, enemy jets tend not to have dogfights especially with a Frogfoot even though it is a heavy target. Be sure not to be the first to enter the battlefield as there is a high likelihood for multiple enemies seeking out the relatively easy prey that is the Su-25BM.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Su-25BM's airframe is strong, able to take hits on critical parts of the aircraft and still make it back to base. The Su-25BM has plenty of armour around the cockpit and inside the fuselage, with bulletproof glass being the main protection of the pilot.

256 countermeasures allow the aircraft to avoid IR and radar-guided missiles with ease. This, and the fact that the engines lack any type of afterburner/WEP, makes it hard for enemy missiles to follow the Su-25BM reliably. Only the more advanced missiles are able to get a good lock on the Su-25BM, and even then, manoeuvring after dropping 2 or 4 flares will be more than enough to avoid most of them.

Fuel tanks are self-sealing, which means that in case of any fuel tank fire, the fuel tank will be able to stop the fire most of the time. In case a fire happens inside the engine and not on a fuel tank, the Su-25BM also has EFS as a modification. This modification is capable of extinguishing any fire that's inside an engine, leaving the affected engine inoperable, but saving the airframe from further fire damage.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
As the modernized Su-25K of Eastern Bloc/CIS countries, players will get used to its performance very quickly if they owned other Frogfoots, enjoying the upgraded features of Su-25BM both at aerial combats and pounding ground targets at safer distance. Making Su-25BM a versatile jet at its tier.

==== Air - Heavy but Packs A punch ====
One thing players will soon notice is the identical airframe of early series of Su-25, not only it retains the identical engine from these jets, the airframe is still equally heavy. While the weight in this case is due to the extra protections around the cockpit, this might not be a good news to players of Su-25BM; the thrust of Su-25 can still push the jet to its structural limits even at level flight, if enemy fighters have intentions to take players out with different ordnances, chances are you could not make it out of the frontline without suffering severe damages. The 256 countermeasures can still make sure players can evade missiles, but at such speed, they will need extra launches to evade missiles. To say at least - taking an attacker as a fighter is never, ever a good idea, especially for such a heavy jet; but a good news for Su-25BM players is that it is also the first jet to officially introduce R-73 in game. In case of players coming too close to your radius at around 3 km, the all-aspect R-73 with high overload can make sure enemy jets will face their end quickly; it can also serve as a mean to deter enemies from taking you as the target. As long as the skies are clear from enemy jets, use your weapons of choice to earn extra incomes on ground AI targets or bases; the guns are powerful enough to gun down even MBTs with precise hits from higher angle of attack.

==== Ground - The Overwatcher ====
All the previous weaponries on Su-25 are available on the BM variant, thanks to the upgrade from Belarus, it can also use safer standoff weapons like KAB-500Kr or Kh-29T to take out high value targets; it will be a good idea to take out enemy SPAAs before heading for the battlefield. After these targets have been cleared, players can unleash unguided bombs and rockets to finish-off remaining ground vehicles and clearing the path for victory; if enemy jets think otherwise, the onboard IR AAMs could still make sure they have to think twice before heading for your team. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Mounts R-73 missiles, which are extremely effective
* Capable of equipping a large amount of air-to-ground armament
* Powerful chin-mounted GSh-30-2  autocannon
* Access to more advanced, fire and forget standoff A2G armaments
* Could take additional hits thanks to the well-protected airframe
* Integrated avionics for better awareness in SB battles

'''Cons:'''

* Has a relatively low top speed, capable of ripping its own wings in level flight
* Low ammo count for the 30 mm cannon
* Low manoeuvrability due to the weight and obsolete engine
* Inferior SPO-15 RWR with worse situational awareness to radar sources

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an abundance of ex-Soviet strategic weapons (ICBMs, MIRVs, nuclear weapons, and strategic bombers) scattered throughout the ex-socialist republics. One of them was Kazakhstan, which had already quit the Union by October 1990. They returned the 40 Tu-95MS (13 MS-16 and 27 MS-6 respectively; where 7 of them were dismantled in Kazakhstan due to poor condition) of the 79th Heavy Bomber Aviation Division which was stationed at Dolon Airbase to Russia in 1992, as well as 370 tactical missiles with nuclear warheads; this in turn became a deal between Kazakhstan and Russia that some of the units from the Turkmenistan Military District would be returned to Kazakhstan in 1995, as well as new units including 12 Su-25 and 2 Su-25UB. These 14 aircraft were assigned to the (602nd) Chimkent Air Base as part of the composition of the newly-born Kazakh ADF.

Due to the aging and already obsolete airframe for future battlefield, there was news that Kazakhstan Aviation Industry and Belarusian JSC "558 Aircraft Repair Plant" planned for upgrades for the 12 Kazakh Su-25 in June 2016 where these jets would sent to Baranovichi, Belarus for the upgrades.<ref>https://airrecognition.com/index.php/news/defense-aviation-news/global-news-2016/june/2733-kazakhstan-plans-to-upgrade-its-fleet-of-su-25-combat-aircraft.html</ref> The upgrades included (based on the details of Bulgarian upgrades):<ref>https://www.key.aero/article/depth-look-bulgarias-modernised-frogfoot-fleet</ref>

* SOI-25 integrated flight display systems with ILS-31ZhK HUD and two MFI-10 MFDs
* New SNS navigation systems compatible with GPS/GLONASS
* New digital computer
* PS-25 weapon system for more advanced missiles and better engage altitude
* Satellite-M2 jammer system
* SVR-2T and Tester-U3-2 FDR

These new jets was first tested in mid-2017 in Belarus and first batches of the upgraded jets were return to the Kazakh ADF by early 2018<ref>https://defence-blog.com/kazakhstan-receives-refurbed-su-25-ground-attack-aircraft/</ref>; all of them are likely to be operational at present; these jets also became the foundation of Su-25K upgrades of Eastern Bloc countries.

The default livery in-game represents 02 of the 602nd Airbase stationed at Chimkent, while the purchasable/unlockable livery represents No.32 of 116th Guards Assault Air Base and the event-limited livery represents White 246 of 22th ShtAB, Bulgarian Air Force.
