== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the early 1970s, it was noted that the Soviet Air Force's CAS capabilities were very underwhelming compared to their adversaries. The ground attack variants of the [[MiG-21PFM|MiG-21]] and [[MiG-23BN (Germany)|MiG-23]] lacked sufficient armour, cockpit visibility, and ground ordnance for heavy ground attack missions, whereas the [[Su-7 (Family)|Su-7]] and older variants of the [[Su-17M2|Su-17]] were deemed "obsolete" and did not meet the requirements of the Red Army. As a result, the Soviet Ministry of Defence announced a new design competition among its design bureaus, for a new heavy-weight subsonic dedicated attacker. In the end, of the promising designs of the Sukhoi T-8 and the Ilyushin IL-102, the Sukhoi design was chosen and ordered into production in 1978 as the "[[Su-25]]". The aircraft would enter production just in time to see service in the Soviet-Afghan War the following year. Shortly after it entered production, a slightly modified variant with cheaper/simpler electronics was devised for export, titled the Su-25K.

Introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]], the Su-25K is the export version of the base [[Su-25]] model, intended for Warsaw-Pact countries and overseas customers with minor internal differences in terms of certain equipment. Due to this similarity with its base model, the Su-25K plays in an almost completely identical manner. The aircraft is most remarkable in mixed battles, where its large amount of countermeasures, great armour around the pilot and engines, and plethora of guided and unguided ground ordnance (coupled with two [[R-60MK]] all aspect air-to-air missiles for self defence) makes it a true force to be reckoned with in Ground Realistic and Ground Simulator battles. The Su-25K is also no slouch either in air battles, due to its stable airframe, all aspect missiles, abundant countermeasures, powerful 30 mm cannon, and surprising agility when not loaded with the usual heavy ground-striking ordnance. All in all, the Su-25K is a very potent aircraft wherever it is used, and its premium earnings bonuses are a nice extra over its tech tree brother.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->Same as the base model in Soviet service, Su-25K is equipped with a pair of UMPO R-95SH non-afterburning turbofan engines on the sides of the airframe and is one of the last jets designed by Sukhoi with a straight wing. Since the Su-25K was designed as an attacker, it performs best at low altitude and taking it into high altitude engagements is not recommended. Another iconic feature of Su-25s are the extensive protection all-around for the pilot and critical components of the jet.  Although this adds to the survivability of the aircraft against smaller weapons, it also reduces the overall manoeuverability of the aircraft as a result of the added weight.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Su-25K is known for its survivability, anecdotally being able to take a few missile hits without suffering any damage compromising its airworthiness, though this ability is inconsistent and should not be relied upon. The airframe is able to sustain rear hits from missiles with a small warhead, especially the FIM-92 Stinger. Occasionally the Su-25K is able to sustain continued hits from Stingers and Roland 1s.

128 flares/chaff launched two of each at a time provide the Su-25K with the chance to evade missiles, which should be the primary form of defense. A lack of afterburner increases flare effectiveness and only more advanced missiles such as the AIM-9L at very short ranges are able to track the aircraft from behind through flares. Chaff will be able to decoy less advanced radar missiles but in order to defeat more advanced versions, chaff has to be deployed while notching.

The aircraft remains decently controllable upon loss of tail control, wingtips, or an engine. The aircraft remains near-fully controllable upon loss of the rudder and occasionally can fly without the vertical stabilizer.

The fuel tanks are self-sealing and the aircraft has an engine fire extinguishing system. A single section of fuel tank is protected by 18 mm of steel.

The cockpit is very well armoured. The pilot is protected on the front and sides by 24 mm of titanium alloy, the bottom and rear of the pilot is covered by 10 mm of titanium alloy. Additionally there is 57 mm thick bulletproof glass in the front of the cockpit.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Su-25K is a support plane. It is a slow plane compared to most other planes, therefore altitude is important since you are likely to Boom and Zoom. You need to look around constantly to prevent unexpected attacks. Your main worries will be planes like the A-5C or the F-5C. Those planes are fast and can dogfight you. Gain altitude and pick on unsuspecting targets. Your R-60MK missiles are very good but shooting them at 3 km distance will be the most efficient. You can also save your missiles if you're caught in a head-on, or you can spray your guns. If you see tough enemies which are alert of your presence, try engaging them first.
=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
As one of the export jets of Soviet Union then later Russia and Georgia ''(the Tbilisi Aircraft Plant)'', the Su-25K has been exported to every major continents of the world in different amounts with some victories against their enemies; with most of the users being Eurasian countries.

Records showed that Czechoslovakia, one of the Warsaw-Pact countries until late 1980s, received their batches of 36 Su-25Ks and 2 UBK trainers from Soviet Union in 1984 as the composition of the 30th Attack Air Regiment in Pardubice Airbase then later 1st Mixed Air Corps in 1990; after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the succeeding Czech Republic and Slovakia split their inventories with Czech receiving 2/3 (24 25Ks and an UBK) of these jets while Slovakia received the remaining ones in 1993. Both countries didn't used their Frogfoot in any combat operations or intended for any further service in respective air forces where Czech decommissioned their Frogfoot in December 2000 while Slovakia sold most of their Frogfoots to Armenia in mid-2000s.[http://www.airvectors.net/avsu25.html] [https://www.arrow-aviation.nl/cz_su25.html]
