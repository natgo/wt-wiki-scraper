== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
After the gradual decline of the post-Soviet economy in Russia, the [[Su-25T]] and its subsequent [[Su-39|TM]] modernizations were cancelled due to high costs. Instead, a more "affordable" modernization was ordered to be developed. Sukhoi OKB faced multiple delays in this project, mainly due to the merging of Sukhoi with multiple other manufacturers such as Mikoyan and Illyushin into the nationalized "UAC" (United Aircraft Corporation) in 2006 to save costs even further. Eventually, the first Su-25SMs started entering service gradually, with initial batches being older Su-25 airframes upgraded to the SM standard rather than newly built airframes. However, the SM upgrade package mainly focused on making the Su-25 "cheap" rather than modern, with most of the upgrades being tailored to extend the service life and increase reliability while dropping operational costs. It would not be until 2018 that the new '''Su-25SM3''' variant would enter service, being the first real "upgrade" to the modern Su-25 fleet. The SM3 featured the new SPO-150L "Pastel" radar warning receiver, along with an expanded countermeasures suite involving a new set of dispensers and the options for multiple ECM pods to be mounted. Since the [[Ka-50]]'s ''Shkval'' targeting system (as used on the Su-25T) was too expensive and outdated, the Klen-PS targeting system of the original Su-25 was replaced with the SOLT-25 thermal tracking sight, with up to 16x zoom. The Su-25SM3 would see trial by fire almost instantly after entering service, being deployed by the Russian VVS for ground strike missions during the intervention in the Syrian Civil War. Experience gained from combat in Syria resulted in the final set of upgrades to the SM3 standard; the addition of a PrNK-25SM-1 "Bars" targeting and navigation system, and an SVP-24 ballistic bombing computer.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a modern Soviet strike aircraft introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]]. While it seems to be a downgrade from the previous Su-25T at first due to the lower air-to-air missile count and lack of [[9K127 Vikhr]] ATGMs, the Su-25SM3 is far more than meets the eye. For starters, the Shkval laser sight was upgraded to the SOLT-25 thermal imaging and laser designator system, not only making this the only Su-25 with thermals but also the one with the largest zoom to its optics. Alongside that the Su-25SM3 gets an upgraded amount of countermeasures, a full 360-degree Missile Approach Warning (MAW) System, which warns you against any incoming threats (including IR missiles and SAMs) with the ability to auto-deploy flares. The real upgrade to the Su-25SM3 in the game, however, will be the venerable Kh-38ML and MT, which come in laser-guided and TV-guided modes respectively. The Kh-38MT is a true force to be reckoned with, being able to accurately target ground units from up to 40 Km (25 miles) away. All in all, the Su-25SM3 is a very deadly ground attacker and a worthy addition to the Frogfoot family, with the required potency and weapons to make short work from any enemy ground units from outside the SPAA range.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This may seem like a step down from the [[Su-25T]] or [[Su-39]] at first, given that you lose the venerable [[9K127 Vikhr]] air-to-ground missile pods, but between the SOLT-25 thermal tracking system and the Kh-38MT missiles, it's at worst a lateral move. The Kh-38MT missiles allow you to snipe ground targets from well over 20 km away, while the SOLT-25 allows for active tracking of targets, which makes taking out moving targets infinitely easier. It can also be used in a pinch to try to shoot down planes, but don't hold your breath there. While it loses a hardpoint compared to many other Su-25 variants, it helps to keep your loadout light anyway. Rolling with nothing but Kh-38s and R-73s is very viable in both RB and SB, as their incredible range turns you into a tank sniper and allows you to return to base for reloads extremely quickly.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Missile Approach Warning (MAW) System does a decent job throwing off many missile types
* SOLT-25 thermal tracking sight has the highest zoom of any Su-25, and actively tracks most targets
* The [[Kh-38MT|Kh-38]] is an incredible air-to-ground missile.
* Durable airframe
* Accelerates and climbs well

'''Cons:'''

* Loses a hardpoint, and forces you to choose between an air-to-ground weapon or a missile
* No [[9K127 Vikhr]] missiles
* Slow, poor manoeuvres at low speeds
