== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

The Su-25T is a dedicated anti-tank variant of the legendary Su-25 "Grach". The airframe was adapted from a two-seat trainer variant and the appearance is more hump-backed than the original model. The nose houses the same "Shkval" targeting system as the [[Ka-50]] attack helicopter and can be further assisted with a Mercury targeting pod carried on the belly pylon. The Su-25T's signature weapon is the infamous 9K127 Vikhr beam-riding ATGM with large capacity, long range, and secondary anti-air capabilities, but it still has a classic arsenal of destructive unguided and laser-guided munitions, along with some TV-guided options. This Frogfoot can rain endless destruction on enemy vehicles in uncontested skies, but at such a high battle rating its subsonic flight performance is extremely lacking and it is not a significant threat in air combat. Su-25T pilots must be vigilant of enemy SAM and fighter capabilities and use its bag of tricks to stay alive.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Su-25T weighs about 500 kg more than the basic Su-25 when empty due to the new electronics, but it has uprated R-195 turbojet engines than produce about 5% more thrust at full military power and have a new emergency mode that adds another 5% at the cost of rapid overheating. The overall flight performance is about the same: decent acceleration and handling for a subsonic jet but difficult to handle when weighed down with ordnance. The main issue is that the Su-25T's opposition consists of late 3rd generation and early 4th generation fighters that outperform it to an even greater margin than the basic Su-25. The only advantage it can boast of is a small turning radius because of its low speed, but the same could be said for a biplane and competent enemy pilots will know to use their enormous speed and climb advantages to prevent the Frogfoot from getting good opportunities to attack.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The Su-25T's armour layout is slightly different from the Su-25. The pilot still sits in a titanium "bathtub" and is surrounded by thick layers of bulletproof glass. There are now sheets of titanium on the sides of the nose, presumably for protecting the avionics but do not contribute much in War Thunder. The steel firewall between the engines and fuel tanks has been expanded and there is a new steel plate right behind the tail boom.

The Su-25T is the first jet in War Thunder to feature an IRCM system, which were previously only seen on helicopters. The IRCM is mounted in a pod at the base of the vertical stabilizer, and when active, will make it more difficult for IR missiles to lock onto the Frogfoot from the rear aspect.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|GSh-30-2 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 30 mm GSh-30-2 cannon, belly-mounted (200 rpg)
* 192 x countermeasures

The Su-25T features the same GSh-30-2 twin-barreled autocannon as the original Su-25. However, the cannon mount is slightly different as the gun is placed underneath the cockpit in an external gondola instead of being integrated into the nose, a result of the space required by the new targeting systems. It loses 50 rounds of ammunition, so it is important to make every shot count.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

{{Navigation-End}}

The Su-25T's arsenal includes just about everything in the original Su-25's arsenal (minus the small-calibre, high-capacity S-5K HEAT rockets), so the unguided bombs and rockets can be used in exactly the same way. The new and returning guided options are worth discussing in more detail.

It is helpful to carry the Mercury targeting pod when using any laser-guided air-to-ground weapons. Although it is primarily designed for NVD capabilities (no thermal optics, unfortunately) and the nose-mounted Shkval already has built-in zoom and auto-tracker systems, the Mercury system has a wider field of view from its belly placement and can look almost directly below the center of the Frogfoot, which makes it easier to keep the target locked when breaking away from a joust or incoming fire.

As could be expected of having the same targeting system as the Ka-50, the Su-25T can carry the 9K127 Vikhr ATGM in an unusual case of a fixed-wing aircraft being able to carry helicopter weapons. The Vikhr can be carried in greater numbers compared to helicopters and the speed and altitude of this launch platform helps extend the effective range somewhat. 800 mm of tandem-warhead penetration and about 5 kg of TNT equivalent are enough to dispatch both armoured and light targets alike upon direct hits. The Vikhrs of course can swat aircraft and even destroy incoming missiles because of their proximity fuses, but this does not mean that they are true air-to-air weapons. Acquiring a fast moving target with the auto tracker can be difficult and they do not have enough manoeuvrability to follow evasive manoeuvres, so in air combat they are best used in head-ons (to force opponents to break off) or when trailing slow and unaware enemies.

The Vikhrs are some of the Su-25T's most interesting weapons because they can be carried in huge numbers (no other jet can carry 16 guided air-to-ground missiles), have secondary utility, and have a lethal HEAT warhead for situations where bad luck or inconsistent overpressure effects could occasionally cause a HE warhead to only cause minor damage. With plenty to spare, they can also be ripple-fired in close pairs to double-tap heavily armoured targets or cast a wider net to intercept incoming missiles. However they do have some drawbacks as well: the Vikhr has a very narrow FOV for launch authorization and it lacks the raw HE power to destroy clustered targets or on near-misses.

New options are also available in the form of TV-guided weapons, as seen on the [[MiG-27M]]. The heavy Kh-29T AGM can be loaded on the inboard hardpoints. It has an enormous ~150 kg HE warhead and is fire-and-forget, so the Su-25T is completely free to break off after launch. This complements the Vikhrs well. Alternatively the same hardpoints can be used to mount the KAB-500Kr TV-guided bomb, but since they only have slightly more TNT equivalent than the Kh-29T and are unpowered (a major downside when being carried by a subsonic jet), they don't have as much utility.

The returning laser-guided Kh-25/ML and Kh-29L are far more viable than on the original Su-25 because of the advanced targeting systems. Although the [[MiG-27K]] is far better at using them for high-altitude "orbital strikes" because of its superior flight performance, they are fine for low-level attacks too. Amusingly, they can be used in a pinch for air combat: while lacking a proximity fuse, the semi-active laser guidance allows them to lead their targets while the Vikhr's beam riding cannot.

It may be tempting to load all of the Su-25T's hardpoints with ordnance, but because this Frogfoot really does not have any flight performance to spare, it is often more efficient to carry a lighter and less complicated loadout. A combination of Vikhrs and Kh-29Ts is enough to take down most types of ground targets while not requiring excessive micromanagement of the weapon systems. Unguided rockets are a good choice for additional firepower because they are convenient for close-in strafing attacks and can be disposed of quickly to lighten the aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Su-25T Frogfoot is best suited for ground attack in general, using similar low and fast passes, with the new guided munitions coming into play, especially the Vikhr missiles that have the potential to wipe ground units. It's also very survivable thanks to its sturdy airframe. In air battles, you are at a major disadvantage as aircraft you'll usually face have advanced radar missiles, along with pulse-Doppler radars. You will not outrun or catch any opponents. R-60M missiles are still decent, though they have to be conserved and used carefully. You can still dogfight enemies but the majority of vehicles, especially the F-14s, F-16s, and MiG-29s of top tier can still dance around you easily. At best, try to avoid confrontation, fly to the side and low, aiming for ground targets such as AAA, howitzers, and light pillboxes, or bombing bases if you can get there in time. IRCM will help, though it is best to use in tandem with countermeasures, as the IRCM is not guaranteed to spoof missiles, especially at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Cons:'''

* Slow aircraft and heavy aircraft, especially with ordnance
* IRCM cannot stop missiles that have IRCCM such as Stingers
* Can overspeed and overheat the engines if not careful with the throttle
* Mediocre manoeuvrability
* Controls compress at high speeds

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Su-25T project was an attempt to create an anti-tank aircraft that would be able to operate both during the daytime and at night, equipped with targeting systems and guided munitions to defeat armored vehicles. The list of equipment for the future aircraft was formalized in 1979, it was based on the Shkval targeting and navigation system and the Mercury television sight. The prototype passed the factory tests in 1987, by 1990 the project was prepared for mass production but due to the collapse of the USSR it did not start. A small batch of completed aircraft took part in the Chechen War in 1996. After the transfer of the production base from Tbilisi, Georgia to Ulan-Ude, Russia, the project was re-focused for export. An export version with slightly different avionics was designated the Su-39. In total, three attack aircraft of this configuration were built. Due to lack of funding, the project was closed.
