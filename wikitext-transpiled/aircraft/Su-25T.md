== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The SU-25T Frogfoot is best suited for ground attack in general, using similar low and fast passes, with the new guided munitions coming into play, especially the Vikhr missiles that have the potential to wipe ground units. It's also very survivable thanks to its sturdy airframe. In air battles, you are at a major disadvantage as aircraft you'll usually face have radar missiles that are advance, along with pulse Doppler radar. You will not outrun or catch any opponents. R-60M missiles are still decent, though they have to be conserved and used carefully. You can still dogfight enemies but the majority of vehicles, especially the F-14s, F-16s and MiG-29s of top tier can still dance around you easily. At best, try to avoid confrontation, fly to the side and low, aiming for ground targets such as AAA, howitzers and light pillboxes or bombing bases if you can get there in time. IRCM will help, though it is best to use in tandem with countermeasures, as the IRCM is not guaranteed to spoof missiles, especially at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===	
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''	
* Slightly upgraded flight performance, with a newer engine
* Engines can be overclocked too 104 percent throttle for extra thrust
* Can equip Kh-29Ts and 9K127 Vihkr missiles for ground attack
* IRCM jammer that can disrupt air-to-air missiles, along with a good amount of countermeasures
* Sturdy airframe, can survive missile hits from Stingers
* Upgraded RWR, can pinpoint radar pings accurately
* Large weaponry option, with different and unique combinations

'''Cons:'''

* Slow aircraft and heavy aircraft, especially with ordnance
* IRCM cannot stop missiles that have IRCCM such as Stingers
* Only two R-60Ms for self-defence
* Can overspeed and overheat the engines if not careful with the throttle
* Mediocre manoeuvrability
* Controls compress at high speeds

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Su-25T project was an attempt to create an anti-tank aircraft that would be able to operate both during the daytime and at night, equipped with targeting systems and guided munitions to defeat armored vehicles. The list of equipment for the future aircraft was formalized in 1979, it was based on the Shkval targeting and navigation system and the Mercury television sight. The prototype passed the factory tests in 1987, by 1990 the project was prepared for mass production but due to the collapse of the USSR it did not start. A small batch of completed aircraft took part in the Chechen War in 1996. After the transfer of the production base from Tbilisi, Georgia to Ulan-Ude, Russia, the project was re-focused for export. An export version with slightly different avionics was designated the Su-39. In total, three attack aircraft of this configuration were built. Due to lack of funding, the project was closed.
