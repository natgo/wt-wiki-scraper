== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

After the dissolution of the USSR, the Russian Federation cancelled many future aircraft projects meant to replace the existing inventory, such as the Su-37 and MiG-1.44. Due to the tight budget of the post-Soviet era, it was instead decided to upgrade existing aircraft with modern avionics and weaponry. The first of such upgrades was the '''Su-27SM''' (NATO reporting name: '''Flanker-B'''). The Su-27SM upgrade focused primarily on avionics, fire control, and flight control systems, with the primary upgrades being a new cockpit overhaul featuring HOTAS controls, multiple new multi-function displays replacing the old analog instruments, an entirely new navigation system using GLONASS (the Russian equivalent to GPS), a new fire-control system with an improved radar and electro-optical sighting system (IRST) allowing compatibility with new missiles such as the R-77 and slaving of weaponry such as the Kh-29 to the air-to-ground modes in the radar, and a far more advanced mission computer. Finally, the defensive suite was also overhauled, with the SPO-15 ''Beryoza'' being replaced by the modern ''Pastel'' radar warning receiver, and the famous ''Sorbtsiya'' wingtip jamming pods were also replaced by the more modern ''Khibiny'' system. The first Su-27SMs began trials in the late '90s and started entering service shortly after the turn of the century. The Su-27SM standard would receive various upgrades throughout its life, culminating in the modern day Su-27SM3 variant.

Introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]], the Su-27SM will be very familiar and is in most aspects similar to the previous [[Su-27]] in the tech tree. The primary differences are its armament, as the Su-27SM has access to the new R-77 Active Radar Homing missile to increase its lethality in air combat. More importantly, the Su-27SM offers guided ordnance options over its predecessor, in the forms of the KAB-500 TV guided bombs, the Kh-29TD medium range TV guided missiles, and the unique KAB-1500Kr, one of the largest TV guided weapons in-game. The Su-27SM unfortunately does not fix the main shortcomings of its predecessor against its contemporaries, such as the insufficiently low amount of countermeasures, the sub-par radar system, or the unstable flight dynamics. All in all, the Su-27SM serves as a step up from its predecessor, and in the right hands, can prove to be a dangerous aircraft in both air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very effective dorsal airbrake
* Has access to the large KAB-1500Kr guided bomb
* Can carry four Kh-29TD missiles

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely low energy retention, effective turn rate between 400-850 km/h below ≈3,500 m
* R-77s can only datalink two targets, hard to keep up with its contemporaries at its BR

The modernization program for the aging Su-27s in the Russian Air Force fleet was developed at KnAAPO at the end of 2002. This program aimed to qualitatively improve the combat qualities of the aircraft, improve flight performance and expand its capabilities. The Su-27 received a new RWR, an updated weapons control system and an updated radar for operating R-77 missiles, air-to-surface missiles and KAB-500Kr and KAB-1500Kr guided bombs. The first serially modernized Su-27SM were put into service in 2003, where it's currently in service with the Russian Air Force.
