<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
A remarkable iteration of the Su-25 family, the Su-25TM (designated the '''Su-39''' for export purposes) emerged as a product of Sukhoi's relentless pursuit of excellence in ground-attack aircraft design. Debuting in the late 1990s, this formidable aircraft marked a significant advancement over its predecessor, the [[Su-25]]. Its evolution was spurred by the lessons learned from conflicts such as the Soviet-Afghan War and the First Chechen War, where the Su-25 played a crucial role. The Su-39's capabilities were a testament to its modernization. Its arsenal featured an impressive array of weaponry, including precision-guided missiles like the Kh-29, Kh-25, and Vikhr, which enabled surgical strikes against both ground and naval targets. The integration of advanced avionics and targeting systems significantly enhanced its accuracy and situational awareness, allowing pilots to operate effectively in complex and dynamic environments.

The Su-39 was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]]. It stands as an epitome of ground strike prowess, a formidable aircraft purpose-built to excel in the art of precision attacks on terrestrial and naval targets. At its core lies a potent arsenal, highlighted by an array of guided air-to-ground missiles that define its battlefield dominance. Among these are the Kh-29, Kh-25, and Vikhr missiles, each embodying a unique blend of strategic versatility. The Kh-29, renowned for its extended range and pinpoint accuracy, enables the Su-39 to engage high-priority targets with surgical precision, making it a formidable choice for engaging fortified positions or high value targets. The Kh-25, on the other hand, offers rapid response capabilities, swiftly neutralizing time-sensitive threats with its agility and flexibility. Complementing these is the Vikhr missile, engineered to excel in anti-armour engagements, effectively dismantling armoured formations and bolstering ground forces. These air-to-ground missiles, seamlessly integrated into the Su-39's operational framework, transform it into a vanguard of modern warfare, bridging the gap between intelligence and action with lethal finesse.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Su-39's flight performance is nothing remarkable, particularly when it comes to combat scenarios where agility and responsiveness are paramount. Its design, characterized by sleek swept wings, ensures exceptional manoeuvrability, enabling precise and rapid in-flight adjustments. This agility is especially evident in its high-G manoeuvres, allowing the aircraft to execute evasive actions and engage targets with unparalleled precision even in dynamic and challenging environments. In combat, the Su-39's twin-engine configuration provides robust thrust, resulting in impressive acceleration and climb rates. This power-to-weight advantage not only facilitates swift engagement but also enables rapid altitude changes, a critical asset in maintaining the element of surprise and evading hostile threats. While the Su-39 excels in various aspects of ground attack and combat manoeuvrability, it's worth noting that it operates within a subsonic flight regime, resulting in a comparatively lower maximum speed. This subsonic characteristic, while not detracting from its overall combat effectiveness and versatility, does place certain limitations on its ability to rapidly cover vast distances.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Su-39's formidable arsenal of precision-guided weapon systems is explicitly tailored to unleash devastating target destruction capabilities across a diverse spectrum of ground attack scenarios. Take, for instance, the Kh-29 missile, a long-range precision instrument capable of obliterating entrenched enemies or flagships with surgical accuracy at an impressive range of 13 kilometres. Its potency is further magnified in engaging time-sensitive targets such as escort warships or mobile air defense systems, where the Kh-25 missile's rapid response capabilities ensure swift and effective destruction. In addition, the use of Mercury and Kopyo pods enhance the power projection capabilities and combat abilities of the aircraft. One of the primary capabilities of the Kopyo-25 radar pod is its ability to provide radar imaging and multi-target tracking via TWS mode. This allows the Su-39 to detect and track ground and air targets, even in adverse weather conditions or challenging terrain. The radar pod's imaging and tracking capabilities enable the aircraft to effectively identify and engage both stationary and moving targets, which are slaved to the FLIR, enhancing the pilot's situational awareness. The Kopyo-25 radar pod also plays a crucial role in target designation and guidance for precision-guided munitions. By accurately locating and designating targets, the radar pod enables the Su-39 to deliver highly accurate and effective strikes against a variety of targets effortlessly, including armoured vehicles, fortifications, and other high-value objectives. This enhances the aircraft's versatility and effectiveness in both offensive and defensive roles.

In the theatre of anti-armour warfare, the Vikhr missile system reigns supreme. Designed with precision engagement in mind, it strikes with unerring accuracy, systematically dismantling armoured formations and neutralizing the enemy's armoured might. Complementing these guided ordnance options is the Su-39's 30 mm GSh-30-2 cannon, a ground-pounding force that decimates ground targets ranging from enemy combat vehicles to fortified emplacements, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Expanding the Su-39's repertoire of devastation are additional munitions with their own specialized roles. Incendiary bombs, capable of igniting ferocious fires, can swiftly consume enemy bases or obstruct routes, adding a layer of tactical impact. Dumb rockets and bombs, with their widespread impact and formidable blast radius, excel in saturating large areas with destruction, obliterating enemy forces and fortifications in a single concerted sweep. Moreover, the Su-39's arsenal extends to high-drag bombs, designed to create concentrated impact points upon release. This capability proves invaluable in hitting entrenched or fortified targets with concentrated force, ensuring maximum structural damage. These high-drag bombs enable the Su-39 to deliver precise and punishing strikes against even the most resilient enemy positions with minimum exposure.
