== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Su-6 was a project by Sukhoi with the objective of creating an attack aircraft capable of surpassing the Il-2. The '''Su-6 AM-42''' was the name given to its last version. Compared to previous prototypes, it featured the same rear gunner as the third prototype, [[Su-6 (M-71F)]], but now with a liquid-cooled inline engine instead of a radial engine, the Mikulin AM-42. While this engine was less powerful than the M-71F, it proved to be more reliable. The Su-6 AM-42 was tested against the Il-10 in 1944, but the tests favoured the design from Ilyushin and the Su-6 never went into serial production.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]]. The Su-6 is a ground attack aircraft made with a bit of the IL-2 mindset, but with some improvements regarding manoeuvrability and speed, while lacking protection. Despite the improvements, it is still not recommended to go for enemy planes as, unless it is a head-on, you will lose energy quickly and perish. The gunner can help deal with some opponents that stick to your tail, but with only 24° of horizontal guidance, it won't be able to help in most cases. The armour is good at the back, but it won't stop much more than a 12.7 mm bullet. Everything is compensated by the wide array of payload options, even allowing you to change the [[NS-37 (37 mm)|37 mm NS-37 cannons]] for weaker but higher capacity and easier to aim [[VYa-23 (23 mm)|23 mm VYa-23 cannons]], which can still take out pillboxes and light tanks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Su-6, like the previous Ilyushin attackers, is a tough aircraft that excels at taking out enemy ground targets. The Su-6 comes equipped with two 37 mm cannons as standard armament, which can be swapped out for 23 mm cannons. With the 37 mm cannons, the aircraft can take out most ground targets with ease: even heavy tanks don't stand a chance with well-aimed shots to the sides or rear.  As they rapidly lose accuracy in full-auto fire, controlled semi-auto fire is required to make the most out of the 37 mm cannons. It may be easier to take out most ground targets with the 23 mm cannons (given they're far more accurate than the 37 mm cannons in full-auto). With either choice of cannon armament, the Su-6 can even be a lethal foe for enemy attackers who aren't too careful, though the 23 mm cannons are better suited to anti-air attacks compared to the 37 mm. Apart from the higher BR and different cannon options compared to previous Soviet attackers, the Su-6 plays much like the Il-2s that precede it.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Well armoured
* Powerful, multi-purpose cannons to attack ground and air targets
* Good short term manoeuvrability at moderate speeds

'''Cons:'''

* Rear gunner has restrictive firing angles
* Defensive armament doesn't keep up with the offensive armament of opposing aircraft
* Bad sustained turn rate
* Bad climb-rate compared to fighters
* Uncontrollable at high speeds and bad redline speeds
* Engine overheats easily

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
