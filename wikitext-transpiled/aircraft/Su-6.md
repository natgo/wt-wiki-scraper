== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The development of the '''Su-6''' began in 1939 when the Sukhoi design bureau started working on a single-seat ground attack aircraft. The performance of the Su-6 was overall superior to the Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft, unfortunately the radial engine powering the Su-6 exceeded its age limit before the testing was completed and thus no more engines were available for the aircraft to enter mass production. Thanks to combat experience with the Il-2s, later prototypes were designed with a rear gunner using 12.7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun protecting the rear hemisphere of the aircraft. This meant a decreased bomb load and to counter this, a more powerful engine was installed, the Shvetsov M-71F radial engine. Overall, the Su-6 was faster than the Il-2, however at the expense of carrying a smaller bomb load, the Su-6 never reached production, thanks to its late development and the introduction of the Il-10.

It was introduced in [[Update "Raining Fire"]]. This Su-6 in particular is the first prototype, the one without a rear gunner and the less powerful M-71 engine. However the Su-6 is still very competitive and capable for its BR. It features a decent flight performance for an attack aircraft, with a mediocre top speed and acceleration but a good turn radius, although the mediocre engine translates to a low rate of climb. It has a very capable armament though, the twin 23 mm cannons are more than enough to destroy unarmoured ground targets and most aircraft in a few bursts with the right ammo. While the ground ordnance is somewhat decent, since neither the bombs or the rockets are particularly large, they should be used with precision.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

If you have flown the [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]], the Su-6 is a very familiar experience, as it shares many of the IL-2's performance characteristics. The greatest improvement of the Su-6 compared to the IL-2 is a much-improved top speed of 491 km/h, almost 100 km/h faster than the ultimate IL-2 variants. Other than that, the aircraft has very similar characteristics to the IL-2: competitive instantaneous turn rate, subpar energy retention in sustained turns (particularly at higher speeds), moderately responsive control surfaces and a decent turn rate.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

Compared to the [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]] and [[IL-10]], the Su-6 is much less survivable mainly due to a reduction in armour plating. The aircraft's armour is concentrated around the cockpit, with 12 mm of plating in the lower front and back, 6 mm of plating on the sides, and 65 mm of bulletproof glass in front of the cockpit. Unlike the IL-2 and IL-10, the Su-6's engine block is unarmoured, meaning that head-ons in this aircraft are extremely dangerous due to the risk of engine damage.

The Su-6's main fuel tank is located directly underneath the cockpit and is also covered by the cockpit armour; this fuel tank is also self-sealing and features a neutral gas fire suppression system. The oil cooling system is mounted between the engine and cockpit, but is unarmoured making it more susceptible to damage.

* 6 mm steel behind propeller spinner
* 6 mm steel under oil cooling systems
* 6 mm steel on both sides of fuel tank
* 6 mm steel on both sides of pilot
* 8 mm steel above pilot's head
* 12 mm steel in front of and behind fuel tank
* 12 mm steel behind pilot
* 65 mm bulletproof glass in front of pilot
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 underneath pilot)

The development of the Su-6 began in 1939 when the Sukhoi design bureau started working on a single-seat ground attack aircraft. Two prototypes were ordered on 4th March 1940, with the first of them having its maiden flight on 1st March 1941 with test pilot A.I. Kokin. The performance of the Su-6 was overall superior to the Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft, unfortunately the Shvetsov M-71 radial engine powering the Su-6 exceeded its age limit before the testing was completed and there were no further M-71 engines available as the engines were never mass produced and only a few were made. The second Su-6 prototype flew only in January 1942 as the Sukhoi design bureau had to be evacuated after the German attack of the Soviet Union. A draft proposing production of 25 aircraft was prepared, but it was never issued.

Combat experiences during the war with single seat Il-2s called for the need of a rear gunner, so the third prototype of the Su-6 was designed with a second crew member utilizing a 12.7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun protecting the rear hemisphere of the aircraft. Due to the addition of the crew member and machine gun with its ammunition, the bomb load decreased from 400 to 200 kg of bombs and the prototype was fitted with a more powerful Shvetsov M-71F engine. The modified Su-6 was 100 km/h faster than the Il-2 at the expense of having a smaller payload. When development of the M-71 engine was cancelled, Sukhoi was ordered to utilize the liquid-cooled Mikulin AM-42 engine. With flight tests beginning on 22nd February 1944, the re-engined Su-6 proved inferior to the Ilyushin Il-10 as it had an additional 250 kg of armour protecting the newly installed engine and lower output compared to the previously used M-71F. The Su-6 never entered production and only 3 prototypes were made. In 1943, Pavel Sukhoi was awarded the Stalin Prize of the 1st Degree for the development of the aircraft.
