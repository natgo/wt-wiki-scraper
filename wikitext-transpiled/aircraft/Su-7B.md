== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Su-7B is characterised by a low BR for a supersonic jet and amazing acceleration. With a 1-1 thrust-weight ratio when at optimal fuel load and spaded, it can reliably punch above its weight. The Sukhoi accelerates extremely well, outspeeding every supersonic at its BR except for MiG-21s. The manoeuvrability isn't bad, either - It can easily turn with supersonic aircraft such as MiG-21s, Harriers or A-7s. However, you must keep in mind that the plane has a tendency to break its wings if in a sustained 9+G turn at high speeds, and that you are not invulnerable while turning. You are giant, almost twice as big as a MiG-21, so be sure to not overstay your welcome in a dogfight and zoom away as soon as possible.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|NR-30 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 30 mm NR-30 cannons, wing-mounted (80 rpg = 160 total)

The Su-7B comes equipped with 2 x 30 mm NR-30 cannons; these will be familiar to pilots which flew the succeeding [[Su-7BKL]], or the [[MiG-19PT]] and [[MiG-21F-13]] in the parallel line. The [[Su-7 (Family)|Su-7]] has greater ammunition capacity than earlier MiGs with the gun, 160 rounds giving a trigger time of approximately 4.8 seconds. With velocity ranging from 780-785 m/s depending on the shell, this is much faster than the earlier [[NR-23 (23 mm)|NR-23]] or [[N-37D (37 mm)|N-37D]] found on earlier Soviet jets. This greatly simplifies aiming, and with the 67.14 g of TNTe filler found in the {{Annotation|HEF-I|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary}} and {{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}} shells, hits from this cannon will usually cripple or destroy enemy aircraft on the first hit. As the Su-7BKL is a strike fighter the guns may also be used against armoured targets; the mix of {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}} with 48 mm penetration and {{Annotation|APHE|Armour-piercing high-explosive}} with 37 mm penetration, but 22.48 g TNTe of explosive filler will do significant damage to enemy armour. It is recommended to attack from above, as most enemy tanks have weak roof armour and can be more effectively penetrated from above.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|OFAB-250sv (250 kg)|FAB-500M-54 (500 kg)|ZB-360 incendiary}}
{{main|S-3K|S-5K|S-24}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 64 x S-5K rockets
- 4 x S-24 rockets
- 28 x S-3K rockets
- 4 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (1,000 kg total)
- 4 x 500 kg FAB-500M-54 bombs (2,000 kg total)
- 4 x ZB-360 incendiary bombs

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Su-7B has a very good acceleration and can outspeed most jets, it can easily doge incoming missiles by turning as it can turn and still maintain most of its speed (mind the G forces as it can easily break your plane apart and make the pilot lose conscience). The Su-7B sports 30 mm NR-30 cannons and can also be equipped with both bombs and rockets for various types of playstyle. The Su-7B also comes with a rangefinding radar and the S-24 can be put on a distance fuse to be used in air combat.

'''Air combat'''

At the start of a match, take 27 minutes of fuel and equip Air targets belt. Start ascending on a 20-30° angle to an altitude of 7-9 km, your goal is to get behind the enemies in order to easily take care of them without their knowledge of your presence. Keep flying at this altitude and overfly enemy fighters. If there is an enemy at this altitude, feel free to engage into a head-on or dodge them. Keep flying above the enemies until there are none underneath you, turn around and start descending while keeping an eye on your speed. Go for the nearest enemy or slowest (A-10s for example). Get behind them and approach as fast as possible as speed is your greatest advantage. Start firing when you're close enough. If the enemy is eliminated, go for the next one, but if you missed do not engage into a dogfight: maintain your speed and go after the next target. If there are any AI planes, you can safely go after them and make use of your gyro linked gunsight to auto adjust your guns' distance. Align your plane behind the AI plane, put your gunsight's dot on the plane, and shoot a short burst of rounds (it is more precise in the first person view). After having expended your ammunition, you can return back to the base to continue fighting or swap tactics.

'''Attacking ground targets'''

At the start of a match, equip the 28 x S-3K rockets or the 64 x S-5K rockets (which will be helpful to take care of light and medium tanks). Start ascending on a 5° angle until above 1 km altitude, you will need the speed to quickly evade enemies and enemy missiles. It's best to flank and fly to the far sides of the map, so you can easily fly in a straight line and take care of ground targets one after the other. When firing at a ground target: any tank except for medium and heavy tanks requires a single hit by both rockets, while medium and heavy tanks would require 2 or more rockets. Always keep a eye on your surroundings as you're flying fast at a low altitude, which can catch the attention of enemy jets who will then try to engage you. Maintaining a high speed is important, in case a missile is fired at you. After depleting all of your rockets, you can head back to base to resupply rockets or start going after enemy players or AI planes.

'''Bombing bases'''

At the start of a match, equip the 4 x ZB-360 bombs (as that is enough to take care of a base). And start ascending on a 10° angle to 1-2 km, you might be behind everyone a little bit but the higher top speed and acceleration you will get on this altitude will make up for it. Start heading for any enemy base and keep this altitude. Avoid any head-on and beware of enemies below and above you with missiles that might eliminate you. When you're near the base, start diving, enable your airbrakes, and get into position to drop your payload. Once bombs have been dropped, you can head back to base for another bombing run or start going after enemy players, AI planes or ground targets. The choice is yours.

'''CAS ground'''

When flying the Su-7B, equip the 4 x S-24 rockets (as a single hit from these is enough to take care of any ground target). Start heading to the battle area and keep a high altitude to avoid SPAAs and enemy planes. Once close enough, start diving and search for targets to fire at. If there is a SPAA that starts shooting at you, prioritize it above everything else. If there are no SPAAs, fire a single rocket at a target and go after the next one (even if it misses the target, the rocket will overpressurize them). Once too low, start pulling up and gain altitude again, then repeat this process until you're out of rockets. You can then go to base to resupply or go after enemy planes, soft ground targets or helicopters.

'''Enemies worth noting'''

[[A-10A]] / [[A-10A Late]]: these American strike aircraft might seem slow but they have access to the mid-range and fast [[AIM-9L Sidewinder]] air-to-air missiles which are very accurate. It's almost impossible to dodge them even when flying above Mach 1.1. It's best to keep a distance from the A-10s, as the missiles have an all-aspect tracking and dodging them in a head-on is close to impossible. The best way to defeat the A-10 is from behind, as even from the sides the A-10 can quickly turn around and fire a missile. When coming at it from behind, approach as fast as possible as the A-10 is slow. Speed is your advantage to quickly win the fight if it doesn't respond fast enough. If you miss the attack, quickly turn back around and hope that the A-10 won't fire its missile at you. After a missed interception it's best to leave the A-10 and go after other targets as now the A-10 is aware of your presence, and going for a second interception would be taking an unnecessary risk.

=== Radars ===

<!--{{main|SRD-5}}-->

The Su-7B is equipped with a SRD-5 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

On May 14th 1953, shortly after Stalin's death and the reopening of the Sukhoi OKB, they began work on a swept-wing front-line fighter. Their first prototype was named S-1 and was fitted with the all-new Lyulka AL-7 turbojet. It was the first Soviet aircraft to utilize the all-moving tailplane and a translating centerbody, plus a dramatic wing sweep of 60°, irreversible hydraulically boosted controls, and an ejection seat of Sukhoi's own design. After the success of the S-1, production began with the S-2. later renamed the '''Su-7'''.

Later, on 31 July 1958, the Soviet Tactical Aviation tasked Sukhoi with developing a ground-attack variant of the Su-7, which could replace the scrapped Ilyushin [[IL-10 (Family)|IL-10]]. The resulting prototype, S-22, incorporated structural refinements for high-speed, low-altitude operations. It first flew in March 1959 and entered service in 1961 as the '''Su-7B'''.

=== [[wt:en/news/6738-development-su-7b-new-doctrine-en|Devblog]] ===
With the development of jet aviation, piston-engined attack aircraft quickly became an anachronism; a need arose for a new class of front-line aircraft - a fighter bomber. In the USSR, the MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighter jets were used to replace the piston-engined IL-10 to support the ground forces from the air, but it was quite obvious that a specialized machine was needed to fulfill the tasks of the fighter-bomber. The most suitable candidate was the Sukhoi Su-7 fighter jet, taken as the basis for the Su-7B fighter-bomber project. By the end of 1958, the first prototype was ready with the new AL-7F-1 engine. For almost two years, the aircraft underwent intensive testing and refinement, and in 1960 the new fighter-bomber went into mass production. Of the 431 planned, 344 Su-7Bs were built to equip up to 25 combat units. From the beginning of the 1970s, the Su-7B aircraft began to be replaced with more modern modifications and models.
