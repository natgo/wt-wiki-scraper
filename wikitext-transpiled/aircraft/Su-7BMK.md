== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Red Skies"]].

It bears Egyptian air force insignia and roundels.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The pilot is well protected from shots, with a 102 mm bulletproof glass front windscreen in the cockpit, an 8 mm steel plate in front of the instrument panel, and a 5 mm steel plate above the windshield. There is also some armour protection from behind: 36 mm Aluminium Alloy plates for the seat and a 20 mm Aluminium Alloy plate for the headrest. There is no protection from shots coming from the sides.

{{main|NR-30 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 2 x 30 mm NR-30 cannons, wing-mounted (80 rpg = 160 total)

=== Suspended armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|S-3K|S-5K|S-24}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 96 x S-5K rockets
- 42 x S-3K rockets
- 6 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (1,500 kg total)
- 4 x 500 kg FAB-500M-54 bombs (2,000 kg total)
- 4 x 500 kg FAB-500M-54 bombs + 2 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (2,500 kg total)

- 6 x S-24 rockets

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Arcade battles

The Su-7BMK can bomb bases, intercept bombers, and fight other fighter planes at the same time. With the excellent acceleration of the Su-7, you can easily catch up with the enemy because of the massive and powerful engine with its afterburner. However, keep an eye on the fuel: the afterburner burns a ton of fuel when active, so the best would be to fill the fuel tank up to full. The plane also features a ballistic computer and two 30 mm autocannons, with excellent ammo selection, which can rip apart any plane you'll face in battle. The Su-7BMK can perform well in a 1-vs-1 scenario, but if it encounters multiple enemy planes, it will have problems (especially if your enemy is equipped with air-to-air missiles). The best would be to have a teammate close to you, so you will have some cover if things go wrong.

;Realistic battles

Dogfighting is not viable because of the poor turn rate; the enemy can out-turn you quickly and get behind you. The Su-7BMK is an interceptor/attacker with a slow roll rate. Because of the low ammo capacity of the guns (160 rounds), pilots should apply strict trigger discipline. The two 30 mm autocannons are potent and can quickly destroy most planes that the Su-7BMK fights. Remember to use short/controlled bursts since the ammo belts are short. Overall, the Su-7BMK should remain an interceptor and a base bomber. With its ballistic computer, pilots will obliterate ground targets and bases.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- High flight speed and rate of climb
- Retains energy very well
- The 4 x 500 kg + 2 x 250 kg bombload allows for efficient bombing
- Its speed lets you quickly reach bomb targets and return to base for rearming before enemies can get to you
- Radar Warning Receiver (stock)

'''Cons:'''

- Decreased manoeuvrability at high speeds
- Lacks guided weapons: neither AGMs nor AAMs are available
- Wings can be ripped apart if one isn't careful when diving on bomb targets
- No countermeasures
- Is practically restricted to ground operations

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Su-7BMK was a simplified export variant of the Su-7BM. The fighters were produced from 1967 to 1971 to more than 400 units and exported to Egypt, India, Algeria, North Korea, and Afghanistan. The Su-7BMK is identical to the Su-7BKL except for its landing gear, IFF system, and ballistic computer.
