== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Winged Lions"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VI, "Firepower"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The flight performance of this plane is extremely sluggish, despite having a combined total of 4,000 horsepower, the plane still struggles to perform most manoeuvres. It has a poor turn radius, low lock-up speeds, and has a subpar climb rate compared to other aircraft at this BR. In mixed battles, the performance is made even worse with suspended ordnance options, which can up to 1,500 kg of additional weight. The plane does however have a silver lining, at low speeds, landing flaps can provide a very high amount of lift, which allows the plane to turn on a dime. The flaps can withstand speeds no more than 280 km/h (155 mph), but they can allow for the plane to make sharp turns to get into position to use the 45 mm cannons or establish a bomb line.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Su-8 has copious amounts of armour, similar to other Russian strike aircraft such as the IL-2. This means the Su-8 can withstand incredible amounts of punishment, especially from machine gun fire. Dual engines allow the plane to return home if one is taken out, and pilot armour protects the pilot in any head-on engagement. The Su-8 should take every head-on engagement possible for this reason. In addition to pilot armour, the rear gunner also has good protection from the front and back of the aircraft.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
This is a premium aircraft, which means all modifications will be unlocked when this plane is obtained.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|NS-45 (45 mm)|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 45 mm NS-45 cannons, belly-mounted (50 rpg = 200 total)
* 8 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, wing-mounted (600 rpg = 4,800 total)

The incredible NS-45 cannon seen on the [[Yak-9K]] is mounted on the Su-8. However instead of one cannon, the Su-8 wields four of these monstrous cannons. The armoured targets belt can penetrate the roof of every tank at the Su-8's BR, as well as the sides of many lightly-armoured vehicles. There is a price to pay for having such incredible armament. The recoil on these guns is extremely significant, it is recommended to fire in very short, controlled bursts. The recoil on this gun is effectively a stopping mechanism, as it can bleed so much speed when attacking a target, that you'll need to continuously adjust lead for every shot you fire. The gun velocity is pretty good, however it does not compare to the German MK 103 tank busting cannon, which has a much higher velocity. You'll need to calculate for gun drop when shooting at ground targets from a distance of more than a kilometre.

The smaller calibre ShKAS machine guns are also an important asset to this aircraft's success. They have an incredibly high rate of fire, and the Su-8 has eight of them. This is an incredible amount of bullets, and any soft AI target in Air Battles will be completely obliterated by a short burst. Once again, this incredible feature has a price to pay. The guns have a tendency to jam rather quickly, so short bursts are the key to success. The guns are also mounted very far away from the nose. Gun targeting needs to be set correctly in order for maximum effect, 500 m or so will be good for attacking ground units and spraying at pesky fighters.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* 8 x 7 mm machine guns with an high rate of fire
* 4 x 45 mm cannons absolutely annihilate aircraft on any hit, and have no trouble penetrating the roof of any tank at its BR
* Wide range of payload options, can carry up to 1,430 kg of bombs and rockets in total. 2 x 500 kg bombs are perfect for mixed battles
* Lots of pilot armour, engine armour, and gunner armour to protect from most weapons it faces
* Rear gunner has good coverage, allowing you to deter any fighter that gets close
* Gets an attacker airspawn. Coupled with a steady climb, it's a good choice for intercepting bombers
* Landing flaps can significantly increase turn time

'''Cons:'''

* Turn time is not on par with other aircraft at its BR. Feels sluggish and will lose energy fast
* Compression issues at high speeds. It's best not to dive in this plane
* Significant recoil when firing the NS-45, will cause a bleed in speed.
* Guns mounted in the wings, necessary to set a convergence, but not all shells will hit
* Guns jam incredibly fast, so short bursts are recommended
* Very large target that is easy to hit
* Gunner provides little protection against heavy fighters and other strike aircraft
* No bombsight for mixed battles, a bombing run requires a skilled pilot

=== [[wt:en/news/7526-development-battle-pass-vehicles-su-8-en|Devblog]] ===
The team at the Sukhoi Design Bureau submitted to the 1940 competition for for the Red Army Air Force a project of a single-seat twin-engine aircraft with the promising M-71 engines, which were supposed to provide good flight characteristics even when using a large payload weight. After the initial approval of the idea and the first recommendations received from military authorities, the production facilities of aviation plant No. 289 were hastily evacuated to the city of Molotov, since the German army was approaching Moscow. Despite the turmoil and confusion associated with the relocation of production facilities,work on the aircraft's design continued and went on until the end of the war.

While development was in progress, the aircraft became a two-seater, the engines received an afterburner mode, armor was significantly increased, and firepower increased drastically. The final factory tests on the Su-8 took place only in the spring of 1945, when the attack aviation niche was occupied by Ilyushin aircraft and the latest IL-10 was already in service, the components and assembly of which had been mastered in production. The Su-8 attack aircraft was not submitted for state testing and the project was closed in 1945.
