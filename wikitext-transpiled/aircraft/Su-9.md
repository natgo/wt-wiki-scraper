== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->	
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 6 mm steel above pilot's head
* 12 mm steel headrest
* 12 mm steel behind pilot
* 15 mm steel behind frontal fuel tank
* 15 mm steel in front of armament
* 90 mm bulletproof glass in front of pilot
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 cleaver-shaped one behind pilot, 1 cleaver-shaped one in front of pilot)

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|N-37 (37 mm)|NS-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 37 mm N-37 cannon, nose-mounted (40 rpg)
* 2 x 23 mm NS-23 cannons, nose-mounted (100 rpg = 200 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FAB-250M-46 (250 kg)|FAB-500M-46 (500 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 1 x 250 kg FAB-250M-46 bomb (250 kg total)
* 2 x 250 kg FAB-250M-46 bombs (500 kg total)
* 1 x 500 kg FAB-500M-46 bomb (500 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Air RB'''

This plane has great firepower but always watch the ammo count so you won't run out of bullets. The plane has 90 mm of bulletproof glass in front of the pilot, so your pilot has a high chance of survival in head-ons. Once the plane gets up to speed, it becomes a great bomber hunter. Keep in mind that this plane has a slow acceleration. Use HE belt or air targets belt as it will shred enemy aircraft in pieces with just a few well-aimed shots. [[Boom & Run]] tactics are recommended against fighters, but make sure you have some speed before attacking.  

'''Ground RB'''

The Su-9 is capable of destroying ground targets with its suspended armament. When dive bombing, don't pull of to late as the engines aren't that powerful. It is possible to destroy some light and medium tanks with the right ammunition belt. For destroying tanks, top-down approaches are heavily recommended.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful offensive armament
* Airbrakes

'''Cons:'''

* Bad acceleration and bad climb rate
* Low ammunition count
* Very sluggish with suspended armament
