== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Sunderland Mk V is rather finicky in the air. Handling is not all that bad, turn time is about 20-25 seconds spaded with flaps. However, the wings can only take 3-4Gs before they snap off. Due to the low rip speed, this means you can potentially rip your wings when flying a spaded aircraft at top speed.

If there is no water available to land in, it will be necessary to belly land on the airfields. If so, take care to not let the pontoons touch the ground. However, after descending all the way for the landing, it will be necessary to continue the fight at a low altitude due to the Sunderland's atrocious climb rate forbidding any chance of reaching back to optimal bombing altitude in a timely manner.

{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)|Browning (7.7 mm)|Vickers K (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

- 4 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, tail turret (1,000 rpg = 4,000 total)
- 1 x 7.7 mm Vickers K machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (600 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

After unloading your ordnance, it's best to return to base (or wait for reload in arcade battles) and get another load. In RB/SB, taking note from the "Flight Performance" section, land appropriately and continue the fight at a lower altitude to get back quickly for another bomb drop.

At this low altitude, and with some degree of luck, the Sunderland can be used as a "gunship" fighter. It's possible to gunship manoeuvre into a furball and shoot down a plane or two. Against other bombers, attempting the "gunship" method is possible, however you must be careful of defensive weapons on the enemy bomber. The best bet is to fly just below the enemy fighter or side by side, as there are no bombers at this battle rating which have this kind of armament and the Sunderland's survivability against rifle calibre is exceptional. The forward MGs can be used, but it isn't as effective as the other turrets. The side of the aircraft is where all the main firepower is located. Knowing this, keeping your enemy in the top and rear hemisphere is advisable for maximum guns on target while being shielded from most defensive weapons.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- It has many turrets, equal or more effective than even the higher rank Wellingtons, Stirlings and Lancasters
- Has 4 x offensive 7.7 mm machine guns
- Its fuselage can soak up a lot of damage, especially from low calibre machine guns
- Can land both on land (belly slide) and in the water (not on an aircraft carrier)
- Great turret coverage, especially from the front, side, top and back of the plane
- Has .50 calibre on the side which packs a punch and can obliterate enemy fighters if they hit
- Turns rather well for a four-engine bomber

'''Cons:'''

- Small bomb load
- Handles like a flying train (A.K.A. not very well)
- Due to the lack of a bomb bay, bombs are slid out from the hatches on the side of the aircraft which can make them hard to aim
- The .50 calibre only cover the side of the aircraft, making them difficult to use effectively
- No ventral turret coverage, a smart fighter will attack you from below
- No armour. The crew are vulnerable. A few good hits on the cockpit and you're going down
- Wooden fuselage means that you will catch fire easily
- Slow, even biplanes can catch you
- Does not dive well. Escaping from an enemy aircraft is difficult

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

[[File:Sunderland Screenshot 5.jpg|thumb|Cockpit of the Sunderland Mark V]]

The Short S.25 Sunderland is a British designed & built flying boat, designed primarily to fulfill the role of a patrol bomber, the Sunderland was used primarily by the RAF, but also saw use with the French Navy, RAAF & SAAF just to name a few. The Mark V version of the Sunderland was initially developed due to concerns that the aircraft was underpowered, due to this the Bristol Pegasus engines used on previous models were replaced by Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp (S3C4-G) engines, these new engines offered a considerable power increase while also not causing any reductions in range or flight time, a particular benefit of the new power plant was that the Mark V could remain airborne after 2 of its 4 engines failed, this greatly improved the aircraft's survivability in comparison to earlier versions. A total of 155 Mark V airframes were produced with an additional 33 earlier Mark III's converted to Mark V standard with the updated engines.

The Mark V also featured a new centimetric ASV Mark VI C radar, this is an updated version of the air to surface radar that was also featured on later production Mark III airframes and is especially noticeable by the antenna on the underside of the wings just outboard of the floats. This radars was primarily used in the aircraft's coastal command role for detecting enemy ships.
