== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]]. It is a competitive aircraft with good air to air and air to ground capability.

The Super Étendard, a French naval fighter aircraft, boasts a storied legacy in aviation history due to its impressive capabilities and distinguished service record. Its inception in the 1970s marked the beginning of an era where this sleek and agile aircraft played a pivotal role within the French Navy and numerous other countries across the globe. Recognized for its adaptability and exceptional combat performance, the Super Étendard has remained an iconic representation of precision strike capabilities and carrier-based operations, etching an enduring legacy within the realm of military aviation.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Super Étendard is quite a manoeuvrable plane. It features good manoeuvring energy retention even at high speeds, it does not compress easily, and due to its new engine compared to the original Étendard IVM, it has a much higher thrust-to-weight ratio, allowing it to climb extremely well, and making it able to reach supersonic speeds, even though it does not have an afterburner. Overall a fun plane to fly, although it may feel quite unstable during certain manoeuvres.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Super Étendard relies heavily on the pilots positioning and defensive flying capability to survive. Its high thrust to weight ratio, good manoeuvring energy retention and the fact that it doesn't compress easily makes it quite an easy plane to fly defensively, as it can take advantage of enemies weaknesses. However due to its flight model, it does not like to lose energy or rather speed, which means that making an enemy overshoot is quite harder to achieve than with a delta wing.

It also features a total of 180 countermeasures. It is easy to flare off incoming missiles due to its lack of an afterburner, and high amount of countermeasures.

The Super Étendard features really good armament for engaging air targets as well as ground targets. It can take 180 countermeasures, 2 x R550 Magic 1 missiles, as well as 4 x guided bombs at the same time, making it extremely competitive in ground battles, as well as in air battles when used as a multirole aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Super Étendard feels like a true modern multirole fighter, but at a lower BR.

In ARB matches, it should be used with mixed or reinforced flares, and 2 x R550 Magic 1 missiles, along with 10 minutes of fuel (20 min if you are not aggressive, or if you play on a big map). This makes you the most efficient at keeping your own plane alive, while being able to get some quite easy kills. The Super Étendard is a reliable Boom and Zoom plane, but can hold its own quite well in Energy Fighting due to its high thrust-to-weight ratio.

In GRB matches, you should keep your distance, and listen well to your RWR. Once you find a target that is not moving fast or is stationary, you should get very high, drop a bomb while lasing your chosen target, and after dropping, you should keep the altitude.

You should always destroy all other air superiority fighters before engaging in close air support.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Lots of flares
* Easy to flare missiles due to lack of afterburner
* Forgivable airframe. It can be thrown into a lot of situations and still come out on top even against more manoeuvrable targets
* Can use countermeasures, AAMs, and AGMs at the same time.
* Modern Avionics. Full Digital RWR, and gets access to modern HUD in the cockpit, helping players hit their target WAY easier in first person.

'''Cons:'''

* Lack of afterburner, making it a trans-sonic plane at most.
* Slightly unstable airframe due to flight model, making it wobbly in certain manoeuvres.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Super Étendard's history began in the late 1960s when France sought a replacement for its aging Étendard IV aircraft. Dassault Aviation designed the Super Étendard, introduced in the 1970s, as a carrier-based strike fighter. It featured a compact, agile airframe, advanced avionics, and a SNECMA Atar 8K-50 turbojet engine.

In 1982, during the Falklands War, the Super Étendard gained international recognition when it successfully hit the British destroyer HMS Sheffield with an Exocet missile, showcasing its maritime strike capabilities.

Exported to nations like Iraq and Argentina, it participated in various conflicts, serving roles from anti-ship strikes to ground attacks. The aircraft underwent upgrades over time but was eventually retired by France in 2016, making way for the Rafale M.
