== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

The French Super Mystère was designed, developed and manufactured by Dassault Aviation as a multi-role fighter-bomber, a niche which would later encompass such aircraft as the F-105 Thunderchief and the [[F-4C Phantom II|F-4C Phantom]] which could not be pigeon-holed into one type of combat role. The multi-role function created a combat multiplier with just one aircraft instead of needing several specialized aircraft to do certain jobs. A last-minute change of targets could allow for weapons change or multiple types of ordnance can be carried to take on one or more roles during a combat run.

The Super Mystère is the culminating aircraft in a series of four other predecessors before it. Initially starting with the Dassault Ouragan, modifications and upgrades led to the Mystère II, Mystère III and Mystère IV. The Mystère series fighters while quick could not go supersonic except during a dive whereas, like many of the newer aircraft of the time, the Super Mystère had swept wings which allowed it to achieve supersonic flight during level flight. Another plus to the Super Mystère was that its turbojet engine was equipped with an afterburner which earlier Mystère fighters did not have.

The {{PAGENAME}} can fulfil a multi-role function by either being a fighter-interceptor or a fighter-bomber. Outfitted with the afterburner, this fighter can easily become an interceptor either going after fighters or bombers. This fighter is outfitted with two 30 mm DEFA 552 autocannons as its main weapon and also can be fitted with SNEB type 23 rockets, T10 151 rockets, AA-20 Nord missiles or AIM-9B Sidewinder missiles for air to air combat. Though the rockets and missiles are not a guarantee that the enemy will be hit and go down, always be ready to follow up with the DEFA 552 as the enemy fighter will most likely be in an energy-drained situation and a relatively easy target to mop up with the autocannon.

Though relatively nimble and quick when outfitted for air-to-air combat, things change when switched to ground-pounding. The speed and manoeuvrability trade-off is worth it as this fighter converted to a bomber can carry a hefty payload for an aircraft of its size. Ground-attack rockets are a good option especially with the T10 151 or SNEB type 23 to focus on attacking lighter clustered targets. For direct bomb-to-target ordnance, the aircraft has the choice of outfitting either 1,000 or 2,000 lbs of bombs, enough to do serious damage to larger ships, hardened targets and bases.

The {{PAGENAME}} is a fighter/interceptor/bomber which newer pilots to supersonic jets can master quickly, especially with a playstyle they are comfortable with. Though not the fastest fighter, it has speed enough to not get out of control and depending on the playstyle of the pilot, air-to-air combat, air-to-ground combat or a mix of both are available options depending on the suspended weapons loadout allowing the pilot to take to the skies to destroy enemy targets and aid in whittling down the enemy's tickets towards victory.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} is a typical middle of the road jet fighter in terms of flight performance. With its swept wings, it has a distinct advantage over earlier fighters with straight wings, however, it is surpassed by those jets which can hit or hit close to Mach 2. Modifications and upgrades from earlier Mystère fighters moulded the {{PAGENAME}} into what it is, going from its swept wings and tailplanes to its strengthened wing spars all held together with titanium bolts. This aircraft is meant to go fast, meant to make high-g manoeuvres and to carry heavy payloads when required.

Outfitted with an afterburner, this fighter has decent acceleration and can achieve >Mach speed in level flight and even faster during a dive. This fighter does handle well during a dive and control stiffening does not begin until around 900 kph and starts to become severe around 1,050 kph. Though the wings have been reinforced for the greater weight loads, the wings can potentially shear off at around 1,265 kph. When carrying heavier loads such as the AN-M64A1 500 lb or AN-M65A1 1,000 lb bombs the overall manoeuvrability and acceleration of this aircraft will suffer, but not as bad as some of the other contemporary fighters in a similar situation.

Due to the possibility of being attacked by faster jet fighters, it is important to try to set up the enemy to overshoot the {{PAGENAME}} and one way to do that when being tailed is to reduce throttle, extend air brakes and manoeuvre to the right or left, if the chasing fighter cannot compensate to the Mystère's manoeuvres then they will zoom past, which will allow the {{PAGENAME}} to retract flaps, go full throttle and target the fleeing aircraft to attempt a firing solution.

While the acceleration in this aircraft is decent, the climb rate is quite good and this fighter does have a good bit of energy retention when coming out of a dive. When manoeuvring in this fighter, it is best to make short and quick movements rather than long turning manoeuvres to help conserve energy. This aircraft has an excellent roll rate and when aerial combat fighting, the style which lends the best to the strengths of the fighter is the Boom & Zoom manoeuvres.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 14 mm steel plate - front cockpit
* 14 mm steel plate - behind the pilot's seat
* 14 mm steel plate - behind the pilot's headrest (the two 14 mm plates butt up against each other effectively providing 28 mm total or 30 mm when adjusting for constructional armour slope angle)
* 40 mm bulletproof glass in canopy windshield

[[File:SuperMystereB2_001.jpg|450px|thumb|right|An X-ray view of the '''{{PAGENAME}}''' displaying the various armour protection in the aircraft.]]
The {{PAGENAME}} is a fighter which is in a unique position of being in a transitional period between the end of World War II and the Vietnam Era. Still holding onto some of the facets of a WW II fighter which later fighters eliminate, this French fighter has a decent amount of armour to protect the pilot, something later jets forgo to allow for more speed and to carry more ordnance. The pilot of the {{PAGENAME}} is well protected from the front with a bulletproof windscreen which due to its slope has an effective thickness of 67 mm. The huge gaping hole in the front of the aircraft sucking in copious amounts of air for the engine presents a problem, as, during head-on attacks, bullets potentially could fly right into the air intake and penetrate the cockpit with very little resistance. To combat this problem, the fighter has a 14 mm steel plate which blocks the entire front area of the cockpit area, protecting the pilot but leaving enough space for the air to get to the engine.

During attacks from behind, the pilot is again protected by two plates, one directly behind the seat and a second one behind the headrest with the combination of the two plates providing around 30 mm of protection. The rest of the critical components of the aircraft are left relatively unprotected with many fuel tanks in the wings, more in the fuselage surrounding the engine and the engine itself. When attacking this aircraft, the wings and centre fuselage provide the best areas of attack as they are most likely to hit a critical component or blow off a wing. Pilot sniping may be effective from the side, but trying to line up that shot will be difficult and the attacking pilot will have a better chance to hit the larger areas of the wings or fuselage.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|DEFA 552 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm DEFA 552 cannons, chin-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)

The {{PAGENAME}} like many of the fighters of the time got away from machine guns and were outfitted with autocannons, in this case, 30 mm DEFA 552 cannons. Lessons learned the hard way in other aircraft resulted in the lower fuselage under where the cockpit is, but behind the air-intake to the aircraft. This resulting location provided optimal fire control as convergence is not an issue, however, the pilot must still correct for bullet drop for the 30 mm rounds. Also, exhaust gasses from the cannons were not anywhere near air intake and did not threaten to choke out the engine as happened with the [[Hunter F.6]] or the [[MiG-19 (Family)|MiG-19]] fighters when their guns were fired and exhaust gasses were ingested into the air intakes. The two DEFA 552 cannons only have 150 rounds per gun which require the pilot to exercise trigger control so not to waste ammunition.

The {{PAGENAME}} was built to be a battlewagon of an aircraft, capable of fulfilling different roles as the mission dictated. This fighter has access to a multitude of both French and US armaments to round out its capabilities no matter what map it spawns on whether it is an air-to-air attack, ground-attack or both.

;Air-to-air attack

Most maps in War Thunder lend themselves to cater to air-to-air attacks, especially on domination maps with battles to control airfields. For this purpose, the {{PAGENAME}} and morph into the fighter-interceptor role and pursue fighters, attackers and bombers without discrimination. Specific weapons for air-to-air combat include:

* AIM-9B Sidewinder: The AIM-9B Sidewinder is an average early generation short-range guided missile which acquires and maintains contact with its target through an IR lens on the head of the missile. While being reasonably quick, this missile lags behind compared to later guided missiles in terms of agility, this missile is not very difficult to out-manoeuvre. It should be thus used more as a utility than a weapon, to make faster enemies bleed speed which will make it easier to take them out with your 30 mm DEFA cannons.
* AA-20 Nord: The AA-20, typically regarded as a stepping stone to future missiles, had many limitations in that it requires the pilot to guide the missile to its target through a command link. The missile's movement due to its fixed wings resulted in a steady roll rate, but guidance adjustments came through the combined efforts of the control system and gyroscope. Not the easy fire-and-forget style like the Sidewinder, this missile will take some skill and much practice to master.

;Air-to-ground attack

Converting this fighter-interceptor to a fighter-bomber is as easy as changing out the suspended armament types. Options here range from using dropped munition bombs or unguided rockets, fired either singly or in salvos depending on the type.

* AS-20 Nord: The AS-20 is a modified version of the AA-20 to convert it to an Air-to-Ground missile, largely the main change was adding a larger warhead and installing an impact fuse. Limitations for this missile are the same as the AA-20 being a command guidance control missile which results in the pilot's concentration during the launch and contact with the target phase resulting in a vulnerable aircraft.
* T10 151 rockets: These are unguided 68 mm rockets which are launched from a rocket pod. Typically rockets of this size are ineffective when fired singly, this rocket should be fired in salvos where chances are increased that one or more will hit the target. Best used against lighter vehicles, anti-aircraft guns and aircraft sitting on the airfield.
* 500 lb AN-M64A1 bomb: The AN-M64A1 is a good multi-purpose bomb which can have an effect on bases, but should be reserved for more hardened targets like fortified pill-boxes, medium to large tanks or vehicles which are clustered together.
* 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 Fin-M129 bomb: The AN-M51A1 is a heavy-hitting bomb which can do some serious damage to a base or other hardened targets. Though a waste against smaller and lighter targets, it can be effective when used against clustered targets (sometimes overkill).

;Multi-use attack

In combination with the 30 mm DEFA 552 cannons, the {{PAGENAME}} can be outfitted with SNEB type 23 unguided rockets which can be utilised with great effect both in the air and on the ground.

* SNEB type 23 rockets: The SNEB type 23 rockets area available in greater quantities than the T10 151's with numbers as great as 73. For air-to-air, these rockets are most effective when used against bomber aircraft as they are typically slower and a large target, perfect for a large salvo launch of type 23 rockets. When encountering lighter ground targets which are in relatively close proximity to each other large amounts of the SNEB type 23 rockets can cover large areas of ground with exploding rockets highly increasing the chances of hitting one or more targets in a single pass. These rockets can be considered an area denial weapon as when salvos are fired at an airfield, aircraft attempting to land intent on capturing the runway will most likely power up and abort the landing or risk the destruction of their aircraft.

Thanks to the many different options of suspended armaments available to this aircraft, options and roles can be mixed and matched to the pilot's desires and the map's available targets, for either air-to-air combat, ground-attack combat or a mixed-bag of both. The {{PAGENAME}} can be a jack-of-all-trades and when coming up against one, the attacking pilot making assumptions may find themselves rethinking the attack when the {{PAGENAME}} turns the tables.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Dassault {{PAGENAME}} is the result of many years of research and development, specifically learning lessons from earlier Mystère fighters. The result is a well-rounded fighter/interceptor/bomber aircraft which will have no problems finding a role on any map to maximize its potential. Suspended weapon options for this aircraft give it the potential for air-to-air combat, ground-attack combat or even a complementary mix of both types of weapons to go after targets of opportunity both in the air and on the ground. Though not a glamorous and well-known fighter such as those from other nations, the {{PAGENAME}} can be a diamond in the rough which can sneak its way up the leader board racking up destroyed aircraft, ground targets and even enemy bases.

For lack of better words, the {{PAGENAME}} in air-to-air combat can be a very effective face-puncher, in that it does quite well in head-to-head attacks. When lining up a head-on attack, a short burst from the dual 30 mm cannons is enough to send an enemy jet down in flames. Though a poor position to get a lock for the AIM-9B Sidewinders, head-on attacks are the perfect opportunity to unfurl an AA-20 Nord guided missile. During head-ons, since you are already flying toward an enemy pilot, the AA-20 can be launched and guided right into the path of the incoming fighter for what is typically a destroying blow.  The AIM-9B missiles should be reserved for slower aircraft such as strike aircraft, bombers and helicopters which typically cannot outmanoeuvre the missiles whereas faster fighters can break the missile lock with high-G manoeuvres. When faster fighters are on the {{PAGENAME}}'s tail, don't forget to reduce throttle, pop air brakes, drop combat flaps and manoeuvre to one side or the other, this will make it extremely difficult for the trailing enemy fighter to get a gun/missile solution and will typically overshoot, allowing the {{PAGENAME}} to raise flaps, close air brakes and increase throttle to get guns on the enemy fighter. Use this tactic only as a last resort because since the Super Mystère bleeds a lot of speed in turns, you may end up being too slow to gun the enemy down after they have overshot you. The Super Mystère cannot survive prolonged dogfights due to the low MER, but is very agile in high energy states, and can roll with ease, making it a very good plane to force an overshoot.

The {{PAGENAME}} has a wide array of ground-attack ordnance and can weasel its way into a battleground to take out targets ranging from soft anti-aircraft to heavy tanks and enemy bases. SNEB type 23 rockets are small, but used en masse can wreak havoc upon ground targets especially those which are clustered quite close together. Unguided rockets can also be especially useful against enemy fighters which may be attempting to capture an airfield as unlike bullets, the rockets only need to explode close to the aircraft to inflict damage. If the pilot elects to, they can become a fighter-bomber heavy mover and carry up to 2,000 lbs of bombs allowing for severe damage to be inflicted to heavier targets and bases. The pair of AS-20 Nord missiles are devastating to enemy ground vehicles and with their heavy payload and the overpressure mechanic, a direct hit isn't always necessary. They are guided with keyboard controls so you must be very accurate, as you have only 2 of these. The pilot needs to be aware that carrying the heavier ordnance will impact the aircraft's manoeuvrability and flight characteristics until the ordnance is released.

Being a middle-of-the-road fighter, the {{PAGENAME}} cannot take any other fighters for granted. Many enemy fighters will have a speed advantage and will be able to run circles around it, however, the Mystère must learn to drastically reduce its speed a times to force overshoots of both aircraft and missiles, however, they must be ready to counter the enemy or else they will just try to chase them down again. Though the {{PAGENAME}} may have a speed advantage over earlier fighters, that is no need to become complacent, the slower fighters can attempt the same strategy as the Mystère when going against faster aircraft and position for an overshoot, forcing the {{PAGENAME}} out front and within gun range. The {{PAGENAME}} is susceptible to missile fire (especially AIM-9 Sidewinders) and for [[Boom & Zoom]] fighters which seem to swoop in from out of nowhere to claim a victim. The critical thing for a {{PAGENAME}} pilot to do is to maintain their situational awareness, keep their speed up and look for targets of opportunity.

=== Radars ===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The Super Mystere B2 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

The Super Mystere B2 is a variant of the Dassault Super Mystère, the first supersonic aircraft in Western Europe to reach serial production. The aircraft was a development upon the previous MD.454 Mystère IV, featuring numerous improvements including a more powerful engine and a larger wing sweep. The Super Mystère began entering service in the late 1950s and served as the primary French fighter-bomber; the Super Mystère would remain in service until the late 1970s.

The Super Mystère represents the final evolution of the Dassault Ouragan / Mystère family which began with the first flight of the Ouragan prototype in early 1949. Compared to the previous Mystère IV, the Super Mystère included numerous improvements: notably, the wing sweep was increased to 45 degrees (compared to the Mystère IV's 41 degree sweep), and the installation of a new afterburning engine. The first Super Mystère prototype flew on March 2nd, 1954, and broke the sound barrier the following day.

In 1957, the Super Mystère entered service as the Super Mystère B.2: the main change compared to the prototypes was the fitting of a new, more powerful SNECMA Atar 101G engine. In total, 180 Super Mystère B2s would be built, serving as the primary French fighter-bomber & attack aircraft until the late 1970s. Additionally, 24 Super Mystères were sold to Israel in 1958. These aircraft would fight in the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War, and some of the aircraft would be sold to Honduras in the late 1970s.

=== [[wt:en/news/6093-development-super-myst%C3%A8re-b-2-over-the-barrier-en|Devblog]] ===
The Super Mystère was the final aircraft of the Mystère family of jet fighters, whose development history began with the creation of the Dassault Ouragan in the late 1940s. Featuring a modified design over the preceding Mystère 4 and being fitted with the new Rolls-Royce Avon afterburning turbojet engine, the resulting Super Mystère B.1 prototype became the first French supersonic jet fighter after conducting its maiden flight in March 1955.

Following the successful maiden flight of the prototype of the Super Mystère, a more refined production version of the machine was created shortly afterwards. Known as the Super Mystère B.2, the production version of the aircraft featured the SNECMA Atar 101G engine, compared to the Rolls-Royce Avon found on the prototype.

The Super Mystère B.2 entered production in 1956, with an initial contract for 150 aircraft being signed. By the end of production in 1959, around 180 Super Mystère B.2s were built out of a planned 370 units.

Entering service with the French Air Force in 1957, the Super Mystère B.2 served with French units for a good two decades before being replaced by newer and more advanced machines. Apart from its own forces, the Super Mystère B.2 was also exported and used by foreign operators. Most notably, Israel fielded some 24 Super Mystères, which had successfully proven themselves in action during the Six-Day and Yom-Kippur wars.

As the Super Mystère was slowly being phased out of French and Israeli service, Israel sold around a dozen of its Super Mystères to Honduras. In service with Honduras, the Super Mystères undertook their final missions as part of actions against Nicaraguan forces during border skirmishes before being ultimately decommissioned in  1996.
