The Swift is a British subsonic jet fighter. The aircraft is considered by some users to be a "Mini [[Hunter F.1|Hunter]]" as the Swift shares a lot of strengths and weaknesses with the beast.

This jet's strengths consist of good acceleration, climb rate and top speed, which if used properly can make it a brutal 'Boom and Zoom' aircraft, as even a short burst from the dual ADEN 30 mm revolver cannons will shred anything unfortunate enough to be in the way. The jet also has good energy retention, allowing it to make a 'swift' getaway if the pilot doesn't manage to kill their target, as even in a gentle climb it does not bleed speed as fast as other jets of its tier.

The main weakness of the jet is that it is not very manoeuvrable, meaning that if caught in a sticky situation, the Swift is unlikely to be able to out-dogfight its opponent unless the pilot is very experienced. Try to escape a dogfight before it begins, but if you are forced to engage, avoid throwing the jet into any sort of tight horizontal manoeuvres as there are very few aircraft the Swift will out-turn and you will end up losing any energy you may have had, becoming a sitting duck for whoever decides to claim the kill. Instead, when manoeuvring take advantage of oblique and vertical planes as you will have much more control over your energy, as well as making it easier to search for an escape route. If you manage to escape a dogfight, extend out using the Swift's acceleration and get some distance, then you can decide whether to re-engage. Also, be careful in dives. The Swift is a fast plane and as such, in a full-on boom dive from the heavens, you are likely to be going at around 1,100 km/h (700 mph) IAS, which is great for taking out unaware enemies who haven't seen you. At this point, however, the Swift is at its least manoeuvrable, at this speed turning and pulling up takes a very long time, and many new Swift pilots will find themselves embedded in the nearest hillside after a dive, take the time to learn the limits of the plane and know when to pull up. The Swift also has no designed air brake, instead the jet is equipped with the strongest takeoff flaps in the game, which still manage to hold together at the top speed of the plane, they do a great job of ditching unwanted speed, even in a steep dive, so use them if you feel you are coming in too fast.

Another minor weakness of the Swift is the fact that the two ADENs fire very quickly, expending all 400 rounds in about 10 seconds, so in an extended battle you may find yourself clean out of bullets, at which point you'll either escape and rearm, or become a sitting duck for the nearest fully loaded transonic fighter who sees you.

To summarise, use the Swift as a 'Boom and Zoomer', avoid horizontal dogfights, watch your speed in dives, and make sure to keep an eye on your ammo count, do all this and you'll be sure to quickly get many kills under your belt.

===Radars===
<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->
The Swift F.1 is equipped with an ARI.5857 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.
It will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great acceleration, climb rate and high top speed
* Decent energy retention, but not the best at it (especially against MiG-15/17)
* Fast firing 30 mm ADEN cannons
* MC 1,000 lb bombs and RP-3 rockets available for light CAS roles
* Very responsive airframe both on roll and instant turning
* Take-off flaps have a high rip speed and can work as airbrakes when needed

'''Cons:'''

* Low manoeuvrability compared to other fighters in its battle rating; better at boom and zoom than dogfights
* Compression and wing rip risk at high speed (>925 km/h IAS)
* Very poor flight performance when stock
* Has no air brakes for landing; must use take-off flaps to reduce speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In the years following the end of WW2, Great Britain focused their efforts on rebuilding their nation from the devastation caused by the war as the British government didn't consider a new war possible in the following ten years. Under these circumstances, developing new military technology wasn't considered a priority in most cases.

As a result, Great Britain found itself lagging behind in military aviation at the start of the 1950s by the outbreak of the Korean War. This prompted the RAF to hastily look for a new fighter aircraft to put into service, even if it meant taking into consideration an interim design.

One of the designs that sparked the RAF's interest was a new swept-wing aircraft developed by the Supermarine company - the Type 510. Being in essence just a modified Supermarine Attacker, development of this design continued, eventually maturing into the Type 541.

Soon, the Type 541 received the highest development priority and was hastily rushed through testing and into production as the Supermarine Swift. In fact, production was so rushed that it began before necessary design changes could even be applied from the results of the test flights conducted with the Type 541 prototypes.

Nonetheless, the Supermarine Swift F.1 entered service with the RAF in February 1954, followed shortly afterwards by the F.2 variant. However, many of the aircraft's teething problems weren't resolved as a result of being rushed into production. This resulted in a number of accidents happening early on involving the Swift, leading to the aircraft being grounded for a time.

Newer modifications were developed, which addressed most of the known issues. However, it was a case of too little too late for the Swift, as it quickly became replaced by the Hawker Hunter. In the end, just under 200 Supermarine Swifts were produced out of the close to 500 planned aircraft. The Swift was phased out of active service relatively quickly after its introduction, with the last fighter models being withdrawn by the RAF in the mid to late 1950s.
