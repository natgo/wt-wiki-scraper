== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is an improved version of the Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bomber. It is equipped with eight underwing pylons that allow it to carry the AP Mk I rocket and the famous RP-3 rocket.

It was introduced during [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6703-event-winner-vehicles-for-the-victory-anniversary-en|2020 "Victory Day"]] event. The Swordfish Mk II can be helpful for inexperienced players who want to learn how to effectively destroy ground targets using bombs and unguided rockets. This is due to its low speed and excellent manoeuvrability, which make it easier for new players to aim and target ground units accurately.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

While the Swordfish Mk II boasts a good stall speed, performing sharp turns will bleed your speed at an alarming rate. Under no circumstances should you attempt a steeply banked turn near the ground as you will lose a lot of altitude in the process. Instead, perform a shallow banked turn with the assistance of the rudder.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Vickers E (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 7.7 mm Vickers E machine gun, nose-mounted (600 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|G.P. Mk.IV (250 lb)|G.P. Mk.IV (500 lb)|AP Mk I|RP-3|18 inch Mark XII (450 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 4 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,000 lb total)
* 6 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,500 lb total)

* 1 x 450 mm 18 inch Mark XII torpedo
* 8 x AP Mk I rockets
* 8 x RP-3 rockets

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Vickers K (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 7.7 mm Vickers K machine gun, dorsal turret (600 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This aircraft will ultimately be outperformed by any aircraft it faces, so its key strength is the payload. Most noticeably, the RP-3 rockets which can be fired independently of each other is sufficient to attack light pillboxes and light to medium tanks, even at higher tiers!

In air RB, try to avoid getting into air combat as your weaponry is insufficient. When it comes to defending yourself, you really don't have much of a choice. Your machine guns are inadequate and most players would shrug off your spray. The recommendation is to always have a teammate keeping an eye on you as you do your duties

In Ground RB, spawn only if you think that the enemy does not have anti-aircraft vehicles in battle since your slow speed makes it easy for the enemy to shoot you down!

In Naval battles, you should only engage naval targets when you think the target is distracted (for example, while they're attacking an allied ship).

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Allows the use of WEP, unlike the Mk I, as well as a larger oil cooler
* Very versatile with multiple payload options
* Excellent stall speed of 96 km/h
* Surprisingly good turning radius for a bomber
* Rockets can be fired off independently, starting on the left wing

'''Cons:'''

* Engine has less horsepower than the Mk I - very slow without WEP!
* Poorer climb rate than the Mk I
* Clumsier/bulkier than the Mk I
* Sharp turns bleeds speed at an alarming rate
* Inadequate defence weaponry
* Large minimum fuel load (>40 minutes)

[[File:Rocket Swordfish.jpg|thumb|Three rocket-armed Fairey Swordfishes on a training flight, circa 1943.]]
The Swordfish is the second variant of the legendary Fairey Swordfish, the primary carrier-based torpedo bomber of the Royal Air Force. Despite being extremely obsolete by the outbreak of the Second World war, the Swordfish remained a crucial asset to the Fleet Air Arm. It was involved in many notable engagements, including the hunt for ''Bismarck'' and attack on Taranto. The Mk II variant was introduced in 1943, and featured the ability to mount rockets on underwing brackets.<ref name=":0">Navy Wings. (2020)</ref>

=== Design and development ===
The Fairey Swordfish was developed as an advanced variant of the earlier Fairey III, with the working name of TSR (Torpedo Spotting Reconnaissance) 1. The TSR-1 model was unsuccessful, and so a second TSR-2 model was developed - this model would eventually enter service as the actual Swordfish.<ref name=":0" /> The aircraft first flew in 1934, and entered service with the Royal Navy in 1936. However, it was already obsolete by the time it entered service, due to its biplane design and slow speed. Despite this, the aircraft still entered service in large numbers.

The aircraft, being designed for operation on aircraft carrier decks, was equipped with folding wings.<ref name=":0" /> It was powered by the Bristol Pegasus, a 9-cylinder radial that was state-of-the-art when the Swordfish entered service. Despite the powerful engine, the Swordfish could only reach 90 knots (166 km/h) unloaded.<ref name=":0" /> The crew of three sat in an open cockpit that provided minimal protection against both flak and weather. The aircraft was armed with two rifle-calibre guns (one firing forward and one firing backwards), and could carry up to 1,500 lbs of bombs, mines, torpedoes or rockets.<ref name=":0" />

=== Operational history ===
The Swordfish, despite being extremely obsolete by the start of the Second World War, engaged in a multitude of conflicts. The aircraft played a key role in the Attack on Taranto in November of 1940, which crippled the Italian fleet and would later be used by the Japanese as a blueprint for Pearl Harbour.<ref name=":0" /> Swordfishes were also responsible for crippling the battleship ''Bismarck'', which was later sunk by British surface ships. During its time with the Fleet Air Arm, the Swordfish was affectionately nicknamed the 'Stringbag', a reference to the shopping bags used at the time; this referenced the Swordfish's ability to carry almost any ordnance that the FAA could fit on it.<ref name=":0" />

The Swordfish Mk II was developed as the second Swordfish iteration and was first introduced in 1943. It was fitted with a new, metal lower wing section, allowing it to carry rockets on underwing racks.<ref name=":0" /> The Swordfish Mk II saw extensive service as a convoy escort, in the Atlantic and in the Arctic. During the course of the Second World War, the Swordfish distinguished itself as a highly reliable reconnaissance and torpedo bomber aircraft. The aircraft sank 21 submarines, numerous surface ships, and was responsible for the highest tonnage of Axis shipping destroyed by a single Allied aircraft type.<ref name=":0" /> Several Swordfishes still exist today, including a flight-capable Swordfish Mk II operated by Navy Wings.<ref name=":0" />
