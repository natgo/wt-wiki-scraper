== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a torpedo bomber deployed by Sweden in the interwar period. The T 2 was originally an He 115 A-2; 12 aircraft operated under Sweden's command, with the numbers 101-112. At the outbreak of World War II, another six bombers were bought from Germany. The T 2 was well liked by its crews and it served until 1952, it was a key element to maintain Sweden's neutrality during WWII. The aircraft not only acted as a torpedo bomber, it also carried regular bombs and was used for long-range reconnaissance. Of the original 12 He 115A-2, five aircraft were lost due to accidents in missions.

It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]]. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a very slow and mediocre bomber overall, although you do have the ability to land in the water with the floats. It is an interesting pick for ground battles and naval battles, but not suited for air RB. In air RB, it will be massacred by most fighters, since its defensive armament is inferior to most aircraft, and the fact that it is a very large bomber. However, for ground battles, the 450 kg bomb or even the 250 kg bombs are very capable of destroying tanks with precise drops, while the torpedo is very good to destroy destroyers in naval battles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Can hold torpedoes
* Can capture points in Naval Battles
* Potent defensive armament in a downtier
* Good payload options
* Can stay airworthy for a given amount of time with one engine

'''Cons:'''

* Mediocre overall performance
* Very slow
* Big target
* Gunners are in terrible positions
* Will be outgunned in many situations
* Little armor protection, will be brought down from few shots of higher-caliber guns

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
