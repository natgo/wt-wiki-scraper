The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

After World War II, Japan was left without any modern jet fighters for defensive purposes. Around 1955 the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) put into motion the development of a supersonic jet aircraft due to the Fuji T-1 trainer's lack of proper training in supersonic flight. Japan had purchased front-line Mach 2 fighters such as the F-104 Starfighter and the [[F-4C_Phantom_II|F-4EJ]] Phantom. However, their pilots had difficulty handling them, and a new trainer aircraft was needed.

Built as a trainer aircraft, the trainee pilot and instructor sat in tandem with the instructor in the rear-raised seat. With an instructor pilot in the aircraft, Japan was now ready to train its pilots in high-speed fighter usage properly. The {{PAGENAME}} paved the way for Japan's development and production of their first supersonic military fighter, the Mitsubishi F-1.

The {{PAGENAME}} features dual Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries TF40-IHI-801A engines, which are license-built Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour turbofans, the same utilised in the Jaguar fighters. The {{PAGENAME}}, for the most part, was manufactured with aircraft aluminium alloys. However, it did selectively use titanium for extra strength in certain areas. Shaped more like a dart than the stout Jaguar, the {{PAGENAME}} was built for speed, though to help with manoeuvrability, the wings do not house fuel tanks and feature leading-edge root extensions (LERX) and full-span leading-edge slats on the wings to aid in creating a higher angle of attack or higher lift capacity, especially helpful during slow flight. The {{PAGENAME}} opted to eliminate ailerons and instead utilise twin spoilers for roll control. Like many modern fighters, the tail portion of the aircraft featured an all-moving tailplane and airbrakes were outfitted to allow for slowing the aircraft down either in manoeuvres or when preparing for landing.

[[File:T-2 sgko 002.png|250px|thumb|left|{{PAGENAME}} fighter on the hunt in air-to-air attack configuration.]]

The {{PAGENAME}} is an aggressive fighter aircraft and features a single 20 mm Vulcan cannon which requires a brief spin-up before ammunition begins to fire, thus does not have an instantaneous fire with trigger depress, which will take a pilot time to get used to and preplan shots to allow for the gun to spool-up in time to get shots off at a high-speed target. AIM-9E Sidewinder air-to-air missiles round out the air attack arsenal and are highly effective missiles. However, a clever (and lucky) pilot can outmanoeuvre the Sidewinders, though, typically, the enemy fighter is then left in a compromising situation and can be easily dispatched with the cannon.

Rockets mounted on the {{PAGENAME}} bridge the gap between air-attack and ground-attack, allowing the fighter to either hammer bombers with the rockets or ground targets such as trucks, anti-aircraft batteries and ships. For a dedicated ground attack, the {{PAGENAME}} can be outfitted with two different bombs, namely the 500 and 750 lb bombs of which are the aerodynamic LDGP form type bombs. Though not built to be a fighter-bomber like the [[F-4C_Phantom_II|F-4C]], the Japanese fighter loses some of its hard-earned manoeuvrability while carrying bombs (hence the fuel tanks not being in the wings), however once released, the {{PAGENAME}} can be back in the aerial mix as long as it has the speed to do so.

Though developed as a training aircraft, the {{PAGENAME}} is a formidable foe that is fast, sleek and can carry a one-two punch which can easily knock out enemy aircraft unfortunate enough to race through the Japanese fighters crosshairs.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
[[File:T-2 duckmcmallardson 001.png|250px|thumb|right|{{PAGENAME}} on coastal patrol.]]
The {{PAGENAME}} was designed and built for one main purpose, and that was to train pilots in flight at around Mach 1.4 in preparation for flying faster Mach 2+ fighters such as the F-4EJ, F-104, and the Mitsubishi F-1. With a long narrow body, short main wings without fuel tanks and an all-moving tailplane, this aircraft was built streamlined like the F-104 to get you from point A to point B in the shortest amount of time possible and not spend too much time manoeuvring. While excelling as an interceptor, this fighter will still hold its own in a manoeuvring fight, granted as long as under-wing armaments are limited to the Sidewinder missiles and not the heavy bombs.

The sleekness of the aircraft lends itself to flying fast, and speed should be maintained when flying, especially during air-to-air combat, as a slow-flying {{PAGENAME}} is a relatively easy target due to poor manoeuvrability at slow speeds. To help in instances where the aircraft must fly at slower speeds (landing, bombing and ground rocket attack), slats and spoilers help create a higher lift capacity and roll rate, preventing the aircraft from stalling and plummeting.

Air-to-air combat should be avoided when carrying bomb loads, as this will significantly decrease manoeuvrability. During a ground attack, all efforts should be made to get to the target as soon as possible and release the heavy ordnance and then proceed to any aerial combat in the near vicinity.

Damage to the aircraft, especially to the wings, will typically result in the destruction of the aircraft. Due to their relatively small size, any loss in surface area will cause the fighter to over-lift on the good side, sending the aircraft into a roll and then potentially into a flat spin.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 38 mm bulletproof glass - situated between the fore and aft cockpits

The {{PAGENAME}} fighter, like many more modern aircraft, have shed most of its armour instead of more speed and agility. The only armour outfitted on this aircraft is the 38 mm bulletproof glass situated between the fore and aft cockpit, giving the rear pilot a pretty good chance of surviving an impact or bullet strike which might take out the front pilot. Beyond that, the aircraft's survivability is a mix of engineering and the pilot's skill. Damage sustained to the wings will not affect fuel loss as no tanks are mounted here; they are only mounted within the aircraft's fuselage. While many aircraft can absorb a huge amount of ammunition rounds in the fuselage before losing something important when it comes to the {{PAGENAME}} fuselage hits typically result in a hit to the engines, oil coolers, fuel, pilots or the radar. This is where pilot skill and manoeuvring come into play to make it very difficult for an enemy pilot to get a firing solution. High-G manoeuvres within this aircraft may hurt the speed and manoeuvrability; however, it may save the pilot's lives by causing many missiles such as the AIM Sidewinders to miss due to their lower g-turn threshold.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|JM61A1 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm JM61A1 cannon, chin-mounted (750 rpg)

[[File:T-2 der thunderer 001.jpg|250px|thumb|right|{{PAGENAME}} sporting a user-created skin.]]
The JM61A1 20 mm Vulcan cannon is a monster and, at the same time, a headache for new pilots not used to it. Unlike most other machine guns and cannons in the game (or in real life, for that matter), trigger depression here does not immediately produce flying bullets. Due to the characteristics of the JM61A1 cannon, it requires an initial spool-up time or spin of the cannon barrels before ammunition can be fired. The high rate of fire can easily melt the barrel, however with the rotating barrels, each barrel can cool off enough before it is its turn again to prevent damage. To initiate this, trigger depression will result in a .25 second delay before the ammunition begins to fire to allow for the barrels to get to proper rotating speed. Once it gets going, 750 rounds of ammunition do not last very long.

When targeting an aircraft, for example, the pilot must remember this formula to be successful while leading an aircraft or before an aircraft passes through the crosshairs, start squeezing the trigger about .5 to .25 seconds before that event, and the cannon rounds should land on target. Waiting until a target passes through the crosshairs (unless tailing them) will result in a miss as they will be out of the sights before the cannon starts firing.

Trigger discipline is necessary when using this cannon as due to its rate of fire (about 6,000 RPM, ~100 RPS or 7.5 seconds of ammunition) will easily blow through the 750 rounds carried by the {{PAGENAME}}.

=== Suspended armament ===

===Radars===
{{main|AN/APS-21|AN/APG-26}}
The Mitsubishi T-2 is equipped with an [[AN/APS-21]] search radar, as well as an [[AN/APG-26]] target tracking radar. Both radars are located in the nose of the aircraft.

[[File:T-2 jonigustavo 001.png|250px|thumb|right|The dart-shaped {{PAGENAME}} hugging the terrain in attempt to catch enemy fighters unaware.]]

'''Pros:'''

* Faster and better acceleration than many jets at its BR
* High climb rate
* 2 pilots (not as vulnerable to pilot snipes)
* Devastating JM61A1 rotary cannon
* Variety of air-to-ground and multirole payloads
* Decent PD radar that can detect up to 60 km away, useful in large maps to find targets

'''Cons:'''

* A lack of any [[:Category:Countermeasures|Countermeasures]] make it an easy kill in its BR, where [[air-to-air missiles]] are common
* Poor energy retention, low-speed manoeuvrability and large turning radius make avoiding missiles and dogfighting extremely challenging if often impossible
* A lack of [[Ballistic Computer]] limits the use of the air-to-ground munitions
* The JM61A1 rotary cannon may take getting used to as it doesn't fire immediately but has a short spool up time before it starts firing, and it has a very limited amount of ammunition
* Burns through fuel at an astronomical rate
* Mediocre AIM-9E missile

Soon after WW2, Japan was mostly offered jet fighter aircraft from the USAAF / USAF, such as the later versions of the [[F-86F-40_(Japan)|F-86 Sabre]], to protect itself from threats such as North Korea, which was at the time in conflict with the United States (in the 1950s). In the late '50s and '60s, Japan had already developed its first modern jet-aircraft, the Fuji T-1, which was mainly used as a trainer aircraft. But by the '70s, it was obsolete; Japan needed a new trainer aircraft, which could train pilots for near Mach 2 speeds.

During the time between 1964-1965, engineers at Mitsubishi began working on a project called "T-X", which would be either a 1 or 2 seater aircraft that would later be developed into another project for a ground attack aircraft called the "SF-X".

Simultaneously, the United States offered Japan the T-38, and Britain/France offered the SEPECAT Jaguar for investigation. Japan thought of a project of license-building these aircraft, which has later failed due to issues between SEPECAT and the Japanese Imperial Family.

In 1967, Japanese aircraft manufacturers Fuji, Kawasaki and Mitsubishi proposed their designs for the XT-2, of which Mitsubishi's design was accepted. The prototype (pre-production model) would be built in 1971, seeing its maiden flight on July 20 1971, flown by Dr. Kenji Ikeda.

The XT-2 became the first Japanese-built aircraft to break the sound barrier in level flight. It was put into final production later that year.

The variants of the final model, the T-2 were: T-2Z (early model that later ended up being modified for the SF-X program), T-2A and T-2B (trainer models) and the T-2K, the armed model, carrying a 20 mm M-61 Vulcan fast-firing autocannon. The aircraft was produced until 1988 and was retired in 2006 along with its fighter variant, the F-1 when it was replaced by its successor, the Kawasaki T-4 (the Mitsubishi F-2 Viper Zero replaced the F-1).
