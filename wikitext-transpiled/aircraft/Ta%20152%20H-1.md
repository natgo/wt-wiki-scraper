== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

While the Ta 152 H-1 is the ultimate evolution of the Fw 190, the [[Ta 152 C-3]] takes the Fw 190's concepts to their limit. Don't be dissuaded however, the H-1 is a different beast altogether. Fast, manoeuvrable, and stable past 350 km/h, it is more nimble than most enemies at its BR, has a decent climb rate, short turn time (especially with landing flaps), and above average roll rate. The Ta 152 H-1 trades the incredible roll rate of the Fw 190 for a great energy retention and turnfighting ability. You will outclimb most competitors and will usually have an altitude advantage due to the interceptor airspawn.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 30 mm MK 108 cannon, nose-mounted (90 rpg)
* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, wing-mounted (175 rpg = 350 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ta 152 H-1 is a high altitude fighter with a wide wingspan and good manoeuvrability. Unlike its heavier cousin the [[Ta 152 C-3]], the H-1's best performance is reached when flying above 9,000 m (~30,000 ft) altitude as this is where the engine performs at maximum efficiency. A Ta 152 H-1 with altitude advantage is a deadly force to be reckoned with, having a great dive speed and energy retention, making it an efficient Hit and Run plane. With an interceptor airspawn, the climbing phase is shortened. However, the pilot must be aware of planes with a high climb rate like Spitfires or P-51s, as they can absolutely possess an altitude advantage at first contact, despite having to take off from the ground.

Even though the Ta 152 H-1 is an high altitude fighter, it can still perform at medium and low altitudes. Being quite manoeuvrable, it can do well in a dogfight against certain opponents, as you can quickly turn the tide of a dogfight due to your MER and good turn rate with combat flaps. However, some nimbler opponents will outmanoeuvre it easily if they possess an energy advantage. In these situations, it is best for the Ta 152 H-1 to use its primary strengths (speed, turning, and manoeuvring energy retention (MER)), to gain the upper hand. Another role for the Ta 152 H-1 is the interception of heavy bombers at high altitude. Even if the bomber is trying to escape, the Ta 152 H-1 will quickly catch up thanks to its powerful engine.

The armament of the Ta 152 H-1 is fairly powerful: the Minengeschoß-firing 30 mm MK 108 and 2 x 20 mm MG 151 have enough power to inflict heavy damage on most targets it will encounter. Though be aware that the MK 108 only has 90 rounds at its disposal and is most efficient at close range. Meanwhile, the two MG 151 have 175 rounds per gun for a total of 350 rounds, and can be used with much more liberty.

Enemies to be aware of in the Ta 152 H-1 are opponents such as the [[Spitfire F Mk 24]], [[F8F (Family)|F8F]], [[P-51H-5-NA]], [[F2G-1]] and [[Ki-84 (Family)|Ki-84]]. These foes can intercept and force the Ta 152 H-1 into dogfights on equal terms, trying to gain an energy or altitude advantage is key before engagement with these aircraft.

'''Pros:'''

* 30 mm cannon usually obliterates enemies upon impact, and serves well in bomber interception
* Stable in all axes (joystick), and fairly nimble in a turn (mouse aim)
* Good armour layout protects both the pilot and engine, strong in head-ons
* GM-1 engine boost gives outstanding performance above 7,000 m, at these altitudes a good pilot can go head to head with any foe
* Combat flaps rip off at 700 km/h, which means you can use them at almost any speed
* Above average turnfighter for Germany, landing flaps increase turn so much that you can keep up with most fighters; even some Spitfires
* Has some of the best manoeuvring energy retention (MER) performance in the game, it will easily win a prolonged dogfight with good usage of flaps
* Excellent diver, wings only rip past 870 km/h (540 mph)
* Decently fast on the deck, can reach 580 km/h (360 mph) and will catch most enemies in a straight chase
* Very fast at high altitude (>7 km); at 12,200 m the Ta 152 H-1 will reach 755 km/h (469 mph), making it the fastest single engine German prop fighter

'''Cons:'''

* 30 mm cannon is low-velocity, making it hard to hit
* Has a tendency to snap roll viciously, especially in a stall
* Very strong brakes, will easily flip over if not used sparingly, and is thus slower to land than most aircraft
* Losing your flaps through gunfire or otherwise is a massive detriment to turning performance and hampers your ability to dogfight effectively
* Despite having an above average roll rate, it is made significantly worse by pitching up/down
* Average climb rate, even with the airspawn it can be difficult to attain an altitude advantage over foes such as the Spitfire
* Below average ammo capacity, good trigger discipline is a must with the Ta 152 H
* Long wings increase chance of collision with enemy aircraft, especially in head-ons
* Poor parasite drag to thrust ratio, meaning a lot of energy is lost in diving attacks due to wing surface area
* No external payload options or HVAP shells on the MK 108, making this strictly an air superiority plane

Throughout much of World War II in Europe, the German Luftwaffe was only concerned with their aircraft flying in the mid to low altitudes (20,000 ft/6,100 m and below), therefore a majority of their fighter fleet only utilized a single-stage supercharger which was sufficient for their role. However, with the introduction of the [[B-29A-BN|B-29]], the threat of this type of bomber would have been out of reach for most of the German air fleet.<ref name="Militaryfactory" /> To counter high-altitude allied fighters and bombers, the Fw 190D-9 was modified with a two-stage supercharged Junkers Jumo 213E engine which allowed it to achieve the higher altitudes, however, the shorter stubby wings well know for low altitude manoeuvrability actually hindered performance at altitude, though usable, not really a suitable fix.<ref name="Historyofwar" />

Answering the call of the German Air Ministry (RLM – Reichsluftfahrtministerium), Focke-Wulf modified their Fw 190 design and branched out in three directions. The three prototypes, in turn, had one to become the new existing Fw 190D (Ta 152A) series (after the D-9), the second prototype would become a dedicated high-altitude bomber (Ta 152B) while the third would become a ground-attack aircraft (Ta 152H).<ref name="Historyofwar" />  Though adjustments and modifications were made including usage of a different engine, the ultimate results determined these aircraft did not provide enough improvement to continue moving forward and both the Ta 152A and B projects were cancelled. One bright spot from this was that the airframe built for the Ta 152B (the V21 airframe) showed promise and efforts were focused here to create the Ta 152C prototype.

In 1944 the RLM made a ruling that new fighter aircraft were to include the chief designer's name in the aircraft's designation. What was earlier knows as a Focke-Wulf aircraft was now listed with the prefix Ta which was short for ''Kurt Tank'', though Tank was still working for Focke-Wulf at the time.

Adjustments to the Fw 190D-9 fuselage resulted in its extension and addition of hydraulics to control the flaps and landing gear. These adjustments threw off the normal center of gravity and made the aircraft off balance, resulting in the lengthening of the nose of the aircraft to normalize the CoG. The length of the wings was slightly lengthened and due to shortages in aluminium, steel spars were utilized aiding to the strength of the wings, but also at a price of extra weight.<ref name="Historyofwar" />

;Ta 152C variant

The Ta 152 C-3 ended up with wings .5 m (1.25 ft) longer than the standard Fw 190D-9 to aid in supporting the new steel spars and hydraulic hardware in the landing gear and flaps. The 'C' variant did not incorporate a pressurized cockpit. While designed to work at lower altitudes (though above 25,000 ft or 6,100 m), the fighter was outfitted with a single 30 mm MK 108 Motorkanone which was mounted  through the center propeller hub with four MG 151/20 mm cannons, two of which were mounted in the upper fuselage and two more with one in each wing.<ref name="Militaryfactory" /> This cannon setup is enough to devastate any aircraft which is on the receiving end of the 20 and 30 mm rounds. The Ta 152 C-3 entered the war too late and in too little numbers to make an effective difference. Shortages in replacement parts became extremely difficult if not impossible to find reducing the ability of the Ta 152 C-3 to be used to the fullest of its abilities.<ref name="Historyofwar" />

;Ta 152H variant

The Ta 152 H-1 was refined to be more of a high-altitude fighter even so over the Ta 152C. Wings were extended a full length of 14.4 m (47.4 ft), though this lowered its overall speed, it provided substantial improvement with high-altitude handling. To aid the pilots in the higher altitude flights, the H variant was outfitted with a pressurized cockpit. The cockpit was pressurized to approximately a level comparable with 8,000 m (26,250 ft) and the canopy was comprised of two layers of which the outer was a thicker material with a thinner inner pane. To compensate for any moisture which could form between the panes, silica gel was added to aid in stemming any fogging. Unlike the 'C' variant, the 'H' only utilized a single 30 mm MK 108 Motorkanone firing through the propeller hub along with just two MG 151/20 mm autocannons, both of which were mounted in the upper fuselage. Eliminating the two wing-mounted cannons aided in increased manoeuvrability and less weight to make up for some of the additional weight added due to the pressurized cockpit system.

Overall the Ta 152H variant was one of the fastest piston-engine fighters to emerge during World War II, cruising around 750 km/h (465 mph) while at around 10,200 m (33,000 ft). The Ta 152H also employed the usage of GM-1 nitrous oxide boost and MW 50 methanol-water boost to briefly increase performance in the aircraft and if necessary, both could be applied at the same time.<ref name="Militaryfactory" />

The Ta 152 was, without a doubt, the best aircraft designed by Kurt Tank for Focke-Wulf. The aircraft was a further redesign of the venerable Fw 190, namely of the Fw 190 D. The Ta 152 became possible thanks to the new high-altitude Jumo 213 and DB 603 engines.

Development began in the winter of 1942-1943, when RLM's technical department released specifications for a new 'Spezial Jaeger', or Special Fighter. The fighter was to be capable of a high-altitude interceptor role. The Ta 152 H-1 was armed with a MK 108 cannon with 85 rounds firing through the propeller hub and two MG 151/20 cannons (220 rounds per gun) in the wings. The H-1 went into serial production in January or February of 1945. A total of only 70 or so were produced, of which very few made it to front-line service.
