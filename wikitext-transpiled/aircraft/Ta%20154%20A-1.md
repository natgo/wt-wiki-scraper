== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].  The Ta 154 A-1 is part of the [[Affiliate_Program_Revenue_Share|revenue share program]] and was created by Vitaly "NovA29R" Vostokov (model) and Michael "__StrafeMike__"  Ioannidis (texture).

The Ta 154 A-1 has very powerful frontal armament, placed in the fuselage, which can give you quick and easy kills. Unfortunately, it doesn't turn very well at low speeds so it is recommended to keep your speed up and Boom & Zoom. Turning should be a last resort. If you try to get an edge in a turn-fight using your flaps, you should watch your speed as your flaps can break off very easily at speeds above 450 km/h (279 mph). The roll-rate of the Ta 154 is almost as good as the Fw 190's roll-rate, this is due to the fact that there are no fuel tanks in the wings. This advantage can and should most definitely be used when flying evasively but when at low altitude, do periodically check what's in front of you.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 30 mm MK 108 cannons, fuselage-mounted (110 rpg = 220 total)
* 2 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons, fuselage-mounted (200 rpg = 400 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ta 154 A-1 is best played either as a boom-and-zoom fighter or as a bomber interceptor. At the start of a battle, climbing is recommended. From there, you can either go after lone bombers or dive on unsuspecting fighters below you.

Beware of fighters such as P-47s, P-51s, Yaks, Spitfires, and J2Ms as they can outclimb you, and therefore can have an altitude advantage over you. In terms of bombers, notable targets include B-17s, B-24s and Lancasters: all these bombers are more than capable of defending themselves with their numerous turrets.

'''MEC usage guide'''

The overheating issues on the plane can be remedied with manual engine controls

* '''Prop pitch''' - Set to 90% and leave it there. Do not set it lower than 90% as it will result in noticeable performance loss. Unlike most German aircraft, the Ta-154 uses a constant speed propeller and there is no risk of overrevving the engine. 
* '''Radiator''' - Varies with map. On cold maps (Smolensk, snow-covered maps) 15% should be enough to keep WEP on permanently. On summer maps keep the radiator around 50%. On hot maps (Spain, Sicily) values above 80% might be required to sustain WEP for long periods of time.
* '''Supercharger''' - The optimal supercharger gear switch altitude is 3,500 m, although it can vary slightly depending on map and airspeed.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Exceptional armament (with decent ammunition count)
* Heavy armour and nose mounted 2 x 20 mm and 2 x 30 mm cannons are the perfect combo for head-on attacks
* Manoeuvrability is sufficient to keep up with other heavy fighters and heavier American single engine fighters
* Absurdly durable airframe and cockpit (Engines are often destroyed long before the wings or pilot are lost)
* Can operate on a single engine (enough to get back to the airfield)
* Decent climb rate
* Interceptor spawn, will gain altitude much faster than its opponents
* Exceptional speed in a straight line
* Low wing load gives the plane a good turn rate at higher speeds
* Exceptional roll rate
* Excellent bomber interceptor
* Fear factor: Many Allied pilots who would normally go head on will break off from a head-on engagement, allowing you to either extend and make another pass or shoot him down if they pulls up or rolls to dodge
* Excellent glide ratio owing to wooden construction and low wing loading

'''Cons:'''

* Flaps break off easily at speeds above 450 km/h (279 mph)
* Varying muzzle velocity of the Mk 108 and MG 151 cannons makes long range shooting difficult
* Turns horribly at low speeds
* Can fly on 1 engine but only around 300 km/h (186 mph)
* Landing gears are very sensitive and will break when landing at speeds above 240 km/h (150 mph)
* Prolonged WEP can lead to engine problems, using manual engine control is highly recommended with this aircraft
* A rather large target
* Weak suspension on landing gear, watch descent rate closely
* Tail likes to fall off during belly landings, belly land only as a last resort
* Easy to over G at high speeds due to wooden construction
* Sensitive engines, will overheat quickly if radiators are punctured
* Occasionally can be pilot sniped in a head-on or by gunners through the thin plate behind the nose
* Elevator compression becomes severe past 660 km/h (410 mph), requiring a lot of room to pull out of a steep, high speed dive to avoid crashing into the ground

[[File:Squadron of Ta-154.jpg|thumb|Squadron of Ta-154]]
The Ta-154 was a fast twin-engine German interceptor/night fighter created and developed by renowned aircraft designer Kurt Tank during World War 2. It was eventually cancelled as it was to complicated to build for war-torn Nazi Germany.

The origins of the Ta-154 dated back to the late 1930s when Kurt Tank and his engineers were working on a twin-engined medium bomber called the Ta-211. It was planned to be made out of plywood bonded with a special chemical called Tego film. Only the pressurized cockpit would be made out of metal. The aircraft was supposed to use the Jumo 211r engine (which was why the Ta-211 had the number 211) but was instead fitted with the more powerful Jumo 213 engine when Junkers could not produce the Jumo 211r in time. The aircraft's serial number was changed to 8-154 and it was given the name Moskito as a tribute to the RAF's Dh.98 Mosquito.

The Ta-154V1 prototype made its first flight on July 1st, 1943 with the Jumo 211F engine. A few days later, the V2 prototype with the Jumo 211N took off for the first time. In trials, the Ta-154 easily outperformed its rivals- Ju-388 and He-219. The Ta-154 reached at top speed of 700km/h or 440mph in testing. The V3 prototype was equipped with radar and a second seat for the radar operator and was consequently 75km/h slower than the other two prototypes with its heavy night fighting equipment. 

In early 1944, the Jumo 213 engines finally arrived and a production run of 150 plus Ta-154A-1 models were ordered. Several were produced before the factory making the Tego-film glue was destroyed. As a result, the Germans substituted the Tego-film glue with an inferior type of glue. This inferior type proved to be complete garbage as several Ta-154s created with it fell apart in flight. Similar problems also struck the He-162 Volksjäger.

In August of 1944, Kurt Tank finally ordered the end of production of what could have been an amazing fighter as the Germans needed to turn their attention to faster aircraft like the Do-335 and could not waste time or resources. With that, the few Ta-154s built were used in night fighters squadrons or in training units. Several Ta-154s out of the 50 or so built saw combat in World War 2 as night fighters until the war ended. With that, the Ta-154s were examined or scrapped. One was captured by American forces but its fate is unknown.

Even though the Ta-154 only had a minor impact in real life, you can take control of the mighty Ta-154 in War Thunder and wreak havoc on the bombers that escaped its wrath back in WW2.
