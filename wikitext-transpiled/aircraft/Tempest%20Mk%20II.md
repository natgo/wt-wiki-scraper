== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Tempest Mk II is the last propeller-driven aircraft in the Hawker line and is a fitting send-off. With its sleek airframe, extremely powerful Centaurus engine and heavy weight, it holds one of the highest top speeds of any traditional prop aircraft in the game and acceleration to match. However, it only keeps these advantages below 3,000 m, as above that the engine will asphyxiate and you will notice a drastic decrease in performance.

Boom & Zoom is this aircraft's forté, and is the main way you should fly it. It can easily abuse its brutal speed and acceleration combined with the amazing dive speed and powerful weaponry to blitz any aircraft that it sets its sights on. On the flip side, the heavy weight means it fares very poorly in manoeuvre fights as most propeller aircraft (and some jet-powered ones) will easily turn circles around it.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The main tactic for the Tempest II is high-speed combat. With a weight of over 5,000 kg, and a peak WEP power of 2,500 hp it can accelerate very fast in a dive. This means that less altitude is traded for the same gain in speed compared to other props.

The second main benefit from the extra weight is that the plane can hold the speed gained from a dive for a long time. Additionally, the plane has a very sleek airframe, which means that its top speed is one of the highest of any prop in the game. Considering this data, the plane should be flown in high-speed shallow manoeuvres.

Against jets, the tactics are reversed. Jets are faster and heavier, thus shallow angles should be avoided. Steep angle energy fighting and turn fighting should be applied.
Few exceptions against jets should be made. The Ho 229 will out turn the Tempest II, but upwards spirals at high speed are an effective way to burn away the 229's energy and they are easily trapped.

The second exception is the Meteor F Mk.3. This plane outperforms or is on par in every aspect except for, hilariously enough, top speed on the deck.

The third and last are the Yak-15/17. They turn better, but their diving speed is a lot lower than the Tempest II's.

'''''Versus the Tempest''''':

There's not much one can do while a Tempest II is diving on your aircraft, as it'll blitz you before you know it and will be gone just as fast. Most smart Tempest pilots stay around 2,500-3,500 m so they can keep their engine performance and have the ability to abuse their dive speed. If you are able to catch a Tempest mid-turn or if it's unaware of your presence, it becomes significantly easier to take down considering most aircraft at the tier can turn circles around it. Try to catch them in a manoeuvre trap and force them to bleed their speed for an easy kill.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

'''Cons:'''

* Poor performance at high altitudes
* Often gets matches with early rank 5 aircraft (early jets)
* Sub-par turning radius
* Difficult to aim at high speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The creation of this plane also came with an older counterpart, the Tempest Mk V. The Mk II has a different engine than the Mk V which is why they seem different. The Mk II's were used later in the war than the Mk V's.

The Hawker Tempest Mk.II was a single seat fighter powered by a single Bristol Centaurus radial engine. After the Hawker Typhoon had proved unsatisfactory in its originally intended role as an interceptor, Hawker continued their work on viable options for a replacement aircraft.

The Hawker Tornado project had been run with two separate engine options concurrently; after the Tornado was cancelled the idea of trialing two separate engines was applied to Hawker's new venture, then entitled the Typhoon II. After major design changes and with a perceived lack of confidence in the Typhoon name, the aircraft was designated the Tempest. The original prototypes were planned as the Tempest I with the Sabre IV engine and the Tempest V with the Sabre II. Shortly after this, two Tempest Mk.IIs were ordered with the 18 cylinder Bristol Centaurus engine, rated at 2520 hp. An order for 500 Tempest IIs was placed in October 1942, before the prototype had even first taken to the air. The first flight occurred in June 1943 before the Bristol Aeroplane Company began production, completing construction of its first example in October 1944, joining the two prototypes to continue trials. After delays in the Tempest II program the aircraft type was originally intended for use against the Japanese in the Far East but entered service just too late for the operations in the Second World War.

The first two Tempest II squadrons were No.54 and No.247 in autumn 1945. Only two squadrons of Tempest IIs operated from the UK mainland itself. With the war's end the demand for high numbers of Hawker's new fighter no longer remained and aircraft contracts were reduced significantly. Whilst 'Tiger Force' – the planned force for the Far East – had been cancelled, the RAF still opted to deploy 180 Tempest IIs to the Far East between 1946 and 1947. Four squadrons were stood up in British India and used in policing actions in the local area before the aircraft were handed over to the Royal Indian Air Force and the Royal Pakistan Air Force. The Tempest II was also used as part of the British Forces of Occupation in Germany until July 1949. Only 552 Tempest IIs were built, serving with the RAF, India and Pakistan.
