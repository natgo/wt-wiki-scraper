== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]] as a premium vehicle purchasable in-game with Golden Eagles {{ge}}, but was removed from in-game sale after the [[wt:en/news/7408-news-happy-birthday-war-thunder-en|9th Anniversary Sale]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Tempest has an excellent Napier Sabre 2 engine. It allows air speeds up to 727 km/h (393 knots). The aircraft has a descent manoeuvrability, and extending the flaps helps massively in turning. You can outmanoeuvre almost any American airplane, but dogfighting isn't recommended in this plane. It can withstand from 14 G to -7 G.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Tempest's weakest point is the engine. It is '''''very''''' big and gives away after 2-3 hits. The aircraft becomes vulnerable because speed is one of its biggest advantages. It has an armoured glass in the front (44.45 mm or 1.75 in), and armour on the back of the seat (16.9 mm or 0.66 in). Its worst opponent is the [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire series]]. It's best not to mess with them. If you entered a dogfight reduce airspeed, extend flaps and let them overshoot. The Tempest is also vulnerable to AAA fire. You should avoid flying over enemy bases and airfields. If impossible to avoid, get close to the ground and fly away. Other than that the aircraft is very durable. It can withstand a solid amount of damage with [[:Category:Aircraft machine guns|MGs]] and [[:Category:Aircraft cannons|cannons]] in the hull. To increase chances of surviving, you should always avoid decreasing airspeed under 200 km/h (107 knots).

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Hispano Mk.V (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.V cannons, wing-mounted (200 rpg = 800 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Tempest has great performance in altitudes up to 5,000 m (16,404 ft). It isn't recommended to hunt bombers. The aircraft is best at destroying less manoeuvrable planes like: [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190s]], [[F4U (Family)|F4U Corsairs]], [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109s]], ground attack planes and any bomber that comes near the ground. It excels at high speeds. However it isn't a classic boom-and-zoom aircraft because you shouldn't fly too high after attack. The guns reach maximum efficiency when firing in bursts. Try to avoid long bursts, a burst should not exceed 5-6 bullets. You should replace the climbing with flying away in a more or less straight line. Don't attack unless you can fly away at a high airspeed (at least 500 km/h or 269 knots).

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great airspeed
* Good manoeuvrability
* Four Hispano 20 mm cannons
* Excellent Silver Lion and Research Points boosters

'''Cons:'''

* Engine vulnerable to damage
* Plane is large, presenting a big target for enemies
* Cannot equip payloads
* Expensive to purchase
* Lacking the "150 octane fuel" modification compared to the original British Tempest Mk V, this reduces the engine power by a solid 620 horsepower (although the plane still gets impressive engine performance for its rank)

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
On October 15, 1944, a Hawker Tempest Mk V, EJ709, flown by F/O George Taylor Kinnel of the RNZAF, was flying an armed reconnaissance mission over Münster when he was hit by flak and crash-landed at Nieukerk. He survived the landing and was taken as a POW.<ref name="GoeringTempest">"Goering's Tempest." The Hawker Tempest Page. N.p., 06 Dec. 2014. Web. 06 Mar. 2019. [http://www.hawkertempest.se/index.php/contributions/stories/129-goering-s-tempest# Website]</ref>

The aircraft was salvaged by 2./Versuchsverband O.K.L. and moved to Finnow. There, it was repaired with parts from another Tempest that had been shot down near Hespe in December 1944. The repairs were finished on January 4, 1945. It was then brought to Rechlin for testing.<ref name="GoeringTempest" />
