== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Great air-to-air armament options which includes AIM-9L and SuperTemp
* Advanced radar
* Access to countermeasures
* 27mm cannon which can be used both got air and ground targets
* Decent climb rate

*

'''Cons:'''

* Cannot turn well when flying at high speeds
* No proper air-to-ground armament options
* Wings and other important modules are prone to shatter at high speeds

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Panavia Tornado was born out of a joint effort by Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom during the late cold war in the 1970s. The Tornado would be designed as a twin-engined, variable-swept wing aircraft with a two-person crew an internal gun and provisions for a wide array of armament which included guided/unguided bombs, mine launchers, rockets, air to air missiles and air to ground missiles. The aircraft was also armed with 2 German made 27 mm Mauser BK-27 revolver cannon which was able to make short work of pretty much any aircraft it had in its sights, with the right munition it was also capable of taking out lightly armoured vehicles such as the BMP-1. The Panavia Tornado was primarily made to undertake missions which included tactical strike, reconnaissance, air defence and maritime patrol. What they aimed when making the design was an aircraft which could be very multi-role, it would allow the Panavia Tornado to replace several different types of aircraft which were at the time in service with the respected countries. The main variants which were designed included the IDS which was mainly a strike-fighter, the ADV which was the Air Defence Variant and lastly the ECR, which was mainly created to carry out recon and SEAD missions. In terms speed the Tornado could go up to 2,400 km per hour, its engine being known as the Turbo-Union RB199-34R Mk.103. After several proposals and design changes, the first prototype of the Panavia Tornado would fly on the 14th of August, 1974. The prototype would further solidify the partnership as when it was being demonstrated, a lot of positive comments would be made. Thus development would continue smoothly with the first aircraft being officially delivered to the RAF (Royal Air Force) and the German Air Force on 5 and 6 June 1979 respectively. 

In terms of the Italian ADV, during the late stages of the cold war Italy realised they needed more in the air defence department, the F104s although good as interceptors were not very suitable for dogfighting. Italy looked towards Britain for help. Thus on the 17th of November 1993, Italy would sign an agreement with the RAF to lease up 24 Tornado ADVs directly from the RAF stocks for a period of ten years. The first Italian pilots would be trained on the Tornado ADV platform at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, England starting in 1995. The Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare Italiana) would then receive its first Tornado ADV aircraft in the mid 1990s. These aircraft were assigned to specialized interceptor squadrons to protect Italian airspace and provide air defense for critical assets and regions. The Tornado ADV variant was specifically developed to serve as an interceptor to replace the aging fleets of existing fighter aircraft, The ADV variant featured longer-range radar, more powerful engines, and enhanced avionics to excel in the air defense role. Italy would not lease these aircraft again, due to issues which were found during its service. These issues included the lack of spare parts and lack of surplus engines. Italy would return most of the aircraft back to Britain, some of them remained in Italy and exposed in museums, such as the famous Vigna di Valle. Ultimately Italy would lease F-16 ADFs up until the Eurofighters were ready to take over.
