== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In 1996, it was more than apparent that the Tornado F.3 was severely outdated by contemporary fighter-interceptor standards, especially when compared to aircraft of the time like the F-22 and Su-27M (later redesignated as the Su-35). As a result, to fulfil the original plan for the Tornado F.3 to serve in the RAF until at least 2010, the Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP) was announced to upgrade the Tornado F.3 fleet with contemporary electronics, weapons, and various other improvements. These included radar and FCS upgrades to allow the Tornado F.3 to fire the new AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9M missiles, to replace its aging Skyflash and AIM-9L selection. However, due to poor management of previous FCS and radar upgrades to the RAF fleet, a situation described as "fleets within the fleet" occurred where the lack of standardization in Foxhunter radar modifications and upgrades in the Tornado fleet directly resulted in the failure to properly integrate most of the CSP upgrades. As a result, the Foxhunter radar was not compatible with the AIM-120 AMRAAM's mid-course correction feature through datalinked inertial guidance. These problems would be finally ironed out after 2003 during the AMRAAM Optimisation Programme, or AOP, which standardised the Foxhunter upgrades to allow for AIM-120 datalink guidance for multiple targets.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a British jet fighter-interceptor introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]] to the top ranks of the tree. It builds on the basis of the previous [[Tornado F.3]] in the tech tree by expanding the avionics suite and its missile selection. By having access to a more advanced radar, and the powerful AIM-120 active-radar homing missile, the Tornado F.3 Late is capable of dispatching enemies at a much safer distance than possible before with the Skyflash. And if you find yourself dangerously close to an enemy, then a radar-slaved AIM-9M will almost always make short work of them if they are manoeuvring around your frontal hemisphere. All in all, the F.3 Late serves as a direct upgrade in offensive capability over the previous Tornado F.3, giving British aircraft players access to new and advanced weaponry on an already familiar platform.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Chaff/flare pods allow the plane to carry 352 countermeasures, 32 of which are large calibre
* Access to AIM-120B and AIM-9M missiles
* Strong engines and light weight make for high acceleration
* Features an advanced RWR with tracking and launch detection
* 4 datalink channels allow the plane to guide all of its AMRAAMs at once

'''Cons:'''

* Engines are very fuel thirsty
* Cannot equip any ground attack ordnance at all
* Very low turn rate: avoiding missiles at close range, even with countermeasures, is a challenge
* BK27 cannon has a relatively low fire rate compared to other top tier cannons

== History ==
The Tornado F3, a crucial part of the RAF's air defense, underwent significant changes throughout its service, facing structural challenges and essential upgrades. Following the Gulf War, the Tornado F3 experienced accelerated fatigue due to intense combat conditions, which exceeded its initial design expectations. As a result, the airframes began wearing out faster than anticipated. Initially, BAe Systems was contracted to upgrade 15 airframes, but the subsequent batch was awarded to Airwork Services, which performed the upgrades at St Athan.

Soon after, the first four upgraded Tornado F3s (ZE292, ZE295, ZE343, and ZE728) exhibited structural problems. Pilots reported abnormal behavior, leading to the discovery of significant damage. Further inspections revealed 12 additional damaged airframes. Though scrapping these aircraft was initially considered, an innovative solution emerged: using the center sections of F2 airframes in storage at St Athan. This successful modification, starting with ZE154 and F2 ZD901, allowed the damaged F3s to return to service.

On March 24, 1993, a significant milestone was reached when the RAF accepted ZH559, the last Tornado built for the RAF, which remained in service until 2008. The next major upgrade involved fitting the F3 with AMRAAM and ASRAAM missiles under the Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP) awarded to BAe in 1997. This £125 million program upgraded the missile management system and main computer, providing the F3 with fire-and-forget capability and enhancing its combat effectiveness. Additional upgrades included towed radar decoys and trials with ALARM missiles on 11 Squadron aircraft.
