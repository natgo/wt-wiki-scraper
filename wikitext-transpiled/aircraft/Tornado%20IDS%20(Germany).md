== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the acquisition of the Tornado IDS by the Luftwaffe, the Deutschemarine (German Navy) also received 112 Tornado IDS aircraft for the anti-shipping and maritime patrol/reconnaissance roles. The naval Tornados, designated ''"Marineflieger"'', were easily recognizable due to the sea-gray liveries they usually used, and were outfitted with special weapon systems not found on the Luftwaffe Tornados, allowing them to use the [[AS.34 Kormoran]] anti-ship missile and BL775 cluster munitions. At the end of the Cold War, per the CFE Treaty, half of the Marinefliegers would be removed from naval service and instead incorporated into the Luftwaffe, to replace a wing of reconnaissance RF-4 Phantoms. The remaining Marinefliegers would continue their anti-shipping and maritime roles until 2005, when their units were disbanded and the Tornados were dispersed back into the Luftwaffe and upgraded into the [[Tornado IDS ASSTA1 (Germany)|ASSTA]] standard.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced during [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8021-event-winter-quest-en|2022 Winter Quest]] event. Being a older Tornado IDS variant, it lacks the [[Tornado IDS ASSTA1 (Germany)|ASSTA1]] upgrade found on its tech tree counterpart, meaning it can not use guided bombs and advanced targeting pods. However, being the Marineflieger (Naval variant), it gets access to the active radar [[AS.34 Kormoran]] anti-ship missiles, a very unique and niche weapon system. The Tornado is not great at air-to-air combat, and as this variant lacks its laser-guided bombs, it's also somewhat underwhelming in mixed battles against tanks. The IDS Marineflieger serves best as a collector's vehicle, due to its rare gift/event vehicle status, unique camouflages, and special weaponry. The aircraft does find a niche use on certain maps in Air [[Simulator Battles]], where its anti-ship missiles can be used against AI controlled naval targets.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This Tornado sits at a lower BR than the other Tornados. In secluded 1-vs-1, energy trapping an opponent is a viable option. However, one needs to be aware of their surroundings so as not to be third-partied while at a lower speed.

It is advisable to bomb enemy bases, since the Tornado is not very good in air combat. Since you will almost always be ahead of your team, it is advisable to throw flares when you are going to bomb a base. Once the bases are bombed there are two options:

# Return to base, resupply and continue bombing
# Try to support allies in air combat with missiles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Good acceleration and excellent top speed
* Mauser BK27 guns have decent hitting power and ammunition capacity
* Impressive bombload and access to AS.34 Kormoran anti-ship missiles
* Access to two AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missiles stock
* slow speed helps with turning when you have manual control of sweep wing

'''Cons:'''

* Bad manoeuvrability, makes air-to-air combat challenging
* No access to guided bombs
* AS.34 Kormoran missiles are rather unreliable weapon, even against the ships
* Negative G manoeuvres can rip your wings off

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== Concept ===

In 1967, the countries of Great Britain, Belgium, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, and West Germany decided to jointly develop a multirole fighter aircraft to replace the F-104 Starfighter. In 1968, the Netherlands, Canada, and Belgium left the project and the remaining nations signed an initial agreement. The definition phase began in 1969, requirements were placed on the new aircraft. The aircraft should be able to perform conventional and nuclear attacks, as well as aerial reconnaissance and naval warfare. To perform these tasks, the aircraft should have high survivability and be able to fly at extreme low altitudes, with high weapon accuracy in all weather conditions.

=== Development ===

In 1969, Rolls-Royce was chosen as the manufacturer of the new twin-jet engine.

Britain prevailed over Germany on the crew: Germany demanded one seat, as they did in the Starfighter. Ultimately, however, the decision was made to have two seats.

Production was split between nations, with being Britain responsible for the cockpit and tail, as well as the vertical stabilizer.

Germany made the center fuselage and air intakes, and Italy made the wings. Final assembly took place from 1973 on the three lines in Warton (Great Britain), Manching (Germany), and Turin (Italy). In 1976, the aircraft, previously known as the MRCA, was given the name Tornado. The first flight took place on August 14, 1974 in Manching (Germany). A total of 10 prototypes and six pre-production aircraft were built, of which the prototype P08 sadly crashed in 1979.

=== Service ===

The equipment of the task forces in Great Britain and Germany began in 1982, followed in 1984 by Italy, and in 1986 the only export customer, Saudi Arabia.

From 1990 to 1991, the German Electronic Combat and Reconnaissance variants (ECR) were produced. In 1995, 339 Tornado combat aircraft were in service with the German Armed Forces (Air Force and German Navy). The device unit price (aircraft costs) was estimated at that time at 55 million DM. In 1999, the last newly built Tornado was delivered to the Saudi Arabian Air Force. A total of 977 aircraft were manufactured.

Germany received 359 tornadoes from 1980 to 1991.

The Bundeswehr Navy used the variants IDS, Recce, and ECR.
