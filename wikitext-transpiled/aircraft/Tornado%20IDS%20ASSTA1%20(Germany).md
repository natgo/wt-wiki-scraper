== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the late '90s, while Britain was undergoing its modernization of the Tornado fleet, Germany also began plans to upgrade their older [[Tornado IDS (Germany)|Tornado IDS]] aircraft. The resulting upgrade package, named "ASSTA1" (Avionics System Software; Tornado in ADA) was finalized in 2000, to upgrade the German Tornado fleet for service in the 21st century. ASSTA1 incorporated a complete overhaul of most of the avionics suite, including an entirely new fire control system and weapons computer, GPS and Laser INS navigation suites, and the latest 1760 data bus, giving the Tornado full compatibility with the latest standardized NATO ordnance and their required targeting systems. As a result, in addition to its older loadouts, the ASSTA1 could carry the latest standard NATO guided ordnance, such as the AGM-88 HARM, in addition to the LITENING targeting pod and a plethora of Paveway III laser bomb options. Over the next years, German Tornados would also undergo the ASSTA2 and ASSTA3 upgrades, further enhancing their capabilities.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]], is a two-seat, twin-engine, swing-wing, multi-role combat aircraft built jointly by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. This version is the Tornado Interdiction/Strike or IDS for short, and as such, is almost completely useless in air-to-air combat against fighters of its battle rating. Instead, the Tornado IDS is best used in mixed battles, where its powerful ordnance and strong avionics allow it to rain hell on enemy aircraft from above. All in all, the ASSTA1 provides great CAS capability for mixed battles to the high ranking players of the German tree.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Tornado has no armour to speak of and is relatively large, making it an easy target for enemy guns. Almost any hit to the center part of the Tornado will leave its speed crippled, while any hit to the wings and tail will most likely cripple flight performance, if not disabling the aircraft outright. Although it could in theory make its way back to base even with only one engine, any enemy attention during this timespan will most likely get you sent back to the hangar. It also has 2 pilots, which means that you can continue flying in the unlikely case that only 1 pilot is knocked out.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
There are multiple ways to use the Tornado in ARB, one tactic is to stick to the team and try and give support with your AIM-9Ls on your way to the enemy bases and/or ground targets. This gives you the advantage of team cover and a bit of safety, although you will undoubtedly be in the midst of battle once enemy interceptors and fighters reach your team. The other tactic would be to go full throttle directly to the enemy bases while keeping extremely low to the ground to decrease your chances of being spotted visually or by radar. While this leaves you mostly alone and isolated from the possible support of your team, you will be able to take a more direct route to your main target, meaning you'll be able to evade any slower or unsuspecting enemies. Taking an active role in air-to-air combat is not advised, as the Tornado's flight performance is not suited to it and you'll most likely be shot down very quickly. So keep in mind that although the Tornado is fast, its not very manoeuvrable at high speed so try to avoid faster enemies such as the [[F-16 (Family)|F-16]] or the [[F-14A Early|F-14]]. In the case of 1-to-1 confrontation the best option is to simply hope you are faster and run away, against capable fighters like the MiG-23, F-16, MiG-29, Viggen, F-14, and Mirage 2000 you don't stand a chance, unless the enemy pilot is extremely inexperienced. With countermeasures you are able to survive for longer if you can time their use and can dodge without losing too much of your speed. 

; Ground Battles 

This variant of the Tornado works best when performing high-speed precision strikes. Although the unguided 1000 lb bombs are more than sufficent for this role, the guided munitions combined with the thermal imaging pod can be used to compensate for the former's relative low explosive yield. In both cases, the FLIR pod automatically creates a drop point for the CCRP system, requiring no line of sight once the target is acquired and the plane is on approach, allowing it to stay at a treetop level, outside the reach of SPAAs. On top of this, the guided bombs glide towards their target and can be used against moving targets, at the expense of having to keep the target in the FLIR's field of view.

''' Countering the Pantsir-S1 '''

Probably the most effective deterrent in the game against air support, the [[Pantsir-S1]] still has a number of flaws, most notably a lack of LWR, that can be exploited in the following steps:

# Alertness: Your RWR system immediately indicates whether a Pantsir's radar is active in the area, however, most Pantsir players will turn off their radar and rely on their thermals and long range IRST systems to engage you without detection. Even if you see no radar signature, you should still '''assume that a Pantsir is present.'''
# Acquisition: Although with the help of the FLIR pod you can easily spot the Pantsir's massive signature, that often means that it can see you too. A single teammate with a scout UAV or other method of reconnaissance can provide its precise location.
# Approach: Do not approach the battlefield directly. Instead, use a wide turn to approach from the flanks, using the terrain as cover. Make sure that the Pantsir isn't in cover from your angle. In most cases it will have its sight turned towards your team's spawn, allowing you to avoid detection.
# Adjustment: Once at a medium range from the target, climb slightly until you have a line of sight on the target, and target it the FLIR pod. Note: a direct lock isn't required unless the target is moving, once stabilized, the target point remains in place even without a line of sight and the laser returns to it once it is back in its FOV.
# Attack: In case of dumb bombs, dive back to treetop level and maintain approach while holding the bomb release key, the CCRP will automatically drop them on the target. When using smart bombs, move the drop cursor near the target and drop the bomb, then roll slightly to either direction pull away to keep the laser on target.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Good acceleration and excellent top speed
** Higher bomb load and speed than SU-22
* Mauser BK27 guns have decent hitting power and ammunition capacity
* Laser-guided munitions give it a good ground attack capability
* Can work as a figther when necessary
** Variable wing sweep allows it to turn better when at low speeds, or during an emergency at high speed (at the risk of destroying itself) 
** Radar assisted gun makes intercepting incoming or leaving planes easier

'''Cons:'''

* Full Bomb loadout can severely limit its maximum speed to about Mach 1.05
* Unstable wings, plane can rip itself apart when bombing at maximum speed at low altitude or when doing negative G manoeuvres
* Bad manoeuvrability makes air-to-air combat challenging, low air-to-air missile amount to compensate unlike other attacker options
* Only has access to 2 x AIM-9L for air-to-air purposes
* No search radar for planning around enemies
* Tracking radar is limited to 5°x6° until the target is locked

In 1967, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Italy, and the Federal Republic of Germany joined together to form the F-104 Replacement Group to begin joint planning for a Multi-Role Aircraft 75 (MRA-75) as a successor to the Starfighter.

In the UK, there was a need for a successor to the Canberra at the same time. Initially, work was done here on a national development, the BAC TSR.2. After this project was discontinued in 1965, development of a joint swing-wing fighter began with France under the Anglo-French Variable Geometry (AFVG) program. In addition, British forces were looking at introducing the General Dynamics F-111. However, France withdrew from the AFVG project in June 1967, and about six months later the British gave up their option to buy the F-111.

Britain decided to participate in a joint project in 1967 after initial coordination discussions with the F-104 Replacement Group nations. In 1968, the participating countries signed an initial memorandum that aimed at a joint project called the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA). At this point, Canada and Belgium withdrew their intentions to participate, followed shortly thereafter by the Netherlands.

In 1969, the definition phase began. The concept of the swing-wing was retained because of its versatility. The goal of the remaining nations, Germany, Italy and Great Britain, was to build a multi-role combat aircraft that could be used for conventional as well as nuclear air attacks, aerial reconnaissance and naval warfare from the air. The Warsaw Pact was seen as an adversary with a strong air defense and, at the same time, the ability to take offensive action against NATO itself with a large force deployment. The emphasis of the resulting operational requirements was therefore on high assertiveness and robustness. To ensure this, the new aircraft was required, among other things, to be capable of extreme low-level flight and precise weapons employment in all weather conditions, day and night, and also to have highly effective self-protection equipment. In addition, it was to be capable of using runways damaged by enemy air attacks. The UK also defined a requirement for a long-range interceptor fighter.

To ensure adequate representation of the interests of the participating nations in this multinational project, their governments decided to establish a joint organization under the NATO umbrella, the NATO Multi-Role Combat Aircraft Development and Production Management Organization (NAMMO). A separate agency, NAMMA, was established as the executive body with personnel from the three nations. NAMMA's mission was expanded in 1987 to include in-service support (NATO Multi-Role Combat Aircraft Development, Production and In-Service Support Management Agency). The agency merged with NEFMA from the Eurofighter program in 1995 to form the NATO EF 2000 and Tornado Development, Production & Logistics Management Agency (NETMA).

The industrial groups involved in the program, British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) and Fiat Aviazione, merged to form the independent international Panavia Aircraft GmbH, based in Munich, which had overall responsibility during the production phase and was the sole point of contact for NAMMA.

In 1969, the invitation to tender was issued for the development of the engine. Here, the British company Rolls-Royce came out on top with the Turbo-Union RB199 engine against the American manufacturers Pratt & Whitney and General Electric, partly because of the high degree of technology transfer offered to the other participating nations. The Turbo-Union Ltd. consortium, based in Great Britain and involving Rolls-Royce, Motoren- und Turbinen-Union (MTU) and Fiat, was set up to manufacture the engine.

Development began on July 20, 1970, after the United Kingdom had prevailed with the concept of the two-seat twin-engine aircraft; based on experience with the F-104 and the Fiat G.91 and for cost reasons, Germany had originally called for only one pilot and only one engine. The envisaged number of aircraft declined from 1,500 (GB: 300, D: 550, I: 200, others: 600) in 1968, including the British fighter version, to 809 (GB: 385, D: 324, I: 100) in 1972. Overall, delivery figures over the entire production and service period totaled: GB: 402, D: 357, I: 100. Production of the assemblies proceeded according to a division of labor. The cockpit and tail sections as well as the vertical stabilizer were manufactured by BAC (later BAE Systems), MBB (later DASA and EADS) produced the center fuselage section and the air intakes, and Fiat (later Aeritalia and Alenia Aeronautica) produced the wings with the high-lift aids. Final assembly took place from 1973 at three sites in Warton (Lancashire, UK), Manching (Germany) and Turin (Italy).

The maiden flight took place in Manching, Germany on August 14, 1974, and in 1976 the aircraft, until then designated MRCA, was given the name Tornado.

Series production began in 1979. In 1980, the first Tornado was delivered to the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment (TTTE) at Cottesmore for flying crew training. Equipment for operational units in the United Kingdom and Germany began in 1982, followed by Italy in 1984 and Saudi Arabia, the sole export customer, in 1986.

In late 1989, the U.S. Department of Defense investigated whether the Tornado could be used by U.S. air forces in the Wild Weasel role to replace the Phantom F-4G. However, this consideration was discarded in the early 1990s in favor of the existing F-16s.

From 1990 to 1991, the German Electronic Combat and Reconnaissance (ECR) variants were produced, which would later play an important role in the Balkan War. In 1991, the South Korean Air Force expressed interest in purchasing 50 Tornado ECRs. Due to delays caused by technical problems, the number was initially reduced to 24, and eventually the intention was abandoned.

In 1995, 339 Tornado fighter aircraft were in service with the Bundeswehr (Air Force and German Navy). Production of the Tornados then ended in 1998, after a total of 992 had been produced.
