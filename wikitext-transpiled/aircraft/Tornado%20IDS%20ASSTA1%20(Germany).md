== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]]. The Panavia 200 (PA-200) Tornado is a two-seat, twin-engine, swing-wing, multi-role combat aircraft built jointly by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. This version is the Tornado Interdiction/Strike or IDS, and was intended as a low-flying fighter bomber armed with precision weapons.

Its first combat missions were in the second Gulf War by the British, Italian and Saudi Arabian air forces. This was later followed by missions in the Yugoslavian and Kosovo wars, in which the Bundeswehr also participated for the first time. German Tornados also flew reconnaissance missions as part of the ISAF mission and in northern Iraq.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Tornado has no armour to speak of and is relatively large, making it an easy target for enemy guns. Almost any hit to the center part of the Tornado will leave its speed crippled, while any hit to the wings and tail will most likely cripple flight performance, if not disabling the aircraft outright. Although it could in theory make its way back to base even with only one engine, any enemy attention during this timespan will most likely get you sent back to the hangar. It also has 2 pilots, which means that you can continue flying in the unlikely case that only 1 pilot is knocked out.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
There are multiple ways to use the Tornado in ARB, one tactic is to stick to the team and try and give support with your AIM-9Ls on your way to the enemy bases and/or ground targets. This gives you the advantage of team cover and a bit of safety, although you will undoubtedly be in the midst of battle once enemy interceptors and fighters reach your team. The other tactic would be to go full throttle directly to the enemy bases while keeping extremely low to the ground to decrease your chances of being spotted visually or by radar. While this leaves you mostly alone and isolated from the possible support of your team, you will be able to take a more direct route to your main target, meaning you'll be able to evade any slower or unsuspecting enemies. Taking an active role in air-to-air combat is not advised, as the Tornado's flight performance is not suited to it and you'll most likely be shot down very quickly. In the case of 1-to-1 confrontation the best option is to simply hope you are faster and run away, against capable fighters like the MiG-23, F-16, MiG-29, Viggen, F-14, and Mirage 2000 you don't stand a chance, unless the enemy pilot is extremely inexperienced.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* High acceleration
* Laser-guided munitions give it a good ground attack capability

'''Cons:'''

* Bombs severely limit its maximum speed to about Mach 1.05
* Very sluggish and slow turning rate, is unable to effectively manoeuvre
* Only has access to 2 x AIM-9L for air-to-air purposes
* No search radar
* Tracking radar is limited to 5°x6° and has 2 km effective range

In 1967, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Italy, and the Federal Republic of Germany joined together to form the F-104 Replacement Group to begin joint planning for a Multi-Role Aircraft 75 (MRA-75) as a successor to the Starfighter.

In the UK, there was a need for a successor to the Canberra at the same time. Initially, work was done here on a national development, the BAC TSR.2. After this project was discontinued in 1965, development of a joint swing-wing fighter began with France under the Anglo-French Variable Geometry (AFVG) program. In addition, British forces were looking at introducing the General Dynamics F-111. However, France withdrew from the AFVG project in June 1967, and about six months later the British gave up their option to buy the F-111.

Britain decided to participate in a joint project in 1967 after initial coordination discussions with the F-104 Replacement Group nations. In 1968, the participating countries signed an initial memorandum that aimed at a joint project called the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA). At this point, Canada and Belgium withdrew their intentions to participate, followed shortly thereafter by the Netherlands.

In 1969, the definition phase began. The concept of the swing-wing was retained because of its versatility. The goal of the remaining nations, Germany, Italy and Great Britain, was to build a multi-role combat aircraft that could be used for conventional as well as nuclear air attacks, aerial reconnaissance and naval warfare from the air. The Warsaw Pact was seen as an adversary with a strong air defense and, at the same time, the ability to take offensive action against NATO itself with a large force deployment. The emphasis of the resulting operational requirements was therefore on high assertiveness and robustness. To ensure this, the new aircraft was required, among other things, to be capable of extreme low-level flight and precise weapons employment in all weather conditions, day and night, and also to have highly effective self-protection equipment. In addition, it was to be capable of using runways damaged by enemy air attacks. The UK also defined a requirement for a long-range interceptor fighter.

To ensure adequate representation of the interests of the participating nations in this multinational project, their governments decided to establish a joint organization under the NATO umbrella, the NATO Multi-Role Combat Aircraft Development and Production Management Organization (NAMMO). A separate agency, NAMMA, was established as the executive body with personnel from the three nations. NAMMA's mission was expanded in 1987 to include in-service support (NATO Multi-Role Combat Aircraft Development, Production and In-Service Support Management Agency). The agency merged with NEFMA from the Eurofighter program in 1995 to form the NATO EF 2000 and Tornado Development, Production & Logistics Management Agency (NETMA).

The industrial groups involved in the program, British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) and Fiat Aviazione, merged to form the independent international Panavia Aircraft GmbH, based in Munich, which had overall responsibility during the production phase and was the sole point of contact for NAMMA.

In 1969, the invitation to tender was issued for the development of the engine. Here, the British company Rolls-Royce came out on top with the Turbo-Union RB199 engine against the American manufacturers Pratt & Whitney and General Electric, partly because of the high degree of technology transfer offered to the other participating nations. The Turbo-Union Ltd. consortium, based in Great Britain and involving Rolls-Royce, Motoren- und Turbinen-Union (MTU) and Fiat, was set up to manufacture the engine.

Development began on July 20, 1970, after the United Kingdom had prevailed with the concept of the two-seat twin-engine aircraft; based on experience with the F-104 and the Fiat G.91 and for cost reasons, Germany had originally called for only one pilot and only one engine. The envisaged number of aircraft declined from 1,500 (GB: 300, D: 550, I: 200, others: 600) in 1968, including the British fighter version, to 809 (GB: 385, D: 324, I: 100) in 1972. Overall, delivery figures over the entire production and service period totaled: GB: 402, D: 357, I: 100. Production of the assemblies proceeded according to a division of labor. The cockpit and tail sections as well as the vertical stabilizer were manufactured by BAC (later BAE Systems), MBB (later DASA and EADS) produced the center fuselage section and the air intakes, and Fiat (later Aeritalia and Alenia Aeronautica) produced the wings with the high-lift aids. Final assembly took place from 1973 at three sites in Warton (Lancashire, UK), Manching (Germany) and Turin (Italy).

The maiden flight took place in Manching, Germany on August 14, 1974, and in 1976 the aircraft, until then designated MRCA, was given the name Tornado.

Series production began in 1979. In 1980, the first Tornado was delivered to the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment (TTTE) at Cottesmore for flying crew training. Equipment for operational units in the United Kingdom and Germany began in 1982, followed by Italy in 1984 and Saudi Arabia, the sole export customer, in 1986.

In late 1989, the U.S. Department of Defense investigated whether the Tornado could be used by U.S. air forces in the Wild Weasel role to replace the Phantom F-4G. However, this consideration was discarded in the early 1990s in favor of the existing F-16s.

From 1990 to 1991, the German Electronic Combat and Reconnaissance (ECR) variants were produced, which would later play an important role in the Balkan War. In 1991, the South Korean Air Force expressed interest in purchasing 50 Tornado ECRs. Due to delays caused by technical problems, the number was initially reduced to 24, and eventually the intention was abandoned.

In 1995, 339 Tornado fighter aircraft were in service with the Bundeswehr (Air Force and German Navy). Production of the Tornados then ended in 1998, after a total of 992 had been produced.
