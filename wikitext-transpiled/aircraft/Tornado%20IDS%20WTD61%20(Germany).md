== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
'''Wehrtechnische Dienststelle 61''', or the ''Bundeswehr Technical Center for Aircraft and Aeronautical Equipment and Airworthiness Center for Aircraft'', is a special testing center for the task of testing and evaluating of military aircraft and aerial weapon systems. One of the many aircraft they operate include a small selection of Tornado IDS aircraft, for future weapon systems on the Tornado airframe. WTD 61 was responsible for testing the integration of the upgraded avionics and ordnance later fitted on German Tornado IDS aircraft through the [[Tornado IDS ASSTA1 (Germany)|ASSTA standard]], while also tinkering with and testing various other experimental systems, including the more famous laser-guided Sidewinder missile.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium pack top tier German strike aircraft introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]]. It is almost identical to the event [[Tornado IDS MFG (Germany)|Tornado IDS Marineflieger]], with the only difference being the lack of [[AS.34 Kormoran]] anti-ship missiles. As such, it is almost completely identical in gameplay as well, being outclassed by most aircraft it faces in dedicated air battles, and also having somewhat underwhelming CAS capability at its battle rating in mixed battles due to the lack of guided ordnance. All in all, the Tornado IDS WTD 61 serves best in the role of a frontline bomber-interdictor for grinding silver lions and research points, due to its respectable top speed and bomb load plus its premium bonuses. One must always avoid direct engagement against enemy aircraft when flying the Tornado IDS, as its small air-to-air loadout of two AIM-9Ls is further reduced in effectiveness due to the poor handling and heavy weight of the Tornado family of aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Variable wing sweep aircraft - can be used as a fighter after bombing, if required
* Has radar gun assist with its tracking radar
* Favorable matchmaking area where it will not frequently see most of the next-generation fighters, which means less uptiers, where the Tornado will have a hard time to be competitive
* Grants more RP and SL per action due to premium status

'''Cons:'''

* Requires special procedures and speed control to work well as a fighter
* Full bombing loadout will severely limit its maximum speed to 1.05 MACH
* Most basic loadout of all Tornado bombers - only dumb bombs
** Has anti-ship search radar, but no special equipment to capitalize on it 
* Radar gun assist has shorter range than other Tornado planes by 300 m (at 1.2km) which is getting way too close for comfort in head-on fights
* Cannons deal low damage to planes unless the target was set on fire
