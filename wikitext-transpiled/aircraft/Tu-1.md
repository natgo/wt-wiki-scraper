== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
While working on the [[Tu-2]] bomber, Tupolev was inspired to design a multipurpose aircraft capable of intercepting, bomber escort, and ground attack. First, a Tu-2 was modified to fit this task, and the military was interested enough to authorize the development of the new aircraft as a heavy fighter. Even when the war broke, the development continued, although this was slowed due to the Tu-2 becoming a priority. The aircraft was specially designed for interception and ground attack, featuring a radar in the nose, two 45 mm NS-45 guns installed in the front of the bomb bay, and two 23 mm NS-23 guns in the wings. With a crew of three, one pilot and two defensive gunners, the entire back of the aircraft was covered, both above and below the fuselage. While the tests in 1947 for the aircraft were successful, jet-powered aircraft started to be more and more common, and thus the project was scrapped.

It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]]. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' features a good number of advantages for the ground attack role. It has a very powerful armament and a good top speed; the four cannons are more than enough to deal with both ground and air targets, although the 45 mm cannons don't have the accuracy or rate of fire to be effective in air combat. To deal with ground targets, the set of three 1,000 lb bombs are excellent to deal with large quantities of enemies. One of these bombs is usually enough to destroy all targets in a capture point. For naval battles, the Tu-1 is also able to two 450 mm torpedoes that, while not the strongest, are capable enough to destroy light cruisers and destroyers. It should be noted that as a heavy fighter the acceleration is mediocre, and you should avoid dogfights as much as possible.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Tupolev Tu-1 has a high top speed. However, its acceleration is noticeably slow as it is a heavy aircraft and it is degraded even further by the drag of bombs carried externally.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

;Armour plates

* 65 mm armoured glass in front of and behind the pilot
* 12 mm steel on the pilot's seat
* 10 mm of steel behind the radar
* 65 mm armoured glass behind the radar
* 5 mm steel beneath the rear gunner
* 12 mm of steel in front of the dorsal gunner
* 12 mm of steel in front of the ventral gunner

All this armour and a good defensive armament makes for a pretty survivable aircraft. This plane also gets self-sealing fuel tanks, which helps limiting fire damage.

=== Offensive armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|NS-45 (45 mm)|NS-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 45 mm NS-45 cannons, chin-mounted (50 rpg = 100 total)
* 2 x 23 mm NS-23 cannons, wing-mounted (130 rpg = 260 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FAB-250M-44 (250 kg)|FAB-500M-44 (500 kg)|FAB-1000M-44 (1,000 kg)|45-36NU (450 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 6 x 250 kg FAB-250M-44 bombs (1,500 kg total)
* 3 x 500 kg FAB-500M-44 bombs (1,500 kg total)
* 3 x 1,000 kg FAB-1000M-44 bombs (3,000 kg total)
* 2 x 450 mm 45-36NU torpedoes

=== Defensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}
<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:

* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, dorsal turret (250 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, ventral turret (350 rpg)

The defensive guns have limited coverage, so if an enemy aircraft comes from above, you will have a hard time defending yourself.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In RB, the aircraft is given a strike fighter spawn, meaning it does not have as much room to dive and gain speed as a bomber. The Tu-1 is capable of destroying enemy fighters in head-on engagements or unsuspecting attackers, thanks to its 23 mm and 45 mm cannons. For usage in combined forces, the Tu-1 makes for a very potent attacker, carrying three 1,000 kg bombs as well as the pair of 45 mm cannons having the option to fire API-T rounds, which can knock out all but the heaviest tanks at its BR from the tops and sides.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 2 powerful 45 mm cannons
* Great payload options with up to 3 tons of bombs
* 2 torpedoes in naval battles can sink battleships
* Has access to a target detection radar

'''Cons:'''

* Targeting radar is next to useless outside of simulator battles
* Weak against enemies from above
* Heavy weight

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

=== [[wt:en/news/7329-development-tu-1-the-tzar-of-heavy-gunners-en|Devblog]] ===
Back in the pre-war period, while working on the Tu-2 front-line bomber, the Tupolev design team had the idea of ​​creating a multipurpose aircraft on its basis that could perform a wider range of tasks, including escorting bombers at high altitudes and intercepting enemy aircraft. The first tests of the Tu-2 convinced the military authorities to initiate development for the role of a heavy fighter. However, the outbreak of the war forced the designers to focus on the modifications of the Tu-2 bomber series. Nonetheless, work on the version of the heavy fighter did not stop, moreover, one of the key components of the new aircraft was to become a radar, which would allow the location of targets at distances of up to 8 km and at any time of the day. Andrey Tupolev personally attended lectures on aviation radars, after which he enthusiastically started adapting the latest developments on his aircraft. In the meantime, work continued on enhancing the combat and flight characteristics of the aircraft. The armament was significantly improved compared to the original concepts - two 45-mm NS-45 guns were installed in the front of the bomb bay, supported by 2x 23-mm guns in the wings. The defensive armament of the aircraft was represented by two 12.7mm UBT machine guns. After experiments with the power-plant, the choice fell on the M-43V engines with a four-blade propeller. The finished prototype made her maiden flight only in the spring of 1947. Despite the good test results, the project of the Tupolev heavy fighter was not continued. The era of jet aircraft was approaching.
