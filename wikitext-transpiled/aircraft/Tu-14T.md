== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].

Designed for the same specifications as the IL-28, the Tu-14T is larger and has more loadout choices than its "cousin". Due to its larger size, it is slower, making it more vulnerable. Like the IL-28 it has a 23 mm turret, allowing it to shoot down interceptors sitting on its tail. Unique among all jet bombers, the Tu-14T can carry a torpedo, which along with its airbrake means it can more effectively target naval vessels.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB). -->
Much like the IL-28, the Tu-14T can be used in a variety of roles, from a fast base bomber to ground attacker. However, because it is more sluggish than the IL-28 and has less ammo for its offensive guns, it is far less effective at being an impromptu fighter. Because of its slower speed compared to the IL-28, the Tu-14T will be more easily intercepted, requiring the player to rely more on its 23 mm turret to knock out or deter enemy planes.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Fixed and turret guns of a large calibre
* Unlike most jet bombers, it has a defensive turret
** Good firing angles for the turret
** Turret has larger ammo capacity than the Il-28's
* Access to a torpedo
* Comparatively fast to contemporary jet bombers
* Comes with rocket boosters following a landing, these can be used to assist take-off or in the air for a burst of speed
* Access to airbrake
* Gunner and pilot both have armour protection

'''Cons:'''

* Limited ammunition for offensive armament
* No access to rockets
* Large silhouette
* Too large and heavy to dogfight
* Unable to outrun the majority of fighters in level flight
* Can struggle to gain altitude or airspeed
* Slower than its "cousins", the [[IL-28]] and the [[IL-28Sh]]
* Complicated MEC

The Tu-14 'Bosun' was a Soviet jet-powered torpedo bomber, built in small numbers in the early 1950s. Initially designed as a competitor to the Ilyushin [[IL-28]] 'Beagle', the Tu-14 failed to generate sufficient interest and was thereafter redesigned as a torpedo bomber. Due to the low priority of naval aircraft in the Soviet military command, only small numbers of Tu-14s were built. The Tu-14 served as the primary Soviet land-based torpedo bomber until 1961, and served secondary duties until 1970.<ref name=":0">Aguilera, R. (1997)</ref> Only 88 aircraft were built.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Tu-14.jpg|center|thumb|500x500px|Tu-14T aircraft in the 1950s.]]

=== Design and development ===
The Tu-14 was designed as a light bomber to compete against the IL-28. Initially designated the Tu-81, it was the culmination of several Tupolev bomber projects, including the Tu-72, -73, -74, -78 and -79. Originally designed as a trijet, it reverted to a twin-engine design after the improved Klimov RD-45/VK1 engine became available. The aircraft featured a conventional straight wing with the two engines slung on nacelles, with a large, spacious bomb bay located in the centre of the main fuselage. Armament consisted of a pair of forward-firing 23 mm cannons, with another pair located in the rear 'stinger' turret position, as well as 3,000 kg of bombs or torpedoes.<ref name=":1">Aviastar. (n.d.)</ref> The aircraft was piloted by a crew of three; a pilot, bombardier and tail gunner. The aircraft could reach a top speed of 845 km/h, and had a range of 3,010 km.<ref name=":0" />

The first Tu-14 prototype was completed in 1948 and was test-flown in 1949. It had a slightly greater range than the IL-28, but failed to generate sufficient interest within the higher ranks of the Russian Military Command. As a result, the Ilyushin aircraft was chosen to become the principal Soviet jet-powered light bomber, and the Tu-14 was instead ordered as a torpedo-bomber and maritime patrol aircraft.<ref name=":1" />

=== Operational History ===
The Tu-14 started entering service in 1951, as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft and torpedo-bomber. However, due to the lower priority of naval aircraft, only small numbers of Tu-14s were built. The Tu-14 was redesignated the Tu-14T in production models to signify its role as a torpedo bomber.<ref name=":0" /> A reconnaissance version of the aircraft was initially designed as well, with designation Tu-14R, but was never ordered.<ref name=":0" /> In total, 88 Tu-14 aircraft were produced for the Soviet Naval air force, replacing the Tu-2T torpedo bomber. The Tu-14 stayed in frontline service until 1961, and was subsequently relegated to secondary duties. It continued to serve in secondary duties until 1970.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
