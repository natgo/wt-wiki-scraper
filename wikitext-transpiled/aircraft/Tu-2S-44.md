== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Once spawned (~3,500 m), locate what ground targets to engage. It is suggested to engage the targets farthest from the enemy's airfield in order to avoid detection. Attack pillboxes (light or heavy, it doesn't matter with 500 kg bombs) as these don't move. Only engage the AI tanks if there are no pillboxes, and if engaging the tanks, judge the speed of the tank column, and release the bombs, making sure to lead where the tanks will be as the bombs fall, not where they are in that moment.

When bombing anything, note that the center of the reticle should be aimed below the target by about a centimetre (looking at the screen). This will allow the bombs maximum precision. Remember to open the bomb bay doors before attempting to drop the bombs. Once the payload has dropped, begin attacking artillery and AAA guns with the 20 mm cannons. Fire in short bursts to conserve ammo, as the more of these light targets are destroyed, the better. Never attack light pillboxes with the frontal cannons! The ammo spent attempting to destroy these (~200 rounds) isn't worth it! Always attack lighter targets, or if the situation presents itself, enemy aircraft. Once the bombs and cannon ammo are exhausted, then high-tail it back to the airfield. Fully upgraded, the Tu-2S can maintain ~450 km/h on the deck, no problem. Be careful upon landing, as the plane tends to stall at ~175 km/h. Rearm, and repeat!

'''Specific enemies worth noting'''

* [[Spitfire F Mk 24]], [[Fw 190 D-13]], [[F8F-1B]], etc. - Late War piston-fighters are constant opponents at the battle rating, so they should never be ignored. If possible, run back to base and don't commit to a head-on with props, as they have a little more time to aim their shots and steady their plane. Rely mostly on the defensive turrets if needed.

* [[Kugelblitz]], [[Crusader AA Mk II]], etc. - Player-controlled SPAAs are the bane of bombers (especially medium-sized ones such as the Tu-2S-44). When the tracers fly, don't risk a dive. Circle around or find some unsuspecting flanker that is outside the cover of these AAA guns.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast, for a medium bomber
* High wing rip speed (over 700 km/h)
* Air spawn in RB.
* Very easy to land and take-off
* Decent payload, 500 kg bombs are very useful in tank RB
* Forward-firing ShVAK cannons, can be useful in a head-on engagement
* Twin tail design leaves little restriction on back gunners
* Decently agile for its size
* Guaranteed to put out fires on fuel tanks due to pressurized gas system
* Very efficient in taking out individual ground targets
* Individual bomb drops, very effective in tank battles
* Engines can cool down even with a 100% throttle
* Can pretty much WEP indefinitely
* Great all-round visibility for a bomber/attacker, even has a downward window in the nose, allowing you to scan target area

'''Cons:'''

* Matchmaking pits the Tu-2S against jets and late/post war props
* Only two bombs when stock
* Can extinguish fires but sometimes it will just burn out before the fuel tanks seal in time
* Relatively small defensive armament
* Only one pilot and is not protected by armour from the front
* High stall speed (175 km/h, more of a pain when taking off/landing)
* Although it is fast, everything else is faster
* Performance starts to degrade with altitude
* Low amount of cannon ammo (150 rounds per gun)
* While gunsight is well above the cockpit, it is still obstructed by the sight itself, limiting downward visibility in a lead

Tupolev Tu-2S Front Line Bomber with M-82FN engines, main post-war series (NATO reporting name: Bat).

After World War II combat operations had ceased, production of the Tu-2S continued. During peace time, the military could afford to demand that those defects which they had had to put up with during the war be eliminated. The in-flight view of the pilot and the navigator was still considered unsatisfactory. Although the plane's fire power was considerable, the bomber's defense capability was reduced due to the small angle of fire for its turrets. The bomb release system was unreliable. These and other defects were progressively eliminated on the post-war Tu-2S from one production series to another.

Beginning with series 41, a new lower hatch, opening outward, was installed for the radio operator/gunner, and in series 42, the amount of protective armour on the back of the pilot's chair and on the hatches over the cannons in the wings was increased. A second landing headlight was added to all production planes. Beginning with series 44, the gunner's in-flight view was improved when three small round blisters on each side were replaced with one large one. Removal of the wooden structural parts from the airframe began; specifically, the tail cone was once again constructed of metal. The designers widened the pilot and the navigator's cockpit canopy and equipped it with convex side blisters. Extendable footrests were added, facilitating access to the pilot's and navigator's stations.

One important novelty was the replacement of the defensive weapons with models featuring an increased sighting angle. The BUSh-1 blister mount was replaced with the VUS-1, the LU-UBT hatch mount with the LU-68, and the VUB-2M upper defensive turret with the VUB-68.

Series 51 featured new main landing gear wheels with an increased carrying capacity but a smaller size. At the same time, a new tail wheel with a reinforced fork was implemented. The bay of the new tail skid had to be expanded so that the modified wheel could be retracted into the fuselage. A grooved strip was laid along the starboard wing of the plane so that the crew's footing would not slip on the wing's smooth metal surface. In addition, a new RSI-6 command radio set was installed in the pilot's cockpit.

Beginning in series 52, the designers abandoned the wooden wing tips, the last leftover from the wartime economy. Now every Tu-2S was produced with a completely metal airframe. More sophisticated equipment called for increased power from the aircraft's electrical system, so two more powerful GSK-1500 generators were installed.
