== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Once spawned (~3,500 m), locate ground targets to engage. It is suggested to engage the targets farthest from the enemy's airfield in order to avoid detection. Attack pillboxes (light or heavy, it doesn't matter with 500 kg bombs) as these don't move. Only engage the AI tanks if there are no pillboxes, and if engaging the tanks, judge the speed of the tank column, and release the bombs, making sure to lead where the tanks will be as the bombs fall, not where they are in that moment.

When bombing anything, note that the center of the reticle should be aimed below the target by about a centimetre (looking at the screen). This will allow the bombs maximum precision. When releasing the two bombs from the bomb bay, hold the flight pattern for about 1/2 a second longer than normal to compensate for the opening of the bomb bay doors. Once the payload has dropped, begin attacking artillery and AAA guns with the 20 mm cannons. Fire in short bursts to conserve ammo, as the more of these light targets are destroyed, the better. Never attack light pillboxes with the frontal cannons! The ammo spent attempting to destroy these (~200 rounds) isn't worth it! Always attack lighter targets, or if the situation presents itself, enemy aircraft. Once the bombs and cannon ammo are/is exhausted, then high-tail it back to the airfield. Fully upgraded, the Tu-2S-59 can maintain ~450 km/h on the deck, no problem. Be careful upon landing, as the plane tends to stall at ~175 km/h. Rearm, and repeat!

====Specific enemies worth noting====
<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->
The Tu-2S-59 has a battle rating of 5.7. Should the Tu-2S-59 be engaged, here are some suggestions per plane.

Do not engage a fighter on purpose, the following is only for defensive and survival reference.

[[Ho 229 V3|Horten 229]] - This plane is agile, fast, and dangerous, possessing a pair of Mk 103 cannons. When engaged with one of these planes, force a head-on pass if he is either below or on equal altitude as the Tu-2S-59. Once the pass has concluded, and if neither of the two are down, push the throttle to WEP and run. When the 229 turns to pursue, it ''will'' catch up. Use the defensive turrets at this point, as these are the Tu-2S-59's only hope for making it out alive. Aim for the pilot.

[[Me 262 A-1a|Me 262 A-1]] and [[Me 262 A-1/U4|A-1/U4 Pulkzerstorer]] - These planes are a tough opponent. They are fast and possess better armour than the 229, so the turrets are not going to be as effective in destroying these enemies. Again, if the enemy is below or on equal altitude as the Tu-2S-59, force a head on pass and run after it ends (if able). Use the turrets, but know that these planes are designed to be bomber-hunters, and are ruthlessly efficient in their task.

[[F-80A-5|F-80A]], [[F-80C-10|F-80C]] & [[F-84B-26]] - Although most matches with the Tu-2S-59 will be on the Berlin map, mixed battles and alternate history is always a possibility. For these planes, use the same tactics. Force a head on, and then run after. Use the turrets to attack them while withdrawing.

''Late War Props (Spitfire 24, Fw 190 D-13, F8F-1B, etc.)'' - These should never be ignored. If possible, run back to base and don't commit to a head on with props, as they have a little more time to aim their shots and steady their plane. Rely mostly on the defensive turrets if needed.

''Player-Controlled Flak (Kugelblitz, Crusader AA, etc.)''<br>
These are the bane of bombers (especially medium-sized ones such as the Tu-2S-59). When the tracers fly, don't risk a dive. Circle around or find some unsuspecting flanker that is outside the cover of these AAA guns.

====Counter-tactics====
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->
If confronted with an enemy Tu-2S-59, initiate a head on pass ''but then pitch up and stall their plane out.'' Additionally, maintain a safe altitude and utilize Boom & Zoom tactics, but it is worth noting that the Tu-2 is able to turn adequately.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast, for a medium bomber
* High wing rip speed (over 700 km/h)
* Air spawn in RB
* Very easy to land and take off
* Decent payload
* Forward-firing ShVAK cannons, can be useful in a head-on engagement
* Not as vulnerable as other 4-engine bombers
* Twin tail design leaves little restriction on back gunners
* Decently agile for its size
* Can often put out fires in fuel tanks due to pressurized gas system
* Individual bomb drops, very effective in tank battles
* Engines can cool down even with a 100% throttle
* Can pretty much WEP indefinitely
* Just need to research one modification for all payload options

'''Cons:'''

* Only two bombs when stock
* Relatively small defensive armament
* Only one pilot and is not protected by armour from the front
* High-ish stall speed (175 km/h, more of a pain when taking off/landing)
* Although it is fast, everything else is faster
* Performance starts to degrade with altitude
* Low amount of cannon ammo (150 rounds per gun)
