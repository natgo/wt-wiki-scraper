== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The start of the Tupolev-manufactured aircraft in the Soviet aviation tree, the Tu-2S delivers a mix of agile aircraft handling with the twin-engine and a sight-enabled payload for accurate delivery of bombs onto small targets.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Once spawned (~3,500 m), locate what ground targets to engage. It is suggested to engage the targets farthest from the enemy's airfield in order to avoid detection. Attack pillboxes (light or heavy, it doesn't matter with 500 kg bombs) as these don't move. Only engage the AI tanks if there are no pillboxes, and if engaging the tanks, judge the speed of the tank column, and release the bombs, making sure to lead where the tanks will be as the bombs fall, not where they are in that moment.

When bombing anything, note that the center of the reticule should be aimed below the target by about a centimetre (looking at the screen). This will allow the bombs maximum precision. Remember to open the bomb bay doors before attempting to drop the bombs. Once the payload has dropped, begin attacking artillery and AAA guns with the 20 mm cannons. Fire in short bursts to conserve ammo, as the more of these light targets are destroyed, the better. Never attack light pillboxes with the frontal cannons! The ammo spent attempting to destroy these (~200 rounds) isn't worth it! Always attack lighter targets, or if the situation presents itself, enemy aircraft. Once the bombs and cannon ammo are exhausted, then high-tail it back to the airfield. Fully upgraded, the Tu-2S can maintain ~450 km/h on the deck, no problem. Be careful upon landing, as the plane tends to stall at ~175 km/h. Rearm, and repeat!

'''Specific enemies worth noting'''

Late War piston fighters ([[Spitfire F Mk 24]], [[Fw 190 D-13]], [[F8F-1B]], etc.) - These are constant opponents at the battle rating, so they should never be ignored. If possible, run back to base and don't commit to a head-on with props, as they have a little more time to aim their shots and steady their plane. Rely mostly on the defensive turrets if needed.

Player-Controlled SPAAs ([[Kugelblitz]], [[Crusader AA Mk II]], etc.) - These are the bane of bombers (especially medium-sized ones such as the Tu-2S). When the tracers fly, don't risk a dive. Circle around or find some unsuspecting flanker that is outside the cover of these AA guns.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Fast, for a medium bomber
- High wing rip speed (over 700 km/h)
- Air spawn in RB
- Very easy to land and take off
- Decent payload, 500 kg bombs are very useful in tank RB
- Forward-firing ShVAK cannons, can be useful in a head-on engagement
- Twin tail design leaves little restriction on back gunners
- Decently agile for its size
- Guaranteed to put out fires on fuel tanks due to pressurized gas system
- Very efficient in taking out individual ground targets
- Individual bomb drops, very effective in tank battles
- Engines can cool down even with a 100% throttle
- Can pretty much WEP indefinitely
- Great all-round visibility for a bomber/attacker, even has a downward window in the nose, allowing you to scan target area

'''Cons:'''

- Only two bombs when stock
- Can extinguish fires but sometimes it will just burn out before the fuel tanks seal in time
- Relatively small defensive armament
- Only one pilot and is not protected by armour from the front
- High stall speed (175 km/h, more of a pain when taking off/landing)
- Although it is fast, everything else is faster
- Performance starts to degrade with altitude
- Low amount of cannon ammo (150 rounds per gun)
- While gunsight is well above the cockpit, it is still obstructed by the sight itself, limiting downward visibility in a lead

Tupolev Tu-2S Front Line Bomber with M-82FN engines, Moscow Aircraft Factory No. 23, series 1 to 43 (NATO reporting name: Bat).

After production of the Tu-2 was stopped, work on improving the aircraft nevertheless continued. It obtained a new version of the Shvetsov M-82FN engine, equipped with direct fuel injection, with an increased maximum engine power of 1,850 hp. The new engines improved the aircraft's flight characteristics. Also, the bomber's earlier defects were practically eliminated. In July 1943, the State Defense Committee decided to begin mass production of the Tu-2 with the M-82FN engines.

The so-called "standard" bombers, the Tu-2S ("S" meaning "standard"), were different from Aircraft 103VS. They were simple and cheap as far as production and operation went, with a minimum set of equipment.

The Tu-2S had the 103VS's braking vanes and their release mechanisms removed, but the dive recovery control was left intact. The stabilizer was fixed and the steering gear removed. The vertical empennage area was increased. Only the right rudder had a trim tab. The plane's fuel tanks were reduced in number, and the resulting loss in fuel capacity was somewhat compensated for by enlarging the remaining tanks.

The plane's defensive armament was similar to that of Aircraft 103VS, but the ammunition of the LU-UBT unit was increased to 350 rounds. The rocket beams and weapon controls were removed. But, unlike its predecessor, the Tu-2S was equipped with chemical weapons. It could carry UKhAP-500 aerial spray devices or ABK-P-500 clusters, which could be filled with bomblets or AZh-2 ampoules containing KS self-igniting fluid.

The first Tu-2S was built in September 1943. A total of 1,145 Tu-2S front-line bombers were produced from 1943-45.

By the end of 1942, the Tu-2 appeared on the Kalinin Front and then on the Southwestern Front. From 1944-45, the Tu-2S was used in the Baltics, Poland, and Germany, including the Battle of Berlin. In August 1945, units armed with the Tu-2S operated against Japan.

The Tu-2S is justly considered the best front-line bomber of the Red Army Air Force. It was superior to the famous Pe-2 in all its basic characteristics, especially in its defensive armament. During the war, the Tu-2S was only used by the Red Army Air Force.
