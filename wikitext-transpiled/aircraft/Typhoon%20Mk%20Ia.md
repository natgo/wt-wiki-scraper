== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Typhoon Mk Ia is a great fighter for the rank it is at. The first thing that a pilot will notice with the Typhoon Mk Ia is that it is insanely fast for its battle rating, so diving at a five to ten-degree angle, if the Typhoon is being attacked or if its attack failed, is a solid choice if the plane has the altitude. However, if playing in Arcade battles with this plane, the diving tactic may not work since the Arcade battle maps are quite small.

Despite its thick wings, the Typhoon is surprisingly good at turning. It can reliably out-turn Fw 190s and other boom and zoom oriented fighters.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 3 mm Steel - Armoured engine plate
- 1 mm Steel - Fore cockpit plate
- 12.7 mm Steel - Armour plate behind pilot's seat
- 42.8 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Of the rank I upgrades, only ''Offensive 7 mm'' is of noticeable effect to allow for belt choice for the 7.7 mm armaments. The next level's ''Compressor'' should be the first choice, with ''Airframe'' and the ''HSBC mk.2'' as unattractive choices. Having the option of a last-ditch ground attack with the bombs may save the occasional game though. For rank III: ''Engine'', ''New 7 mm MGs'' and ''Wings repair'' in that order, just having the ability to perform long, accurate burst fire (against bombers) makes the armament upgrade worthwhile. The last level is ''Engine Injection''. The remaining modules can be chosen for research by personal preference.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Browning (7.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 12 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg outer x2 + 460 rpg center x2 + 500 rpg inner x2 = 5,840 total)

The {{PAGENAME}} 's signature 12 x 0.303 calibre machine guns means quite a lot of gun for a plane, though the drawback to the gun amount is that they are all rifle-calibre and such the Typhoon's firepower is drawn from the mass amount of bullets that can be laid out. The large amounts of bullet fired works as with the right belt, the Typhoon has a large chance to set fires with the high amount of incendiary in the machine gun belts; for this reason, it is plausible to switch to tracer, as 100% of the tracer belt contains incendiary. Be warned: the tracer rounds are much less powerful than the regular ones, so keep that in mind.

This fighter is an excellent bomber hunter due to its armament's high fire chance, aim for the fuel tanks and let the fire do the rest of the work.

Another plausible idea when flying the {{PAGENAME}} is to uninstall the New 7.7 mm machine guns modification once it has been unlocked. This will increase the weapon's spread and turn the plane into a flying shotgun, but also increase the chance of gun jamming. To reduce the risk of this, boom and extend with this plane and keep firing bursts disciplined, only firing once within 500 m with a convergence of 400 m to make the best use of the rather weak 7.7 mm machine guns.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|G.P. Mk.IV (250 lb)|G.P. Mk.IV (500 lb)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 2 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (500 lb total)
- 2 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,000 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Air Arcade Battles:'''

In regards to air arcade battles, it is advised to use Boom & Zoom tactics, as the aircraft's high power (for battle rating 2.7) and wing loading allows for high speed passes on lower flying planes. With the Typhoon's engine providing 2,000 WEP horsepower, there is a lot of energy for a player to use against their opponents.

When encountering fighters, avoid turn-fights most of the time as this aircraft simply doesn't turn well except against the Fw 190 and most American planes, with the exceptions being the F4F-3, the F4F-4, and the F6F-5. Do rudder turn in 1-v-1s and use the combat flaps; against Arcade players, the Typhoon will win the majority of the time, as Arcade people generally don't know the rudder-turn trick.

The best bet in a bad situation is to either outrun pursuers by engaging WEP and diving, which forces them to break off pursuit, or to just run flat out and hope the magic lead indicator doesn't land them a cockpit shot. Bobbing the plane up and down in the vertical slightly does prevent this.

Set gun convergence at or in excess of 400 m, as 500 m seems to work the best for Boom and Zoom. Do note that due to the fact that in Arcade wing-rip is a non-element, the Typhoon can dive down in excess of 3 km to chew up enemy planes going for ground targets, then climb back to altitude with the remaining prey none the wiser.

Play the Typhoon wisely, as none of these tips will be of any assistance if a pilot persists in flying straight into furballs

'''Air Realistic Battles:'''

The biggest threat to the Typhoon in a downtier is the [[He 100 D-1]] as it can match the Typhoon for top airspeed in level flight, however, the Typhoon can potentially accelerate and out-turn it, meaning that the Typhoon is not without hope.

In an uptier or midtier match there are many more threats: the Bf 109, which can shred the plane with its cannons, has a better climb rate and turn rate, and generally outperforms the Typhoon in all but speed; the Italian planes, which are generally powerful and require situational counters; and the [[Ki-44-II hei|Ki-44-II]]. The Ki-44-II is arguably the most dangerous of them, as its maximum speed nearly equals that of the Typhoon's at a similar altitude, its turning rate is better and its climbing rate exceeds the Typhoon's by at least one metre per second. Beating the Ki-44 requires discipline and good aim; do not turnfight, as the Typhoon cannot keep up with the lighter Japanese plane. Do note that the Typhoon performs better at high altitudes - in excess of 5,500 m or 18,000 ft. Do not engage in turning engagements except with Fw 190s.

If all else fails, run on the deck: the Typhoon can reach in excess of 550 km/h with WEP at 150 m (500 ft) in RB, 512 km/h without, and outspeeds almost every other plane at its battle rating. The Typhoon's WEP is exceptional and lasts far longer before overheating than most other planes in the game at every altitude. Her rate of cooling also sits in the top half of those planes in War Thunder - especially after the Rank II Spitfires got their engine rework.

Against a skilled pilot, the A6M2 and A6M3 are non-issues; they simply do not have the speed, climb rate, or toughness to compete. Do be aware that if these planes catch a Typhoon at low speed and low altitude, they will very easily destroy the Typhoon. If the Typhoon pilot is fortunate enough to possess some altitude, he will pitch down, run, then climb until the plane has the energy to re-engage.

'''Ground Realistic Battles:'''

\*'''Tank realistic battle: "In fast, target blast, out fast."''' One of the unique capacities the Typhoon occupies is having the ability to carry two 500 lb bombs which provides ground strike capabilities.

It is important to learn how to use MEC (manual engine controls) as they are crucial for getting the most potential out of this aircraft, given the lack of auto propeller pitch control.

Using MEC, (which should ideally be within reach of the keyboard hand if on PC, such as the number keys above the WASD keys) hold down the button for 100% Propeller Pitch and Mixture, while using the mouse wheel to control the throttle. Use it to get a quick takeoff, and then set it to 90-93% throttle (using whichever key is assigned to engine control toggle 1) and cruise to the battlefield. It is recommended to keep an eye on the map periodically (Default key: M), to indicate potential targets. By the time the Typhoon reaches the Area of Operations, there should be a target in mind. Fly around the far outskirts of the map, to an angle of approach that is believed to be the opposite of where the target is looking. Considering the Typhoon will likely be going over 400 km/h (250 mph), wait until the target is about to be in sight, then toggle engine controls back on, hold the MECs to 100%, dump the throttle, Gear on/Flaps Landing (once below 400 km/h), Gear Off. doing so will effectively perform a hard braking manoeuvre, slowing the plane down enough to accurately place the munitions. Make sure to set the timers on the bombs to at least 3-5 seconds, as the bombs going off too early will likely destroy the piloting aircraft with the shock wave.

Once the bombs have been dropped, raise the flaps, throttle WEP and run out of there as quickly as possible before the enemy SPAA can react.

The biggest advantage to this method is the Typhoon can effectively enter the airspace, and engage targets faster most other aircraft, with as little warning to enemy forces as possible excepting enemy aircraft. At the same time, because of the Typhoon's brutal acceleration, it can engage a target and then use its superior speed (against ground attackers like Stukas, Russian light bombers, Japanese light bombers) to annihilate enemy air forces using the 12 machine guns.

The Hawker Typhoon was a single-seat, all-metal monoplane fighter, first designed as a high speed interceptor.

Even before the new Hurricane fighter was launched into full-scale production, the engineers of Hawker Aircraft Ltd.'s design office, headed by Sir Sydney Camm, embarked on the development of а next-generation interceptor for the RAF. It was proposed that the new aircraft would be equipped with a new engine whose power would surpass that of the Rolls-Royce Merlin.

Hawker Aircraft received a contract to develop two prototypes: one had a Rolls-Royce Vulture liquid-cooled engine (an Х-block); the second had a Napier Sabre engine (an Н-block). Both engines had 24 cylinders and provided about 2,000 hp.

The first prototype was named the Hawker Tornado and featured a ventral radiator in the same position that the Hurricane did. The second prototype, named the Typhoon, was equipped with a distinctive chin-mounted radiator in the forward fuselage.

Since the development of the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine progressed more quickly, the Hawker Tornado was the first to be test flown in October 1939. The first Hawker Typhoon (P5212) prototype made its maiden flight in February 1940.

After delays caused by the Battle of Britain, the full-scale production of Typhoon Mk IA, with a 2,100 hp Napier Sabre Mk.IIA engine and a de Havilland Hydromatic three-bladed propeller, was launched. Work on the Hawker Tornado was ceased due to serious problems with the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine after the first production aircraft was built.

Subsequent to the results found during flight trials, the tail fin of the Typhoon Mk.IA was enlarged to improve longitudinal stability and the aircraft obtained its distinctive rudder with a straight rear edge. The starboard door and the folding part of the canopy were used to enter the fighter's cockpit; in an emergency both doors and the folding part of the canopy could be jettisoned.

The armament provided for the aircraft consisted of wing-mounted machine guns in the "A" type wing (Mk.IA) and cannons in the "B" type wing (Mk.IB). The first 110 fighters built were of the Typhoon Mk.IA version, with 12 wing-mounted 0.303 inch Colt-Browning Mk.II machine guns, because of the shortage of belt-feed mechanisms for the Hispano Mk.II cannons.

The early service life of the Typhoon was less than impressive. With a relatively poor rate of climb and sluggish performance at high altitudes, it was not able to maintain pace with the latest enemy fighters in its planned role as an interceptor. Furthermore, the first RAF squadrons to use the Typhoon found, like the test pilots who had helped to develop the Typhoon, that an alarming number of accidents, sometimes fatal, were attributed to the new fighter. Hawker was able to ascertain that the cause of many accidents was metal fatigue resulting in several cases of the entire tail section detaching in flight. However, even after this issue was resolved, high speed buffeting and an unreliable engine caused the early Typhoons to be less than popular with their crews.
