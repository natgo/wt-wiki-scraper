== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

The Typhoon is a heavily armed, fast fighter bomber which excels in Boom and Zoom tactics. It is armed with four deadly Hispano cannons, which can obliterate enemy fighters with the air targets belt. With all modules purchased, the Typhoon is one of the fastest planes in its tier, reaching speeds of almost 700 km/h in level flight. You also have an excellent climb rate and great manoeuvrability, enabling you to dogfight quite effectively against some targets.

You also get some decent payload options. A choice of 2 x 250, 500 or 1,000 lb bombs or 8 x RP-3 rockets allow you to hit enemy ground targets hard and fast. Just beware that carrying such payloads will adversely affect your flight characteristics. In realistic battles ground forces, it is best to assess the situation on the battlefield. If the enemy team is ground forces heavy, you can choose to thin them out with bombs or rockets. You can even use your cannons to good effect on light targets like the Wirbelwind and PT-76. If the enemy team has a high volume of aircraft in the air, leave the payload and just focus on taking them out.

== Usage in battles ==
<!--''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->
The Typhoon Mk Ib/L, like the other Typhoons, is a superb altitude fighter, able to dive down on unaware enemies and strike; then take off with the speed it gained from diving to gain a high altitude for the purpose of either doing a second pass on an enemy or to engage a new enemy target. It has a great speed for a 4.3/4.7(RB/AB) but its insufficient climbing speed makes it possible for enemy threats to outclimb it.

Major threats to the Typhoon Mk Ib/L are aircraft like [[Yak-3]], [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109's]], [[A7M (Family)|A7M]] and [[P-38L-5-LO]] which are able to outclimb, turn faster, and keep up or outrun the Typhoon, making them deadly enemies for it to face. However, the strong structure of the Typhoon's wings make it able to outdive most of them to get away. 

In Arcade battles, the 4 x 20 mm are effective against most aircraft and with boost of speed and climb rate, it is able to climb high and it will be easier to do "hit and run" tactics where it will shine most. Engaging enemies in dogfights are not the strong suit of the Typhoon and it is ill advised to do so in any battle mode.

In Realistic battles, it is an excellent Boom and Zoomer, able to get high altitude and dive on unsuspecting pilots. The climbing speed is sufficient to make it outclimb and do well as a Hit and Run aircraft in lower rating battles, but in higher rating battles it will have fierce competition in the sky.

The Typhoon is also an excellent option to take into Ground Battles, being able to carry 2 x 1,000 lbs, 2 x 500 lbs, 2 x 250 lbs or 8 x [[RP-3]] rockets into battle, making it capable to assist and support ground units in battle, Also 4 x 20 mm with ground target ammunition can strafe at right angles to immobilize or do critical damage to most enemy tanks from above, buying time and protecting allied ground units from potential threats.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Retains energy well: great Boom & Zoom aircraft
* Can also turnfight [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109s]] when between 350 and 450 km/h IAS
* Armed with 4 x 20 mm Hispano cannons
* Bubble canopy allows for a great visibility, especially in SB
* Excellent climb rate
* Structural strentgh of wings helps the Typhoon survive high-speed dives 
* Versatile set of belts, great for ground RB.
* Has four suspended ordnance options (three varieties of bombs and RP-3 rockets)

'''Cons:'''

* Terrible roll rate
* Cannon recoil can cause aircraft to lose speed and the Hispanos easily jam
* Plane controls start to lock when beyond 537 km/h
* Bombs negate your turn rate advantage
* Plane can be difficult to play when stock
* Engine can overheat easily and will suffer at high altitude

The Hawker Typhoon was a single engine, single seat fighter which first entered service with the RAF in 1941. Typhoon fighters of the first production series were equipped with a canopy with massive framing and a Rover-produced car-type side door for cockpit access. The first modification of this was to replace some of the solid metal fairings with transparent panels and cut down the pilot's head armour plate to help increase visibility. Lack of visibility remained a significant problem and whilst a new canopy was being developed, the bulky radio mast and its fairing were replaced with a whip aerial further aft along the fuselage. A new drop-shaped canopy was designed for the pilot's cockpit, providing a good all-round view. The new canopies were fitted on the production aircraft from September 1943 on.

The fighters were equipped with more powerful 2,200 hp Napier Sabre Mk.IIB and 2,260 hp Napier Sabre Mk.IIC engines, as well as new four-bladed de Havilland propellers. The wing-mounted armament consisted of four 20 mm British Hispano Mk.II belt-fed cannons with 140 rounds per gun. The projecting cannon barrels were equipped with fairings to reduce drag.

By the end of 1943, these improvements had been implemented on the majority of the Typhoons already in service.

By the time these later Mk IBs were in service, the aircraft's shortcomings as a fighter had been identified, but it coped perfectly in the role of a fighter-bomber and a close air-support aircraft, striking German airfields, communication lines, railways, and ships.

Since Typhoons were flown at low altitudes under strong enemy anti-aircraft fire, the designers paid great attention to protecting the pilot and the aircraft's vital systems. The pilot's head and back were protected with an armoured backrest and a 38-mm-thick armoured glass windscreen. An armour plate protecting the engine was fitted behind the propeller fairing.

After many early teething problems, critical failures and threats to be withdrawn from service altogether, the Typhoon finally found its niche as a rugged, dependable ground attack aircraft. It achieved notoriety amongst German soldiers during the Normandy campaign when, whilst Spitfires were achieving air superiority, the Typhoons were able to cause mayhem amongst German ground units. The Typhoon's production was discontinued in November 1945, and it was withdrawn from service in early 1947. All in all, 3,205 Hawker Typhoon Mk.IB aircraft were produced.
