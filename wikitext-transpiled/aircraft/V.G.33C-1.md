== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]].

The V.G.33 can adequately deal with planes with similar BR. It is quick, nimble (to an extent), and powerful. Its machine guns and single propeller-mounted 20 mm do a decent amount of damage. However, it lacks armour, so take that into account when engaging other aircraft.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 3 mm Steel plate between engine and oil cooling system.

{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|MAC 1934 (7.5 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon, nose-mounted (60 rpg)
* 4 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 2,000 total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The V.G.33C-1 is a very competitive aircraft at its battle rating, with decent climb rate, good speed and good manoeuvrability. Its biggest weaknesses are its lack of ammunition and lack of armour. To take advantage of this plane, it's best to side climb and exploit any opportunities that will present themselves. Both turnfighting and BnZ tactics work well with this plane but turnfighting is the better of the two due to the lack of ammo, it also allows for, generally speaking, a better and cleaner shot. Trigger control is key when flying this plane. Though not as manoeuvrable as a spitfire, it can sustain a turnfight with an F6F, Yak-7 or Yak-9, but against a fighter like a I-16, you can use your high horsepower engine in a steep climb while dodging out of the way of its guns, to stall it out so you can finish him off with your 7.5 mm MGs.

In mixed ground battles, your anti-tank capabilities are limited as the penetration of your 20 mm Hispano 404 cannon is insufficient. Up close, you can penetrate the roof of the Pz.III, and perhaps the engine deck, depending on angle. Your main target shouldn't be ground vehicles, but strike aircraft and fighters. With your relatively weak armament, bombers will be tough to bring down, and the fragile inline engine cannot take much fire before becoming inoperable.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 20 mm cannon is very dangerous, especially with high explosive ammunition
* Relatively fast
* Excellent manoeuvrability
* Impressive efficiency of 4 x 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns
* Amazing climb rate, about as good as the BF-109s
* Excellent high altitude performance
* Amazing energy retention, probably the best for what it faces
* Lightweight can zoom climb away from most enemies in the middle of a dogfight
* High energy retention when exiting a dive

'''Cons:'''

* 20 mm cannon has very small ammo pool
* 20 mm cannon under-performs until you research new ammunition belts
* Weak survivability, especially the fuel tanks and inline engine
* Below average roll rate
* No combat take-off flaps
* The engine overheats quickly at low altitude (below 4,000 m / 12,000 ft)

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
