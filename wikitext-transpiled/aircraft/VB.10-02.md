== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. This aircraft was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 50 mm Bulletproof glass in front and rear of the cockpit.

== Armaments ==

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)|Browning M2 (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannons, wing-mounted (150 rpg = 600 total)
- 6 x 12.7 mm Browning M2 machine guns, wing-mounted (400 rpg = 2,400 total)

The six machine guns and four cannons are arranged in bundles of three and two respectively when mounted in each wing. Each of the cannons contains the same number of rounds and each of the machine guns respectively contains the same number of rounds, however, if fired continuously, the cannons will run out of ammunition before the machine guns will.

== Usage in battles ==

<!--''Describe the tactics of playing in an aircraft, the features of using vehicles in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->

Like most heavy fighters, the VB. 10-02 does well with a somewhat passive playstyle. Poor manoeuvrability means that dogfights against single engine fighters are generally a bad idea, and boom and zoom tactics should be used instead. Your biggest threats are G55s and G-series Bf 109s, as they can outperform you in every aspect other than diving speed and burst mass. Due to the mediocre climb speed and a fairly low altitude air spawn, most single engine fighters will climb to 4-5 km before you, so side-climbing is recommended. While the plane is lacking in armour, the excellent armament does allow you to win head-ons more often than not.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarize and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Excellent firepower
- Has an air spawn
- Elevator doesn't lock up much at high speed
- Very good ammunition capacity, especially on the 50cal machine guns
- Great acceleration in a dive, high wing rip speed
- Maintains speed well after a dive, even if the maximum level flight speed is exceeded

'''Cons:'''

- Below average climb rate and acceleration
- Poor roll rate
- Stock 20mm guns jam very quickly
- Below average turn rate
- Poor rudder effectiveness at high speeds
- Engines overheat quickly under WEP

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too big, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/ History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== Encyclopedia Info ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Arsenal first replaced the dual Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 860 hp engines with the new 12Z-12/13 version, which increased the VB.10-02 horsepower to 1150. The cockpit canopy was also redesigned into a teardrop shape, and weapons were added to it.

Even before the second prototype was tested, the French government, already impressed by projected performance figures, ordered 200 of the aircraft. Unfortunately, because jet propulsion was increasingly seen as the future of fighter planes, interest in piston-engine fighters steadily dropped thereafter. In addition, while the French air force was establishing their own fleet of jet aircraft, they used American and British piston engine fighters as transitional equipment.

Due to waning interest and the use of allied planes in the interim, the French Air Force ultimately cancelled its initial order for the 200 VB.10-02 aircraft in September 1948, after the fourth production aircraft had been delivered. As a result, only six VB.10 aircraft were produced: the two initial prototype models, and the four production models.
