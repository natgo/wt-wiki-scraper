== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]].

The VB.10 is a twin-engine fighter, with the second engine hidden behind the pilot driving its own set of propeller. Owing to its sleek design and contra-rotating propellers, it might appear as a single engine super-prop fighter. With 2 engines, the plane can achieve high speeds but it is heavy and does not fare well in dogfights.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 50 mm Bulletproof glass in front and rear of the cockpit.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano 404 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannons, wing-mounted (150 rpg = 600 total)

The four cannons are arranged in bundles of two mounted in each wing. Each is armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire with each other until empty.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in an aircraft, the features of using vehicles in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The VB.10C-1, like most heavy fighters, is reliant on side climbing to engage enemy fighters, however this isn't the only way to play the VB.10C-1, if you decide to side climb and wait for enemy planes to drop down to lower altitudes they will find themselves in peril when a experienced pilot in a VB.10C-1 comes booming past with its quick dive rate and deadly armament of 4 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannons. The best tactic when flying solo is Boom & Zoom and play as the team's support fighter, as its great acceleration and heavy weight can allow you to make fast attacks against unsuspecting enemy fighters at lower altitudes that are pre-occupied with fighting friendly aircraft. The heavy weight can also help carry the planes speed when extending and helps retain a bit of speed when going back into a climb, be aware however that the VB.10C-1's size and weight makes it a considerable target if you happen to miss your engagement. The best tactic when flying in a group of two or more is to help teammates that are struggling in a dogfight with enemy fighters, as a large target the VB.10C-1 can distract enemy fighters and outrun most using its advantage in weight and energy which allows teammates to slide onto the enemies six o'clock and finish them off.

If you need to do a quick turn, set combat flaps and reduce the power of the engine to around 50%, then turn and close the combat flaps when half-finished with your manoeuvre. Be aware that turning in the VB.10C-1 is a way to intentionally or unintentionally bleed off any built-up energy. Conserve energy when possible in the VB.10C-1 as it lacks the capabilities to dogfight other fighters in fast or slow turning engagements.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarize and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very fast at all altitudes, especially in a dive
- Competitive climb rate at most altitudes
- Good turn rate for it size
- Good cockpit visibility (important for simulator battle players)
- Can fly well with one engine, improving its chance to limp back to the airfield for repairs

'''Cons'''

- The hidden rear-mounted engine can be hit by a chasing enemy
- Heavy plane, resulting into poor flat acceleration and roll rate
- Rudder is unresponsive at high speeds
- Guns are mounted far from the centre, can make lining up shot difficult
- Relatively low ammo count

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too big, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/ History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

'''Development'''

The Arsenal VB-10 was a continuation in development from the earlier [[V.G.33C-1|VG-33]] aircraft designed during the early war period but unable to be manufactured in great numbers before the Battle of France which began in May 1940.

Under the Vichy government, the prior prototypes were reconsidered, and updated designs needed to be produced. Thus, the VB-10’s distinctive design of liquid cooled tandem engines were born. This was a method of circumnavigating the lack of a 2,000 HP engine with two 1,000 HP engines<ref>Hartmann, G. (2007) ''L’Arsenal de l’aéronautique''. p. 4-7. [pdf] Available at: <<nowiki>http://www.hydroretro.net</nowiki>> [Accessed 13 August 2021].</ref>. The new design was higher performance than two similar American interceptor projects; the XP-62<ref>Bowers, P. (1979) ''Curtiss aircraft, 1907-1947.'' London: Putnam & Company Ltd, pp. 327–331.</ref> and XP-67<ref>Francillon, R. (1988) ''McDonnell Douglas aircraft since 1920''. London: Putnam Aeronautical Books, p. 372.</ref>, the twinned engine system producing a higher top speed and competitive rates of climb and service range during a test flight in July 1945.<ref name=":0">Green, W., Swanborough, G. (2001) ''The Complete Book of Fighters: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Every Fighter Aircraft Built and Flown''. London: Salamander Books, pp. 30-31.</ref>

'''Production'''

An initial order for 200 aircraft was placed after a test flight of the second prototype in September 1946 to enter service post-war, though this was reduced to 50 within three years. The first VB-10 took flight on 3<sup>rd</sup> November 1947 with Hispano-Suiza HS 12Z Ars 15/16 engines and the now standard armament for the prototype, four 20 mm cannons, replacing the prototypes' prior 23.7 mm machine guns.

The order was cancelled in September 1948 after just four of the aircraft were completed and tested. During the tests, mechanical failures caused two serious crashes, one of which was fatal and the aircraft were scrapped. The French Air Force would rely on foreign Allied fighter aircraft until the national production of jet-powered fighters began.<ref name=":0" />
