== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Red Skies"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7267-event-summer-landing-en|2021 Summer Landing event]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good top speed
* Adequate climb rate
* Powerful weaponry with good belts

'''Cons:'''

* The guns are inconsistent
* Rolling will kick the aircraft's nose in random directions
* Not very agile, control surfaces have very bad response
* Low rip speed
* Compresses heavily in dive

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In the leadup to the Winter War, the Finnish military was hastily building up its fighting strength, including that of its air force. Despite it being clear that the demand for new aircraft couldn’t be met by the limited Finnish aviation industry, the military nonetheless issued a set of requirements to the State Aircraft Factory in order to come up with a new design in early 1939.

The prototype, named Myrsky (Finn. for "Storm"), made her maiden flight in December 1941, after which started a long program of correcting identified issues. In the fall of 1942, serial production of the fighter began, with the main problems of the original version solved - the aircraft in serial production were designated Myrsky II. By the time the batch production was completed, the flight and combat qualities of the fighter were no longer satisfied with the military. The Myrsky II shortly served in the final stages of the war and was decommissioned in 1947. Including prototypes, a total of 51 Myrsky IIs were built.
