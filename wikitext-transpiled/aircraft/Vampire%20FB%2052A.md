== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]]. It is the first jet in the Italian tree's export fighter line, and is placed after the [[Re.2005 serie 0]]. It is followed by the rank VI fighter, the [[CL-13 Mk.4]]. The Vampire FB 52A is an export version of the British Vampire FB 6, itself an upgraded version of the [[Vampire FB 5]] with an improved engine.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Vampire cannot reach the speeds a [[MiG-9 (l)]] or an [[F2H-2]] can, it cannot accelerate as well as many of its counterparts, and it is appalling in a dive against most of its opponents. However, the Vampire has one impressive advantage against its jet-powered opponents: it can turn incredibly well. In fact, a good analogy to flying the Vampire is fighting jets in propeller aircraft.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

;Armour Plates

*38 mm Bulletproof glass in front of pilot.
*12.7 mm Steel plate behind the pilot's head.
\*3 mm Steel plate below the engine.

The Vampire provides adequate protection to the pilot, as well as some armour under the engine. As with most jets, damage to the wings or fuselage greatly hampers flight performance, decreasing top speed and manoeuvrability. There are quite a few fuel tanks located in this plane's wings, so fuel fires may be common, especially when taking a high fuel loadout.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|Hispano Mk.V (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.V cannons, chin-mounted (150 rpg = 600 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|H.E. M.C. Mk.13 (1,000 lb)|RP-3}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 2 x 1,000 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.13 bombs (2,000 lb total)
- 8 x RP-3 rockets

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Vampire is well-known for its ability to turn on a dime, but its incredible manoeuvrability also means that it has poor manoeuvring energy retention. Climbing is important for this plane, as is careful airspeed maintenance. When in a battle situation, it is advisable to always stay above 400 km/h; any slower, and the Vampire will greatly struggle to evade enemy fire.

If the Vampire is able to keep its energy, it becomes one of the best dogfighters at this rank. It can outturn nearly every other jet of its tier, and has a powerful engine to boot. Thanks to its great manoeuvrability, it is often quite easy to line up a shot against the enemy. One common tactic is to try luring the enemy into a turnfight. The Vampire will almost always come out on top. However, never commit to a dogfight if there are multiple enemies nearby. Turning will cause the Vampire's airspeed to fall dramatically, at which point enemies can easily swoop in and destroy it.

It is valuable to note that the Vampire has a low top speed for a jet, at only ~880 km/h. It also tends to compress as higher speeds. The Vampire may have difficulty in chasing down a faster enemy. Also note that firing the main cannon armament causes a downward recoil.

For attacking ground targets, the Vampire can be equipped with either bombs or rockets.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Powerful armament
- Great manoeuvrability
- Decent payload options
- Good cockpit visibility
- Good at gliding without engine power

'''Cons:'''

- Low top speed and acceleration
- Weapon create significant recoil
- Poor dive rate

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The de Havilland Vampire was an early British jet fighter. Its development began in 1941 and the design boasted several novel features. It was powered by a single turbojet engine in contrast to the twin engined [[Meteor (Family)|Gloster Meteor]] due to the availability of more powerful engines; most production Vampires were powered by the Goblin engine, also manufactured by the de Havilland company. The twin-boom tail design allowed the fuselage to be kept short, reducing the length of the jet pipe and maximizing the amount of effective thrust by minimizing energy losses from friction. The air intakes were also located in the wing roots as opposed to directly in front of the engine. The fuselage was largely constructed of balsa wood as on the [[Mosquito (Family)|de Havilland Mosquito]]. While the Vampire first flew only months after the Meteor in 1943, it arrived too late to see combat in World War II. In Royal Air Force service, the initial Vampire F.1 variant replaced propeller fighters. Later fighter-bomber versions under the "FB" designation were capable of serving ground attack roles, leaving air defence to the better suited Meteor. While the Vampire was not an impressive jet aircraft in terms of speed, climb rate, or range, it was agile and easy to handle. It would ultimately equip 33 air forces over more than 30 years of service. The RAF retired the Vampire from combat roles in 1954 but retained the trainer variants until 1971. The design was developed further into the [[Venom FB.4|de Havilland Venom]], which had a new engine and wing.

The Vampire FB.52 was an export version of the Vampire FB.6, which itself was sold to and license produced by Switzerland. Compared to the preceding [[Vampire FB 5|FB.5]], the FB.6 had a new Goblin 3 engine offering about 1.1 kN/112 kgf of extra thrust over the Goblin 2. The basic FB.52 was exported to Norway, New Zealand, and other operators. The '''Vampire FB.52A''' was a subvariant for Italy with minor differences. According to one source, the Italian Air Force received 51 FB.52As from Britain in 1950, and 195 subsequent aircraft were manufactured locally by Fiat and Macchi. Other sources differ on the production numbers. A considerable number of FB.52As were delivered by Italy to Egypt and possibly Syria from 1955-56.

The Vampire's service in Italian hands was uneventful. They were retired by 1960, being replaced by the [[F-84G-21-RE (Italy)|F-84 Thunderjet]] and other aircraft. The Egyptian Air Force used its Vampires, largely consisting of FB.52s and FB.52As, in conflicts with Israel. Several were lost to Israeli Meteors and many were destroyed during the invasion of the Suez Canal in 1956. Afterwards, the Vampires were retired and replaced with Soviet aircraft.
