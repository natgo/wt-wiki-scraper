== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good DEFA cannons for fighting air targets
* Wide variety of bomb and rocket payloads for ground targets
* Has Shafrir missiles for possible self-defense against air targets

'''Cons:'''

* Bomb load is pretty inadequate, may have issues destroying multiple bases
* Shafrir missiles are not very manoeuvrable against fighter targets
* Has no bomber sight

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Vautour IIA was a jet bomber ordered by the French Army as a jet bomber with low level attack and the ability to operate in all weather. France and Israel worked together on defense, such as on nuclear, aviation, and research for armaments. Israel was motivated to buy the Vautour to counteract the Egyptian [[IL-28]], purchased from the Soviet Union. A total of 30 IIAs were produced, with 25 going to Israel.<ref>"Sud-Ouest S.O. 4050 Vautour." IAF Aircraft Inventory. Jewish Virtual Library. Accessed September 27, 2022. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/sud-ouest-s-o-4050-vautour.</ref>

The IIA was a single-seat, long-range attack aircraft armed with cannons and bombs. It was operated by the "Knights of the Heart" squadron out of Ramat David Airbase. The Vautour was used as aerial reconnaissance during the Six-Day War, as well as later in the 1960s. They were replaced by the [[A-4H (Israel)|A-4 Skyhawk]] and the [[F-4E Phantom II (Israel)|F4-E Phantom II]]. The Vautour was retired in 1972, with the "Knights of the Heart" division replacing them with the Skyhawk.
