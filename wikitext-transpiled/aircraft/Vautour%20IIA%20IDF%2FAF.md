== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French jet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]] as a [[wt:/en/news/6072-shop-update-1-87-pre-orders-en|premium pack]] in the Gaijin store and was removed from the store with the introduction of the [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Vautour has decent manoeuvrability (for a bomber), but you shouldn't be turning with anything to begin with. Where this plane really shines is the acceleration owing to the two powerful engines in the underling nacelles and the heavy air frame. Which makes it amazing in the vertical. But since you can't have everything, the wings will break in prolonged >7g manoeuvres. Essentially you don't want to do any insane manoeuvres, and risk getting sent back to the hanger.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 2 mm steel behind rearmost fuel tank
* 2 mm steel in the rear fuselage
* 3 mm steel surrounding the pilot
* 6 mm steel in front of pilot's controls
* 13.5 mm steel in front of pilot's controls
* 13.5 mm steel headrest
* 50 mm bulletproof in front of pilot
* Self-sealing fuel tanks (4 in the fuselage, 1 in each wing)

This thing can take quite a lot of punishment before going down due to the bomber's damage model.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

# The usual "rush the base and run away" style that all Jet bombers can do and excel at. There's nothing wrong with this, but it's not where the Vautour excels.
# Ignore all the other payloads and load up on missiles. This arguably the more interesting way to play, but there are risks involved as well. i.e. having the whole enemy team pick the Vautour as a priority target.

If you take the missiles, here's how you want to play it:

Look for high altitude dots, these usually mean other jet bombers or the odd Tu-4. The missiles are not that effective at a range greater then 1 km. The farther that missiles are fired, the greater the chance of the locked-on enemy have in evading the missile. On the off hand that the first missile misses, the Vautour has four of them, so a follow-up shot is an encouraged option.

Once in a while, look around and support your team, especially the teammates that are engaging the enemy. If an ally has an enemy at their tail, work around towards the enemy's rear and fire off a missile to take care of them. This can be beneficial if a long chain of alternating enemy and ally fighters have got together, as each of them try to hit the fighter at their front and evade the fighter at their tail. If able to pounce on these chains, come in from the very rear and take out the very last enemy fighter in this chain. This will either cause the chain to break-up, potentially freeing up pressure on your allies, or the chain will continue without noticing the Vautour's presence. In the latter case, continue towards the next enemy and take them out one-by-one.

Once all missiles are expended, switch to the guns, which are powerful enough to take care of any enemies unfortunate to be in front of them. However, high-speeds will cause the controls to be less responsive, so fine-manoeuvring for these gun-runs may be difficult. If the gun pass misses, itch up and use the Vautour's amazing vertical energy retention to reset and try again. Usually the guns don't get much use as the missiles will completely overshadow them.

Overall, this plane destroys people who don't pay attention and or make bad plays. The most effective way to lock it down is to simply look back sporadically, just to make sure nothing's behind you.

;Enemies of note:

F-100's: These things will out speed you and outmanoeuvre you in the vertical. If one happens to latch onto your 6, drag him away from his friends and force him to overshoot. Then, assuming the reversal was successful, throw a missile at them. Most F-100 may not be aware that the Vautour has missiles, and so firing off a missile can destroy the F-100 while it is supersonic.

Vautours: The Vautour's great performance means its greatest enemy is going to be itself. Be especially wary on maps like Hokkaido, where there's thick cloud cover. They have a tendency to come out of nowhere, destroy you and retreat back into the cloud cover like some air-borne monster.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Normally able to reach bombing points before being intercepted
* Good top speed, able to keep up with fighters at its rank
* Good energy retention
* Versatile, has access to a wide range of ordnance including air-to-air missiles
* Great guns

'''Cons:'''

* Poor manoeuvrability
* Vulnerable to missiles, has difficulty dodging them
* Transonic and supersonic aircraft can easily match your speed
* Shafrir missiles are only slightly better than [[AIM-9B]]s
* Missiles have a very limited range, 2.5 km optimal range
* No bombing sight
* Unguided rockets are inaccurate

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The French Vautour twin-engine bomber had been produced in three variants between 1956 and 1959. In 1960, after four years in service, the French Armee de l'Air divested itself of its 25 surviving Vautour II-A single seat ground attack planes, along with its 40 II-B two-seater bombers, selling them to Israel, which kept them in service until the 1970s.
