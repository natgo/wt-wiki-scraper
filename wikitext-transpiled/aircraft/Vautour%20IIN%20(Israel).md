=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

[[File:Armour Vautour IIN (Israel).png|thumb|right|300px|13.5 mm plates in both the front and rear of the pilots]]
The Vautour IIN has a respectable amount of armour around the pilots. In front of the forward-most pilot houses a 50 mm bulletproof glass pane and 2 steel plates (13.5 mm and 6 mm) sandwiched together to protect the pilot's lower body. In addition, both crew members sit in a 3 mm steel "bathtub" encasing most of the crew's body. The rear pilot has rearward protection with another 13.5 mm steel plate covering the back of his head. Lastly, there are 2 x 2 mm steel plates in the rear of the aircraft. There is no armour protecting the engines, so they are very prone to damage. Like many planes at this battle rating, the Vautour also has self-sealing fuel tanks.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Vautour IIN is a jet bomber that is capable of many different play styles. The IIN can use its radar to seek out players at high altitude, or stay low to the ground with bombs and attack enemy bases/vehicles,

'''Air Realistic Battles'''

The Vautour IIN, being a jet bomber, doesn't lend itself very well to any sort of dogfight against its adversaries. The compression, handling, and overall sluggish nature of the IIN make it a very hard plane to focus solely on enemy fighters. It's best to use it as a support fighter: picking off enemies that are distracted or other attackers/bombers who aren't as manoeuvrable as fighters. The IIN also gets access to four [[Shafrir|Shafrir 1's]], which can be used to force enemies to turn, destroy other bombers and get AI planes. The four DEFA 30 mm cannons can easily shred planes apart in a tiny burst. Unlike its predecessor, the Vautour IIA, the IIN has a very capable radar complete with IFF that makes spotting planes out of visual range much easier.

If going after planes is difficult in the Vautour IIN, it can also access bombs and rockets. A loadout with rockets and bombs can prove to be very efficient in draining the enemy team's tickets. In addition, the armored target belt can very easily destroy light pillboxes and any category of tanks (Light, Medium, Heavy) and other AI ground targets. However, be wary of the compression and do not get greedy while going after targets.

At a battle rating of 9.0, there are many noteworthy adversaries. Uptiers to 10.0/9.7 are very common, which means you will see [[Su-25|Su-25s]] with [[R-60M|R-60Ms]], [[A-10A Late|A-10s]] with [[AIM-9L_Sidewinder|AIM-9Ls]], and other planes with very manoeuvrable missiles. Furthermore, your main advantage, speed, will be nullified by planes like the [[MiG-19_(Family)|MiG-19]], [[F-100_(Family)|F-100]], [[MiG-21_(Family)|MiG-21]], and more. To stay effective during the match, it's best to side-climb and stay out of the way of many of these dangerous foes. In downtiers, many planes are slower than the Vautour, which allows the Vautour to utilize its speed to run away and stay safe. Your main opponents in a downtier will be many other similar BR planes like the [[MiG-17AS]] and the [[Sea Vixen F.A.W. Mk.2|Sea Vixen]] which are both fast and use missiles.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Fast (1000+ km/h / 625 mph)
- Good bomb load and rockets
- 4 hard-hitting DEFA 30 mm cannons
- Able to hold 4 Shafrir air-to-air missiles
- Good energy retention

'''Cons:'''

- Sluggish handling
- Can constantly be uptiered
- Very large turn radius
- Compression at high speeds can make it hard to hit opponents with guns

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Vautour IIN was a two-seat, all-weather interceptor variant of [[S.O.4050 Vautour IIA|Vautour IIA]] with radar, and armed with cannons, air-to-air missiles, and unguided rockets. It was operated by the "Bat" squadron out of Tel Nof Airbase, until the arrival of the [[Mirage IIICJ|Mirage IIIC]], when they were handed over to the "Knights of the Heart" division at Ramat David Airbase. The Vautour was used as aerial reconnaissance and night interceptors during the Six-Day War, as well as later in the 1960s. They were replaced by the [[A-4H (Israel)|A-4 Skyhawk]] and the [[F-4E Phantom II (Israel)|F4-E Phantom]]. The Vautour was retired in 1972, with the "Knights of the Heart" division replacing them with the Skyhawk.
