== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].

Naturally, the Venom follows the basic principles of jet combat. It must keep its speed, turn when necessary, the pilot should avoid speed costly manoeuvres and prefer lag-displacement manoeuvres to any sort of deceleration manoeuvre, unless in critical situations in which the method of energy loss should never be shutting the engine off - instead, utilize the Venom's air brakes.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Venom's play style should be a healthy mix of the two dominating ways of flying jet fighters. The Venom is a fast aircraft, and keeping it fast is important in order to keep up with enemies and to have enough energy to sustain manoeuvres - so the Venom is indeed a good high-speed performer. However, it does not best either the [[MiG-15bis]] or the [[F-86F-2]] in level flight. Therefore, speed alone cannot be relied on for fighting jets.

On the other hand, the impressive thrust-to-weight ratio of the Venom's engine means that pilots should use its sustained rate of climb as an advantage. When fighting Soviet opposition - mostly [[MiG-15]]s, the advantage in rate of climb falls in relevance, since that is one of the MiG's great trump cards. However, Venom pilots should always climb a bit instead of "mowing the lawn". 600 to 800 km/h is a good range of speed to climb into the battlefield, maintaining airspeed, yet gaining altitude and opening the range of opportunities to engage.

Venom pilots should avoid being alone - in fact, the Venom can excel at baiting enemies and/or making them lose energy, leaving them vulnerable to engagement by allied fighters. The fact that the Venom is not the fastest jet means that being alone vs two or more enemies requires a multitude of defensive manoeuvres (the Venom excels at lag displacement rolls aka. barrel rolls) to come out alive. Sometimes, all it takes is a barrel roll to get behind an enemy and shoot it down, but against multiple opponents that think before manoeuvring, being alone can spell disaster.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very manoeuvrable for a jet, comparable to the [[Meteor F Mk 8 G.41K|Meteor Mk 8]] with a better roll rate
- Good sustained climb rate, capable of catching up to Me 163s in a sustained climb
- Stable gun platform
- Better cockpit visibility than the Vampire by a bit, depending on your preference it may be the second best to the Hawker Hunter

'''Cons:'''

- Inefficient air brakes
- Tail strikes on take-off and landings may be devastating
- Reaches wing-ripping G-forces easily (+12 G)
- Reaches G-LOC easily thanks to manoeuvrability

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The de Havilland DH112 Venom was a single engine jet fighter which entered service with the Royal Air Force in 1952. Initially developed as a private venture with plans for the export market, the Venom was a direct successor to the de Havilland Vampire and shared the earlier fighter's twin tail boom design and composite structure. However, the Venom was fitted with a more powerful de Havilland Ghost jet engine which had begun testing as early as 1944 and had a new, thinner wing. The aircraft was armed with four 20mm Hispano cannon and provisions for up to 2000 lbs of bombs or eight 60 lb rockets.

A prototype first flew on September 2nd 1949 and after a successful period of testing, the first production model Venoms to enter service were the FB1, equipping No.11 Squadron based in Germany in August 1952. A two-seat night fighter variant equipped with radar - the NF2 - entered service with No.23 Squadron at Coltishall in November 1953. After a maiden test flight on 29th December 1953, the Venom FB4 variant entered service with the RAF in 1955. Featuring a modified tailplane, an improved de Havilland Ghost 105 jet engine rated at 5150 lbf and an ejector seat, some 250 were manufactured. This was the final land based version of the aircraft to see service in Britain, although variants of the Sea Venom continued to serve in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm.

RAF Venom FB4s of Nos 6, 8 and 249 Squadrons operating out of Akrotiri in Cyprus flew alongside Royal Navy Sea Venoms in the Suez Crisis of 1956. Venoms were mainly used in the strike role, attacking Egyptian airfields and shipping. Further conflicts where the Venom saw operational use included Malaya, Aden, Oman and Kenya, as well as part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force based in Germany.

Although the Venom's performance built considerably on that of the Vampire it was still, in effect, a first generation jet fighter and was largely outperformed by contemporaries such as the F86 Sabre or MiG 15. The last RAF Venoms were retired in 1962, although export variants were also used by Sweden, Venezuela, Iraq, Australia and Switzerland – the final Swiss Venoms were not retired until 1983.
