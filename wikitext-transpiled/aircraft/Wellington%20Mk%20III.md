== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
====Air battles====
In Air Battles, the winning tactic is to climb high and bomb your targets. If you don't want to climb the {{PAGENAME}}, is a great low flying bomber, offering great speed and manoeuvrability. However, it lacks any armour and only offers limited protection with turrets in the front, side and rear. It lacks armour plates, unlike other bombers of the other nations. A few well placed shots will see {{PAGENAME}}, getting torn apart to any aircraft which drop down to engage it from the top or belly. However, its rear gun turret offers four 7.7 mm machine guns which are able to shoot down the enemy aircraft with a few well placed shots.

====Ground battles====
[[File:Wellington Torp Launching technic.jpg|thumb|right|364x364px|"Torpedo attack!" The best way to launch a torpedo at close range without sacrificing the aircraft, is to find the middle ground between the suggested drop direction and the target. That way making the evasive action of the torpedoes, harder. Whether the target slows down or turns, The torpedoes will be on collision course]]
Using the {{PAGENAME}} should be used as a strategic bomber, that is what it excels at in this game mode. It is too big to be used in the ground attack role, making it an easy target for enemy tankers. To use the {{PAGENAME}}, load up on 500 lbs or the single 4,000 lb cookie bomb. The 500 lbs, offer 65.5 Kg of HE filler and the cookie offers 1,339 kg of explosive filler.

Fly around the map, waiting for the enemy to cap the cap zones, when they start capping the zone - head towards it while gaining altitude. Do not come in low as a single shot fired from a tank can knock you out of the game. Once at a good height, line up on the cap zone and drop the bombs. Any tank in the zone will be destroyed.

==== Naval battles ====
All of the Wellington bombers are well suited for the naval warfare, The {{PAGENAME}} being one of the best of them provides improved Browning turrets, highest top speed of them all and two supreme payloads that will allow you to change the tides of a naval war in both Arcade and Realistic battles.

Those are:

* 2 х 18 inch Mark XII torpedoes
* 1 x 4,000 lb H.C. Mk.II bomb

With the torpedoes, the strategy goes in finding a good approach angle to successfully deliver both torpedoes to preferably gunboats and destroyers as they will have a tougher time evading them. Beware of anti-aircraft fire and swiftly turn back to safety while preparing the next drop.

The technique at the moment of launching the torpedoes is shown in the image: "Torpedo attack!"

Using the 4,000 lb bomb, the scenario takes place a bit higher. Way above the enemies' short and medium anti-aircraft guns that reach around 3,000 - 4,500 m altitude. Here you will be able to spot the biggest of the fishes. Those will be your targets and with some developed practice in predicting the drops you will decimate the entire enemy destroyers population in a short time, tanks to this extremely lethal bomb.

Just be alert of enemy planes that will be eager to take you down, using the Armoured targets belt provides some of the boost in defence you need as it cripples engines and pierces through metal.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has twice as many tail guns as its predecessor
* Can carry a reasonable maximum payload for a medium bomber
* Engines seem to be indestructible and will remain operational even under heavy fire
* Can survive belly landings if need be
* Half-decent at operating in the gunship role
* Engines are capable of using WEP

'''Cons:'''

* Weaponry consists purely of 7.7 mm machine guns, making fighting against fighters a serious challenge at best
* Low speed makes the lack of defensive guns painfully obvious
* Anything with a cannon will be able to destroy the bomber without much effort
* Gun turrets have no protective armour, leaving turret gunners vulnerable
* Although you can carry torpedoes, they are some of the worst ones in the game due to the terrible drop requirements
* Tail controls are easily knocked out from fighters or flak

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
The Vickers Wellington was a twin-engine medium bomber used by RAF Bomber Command and Coastal Command. In May 1939, a prototype Wellington was fitted with Bristol Hercules engines; after successful trials with a converted Mk.IC, this model was launched for full-scale production at the beginning of 1941 under the designation of Wellington Mk.III (Type 417).

Production Mk.III aircraft were equipped with two 1,590 hp Bristol Hercules Mk.XI radial, air-cooled engines.

Building on the experience amassed by Wellington crews, the defensive armament was upgraded on later models; the Frazer-Nash FN-5A rear turret with two 0.303 inch machine guns was replaced with a Frazer-Nash FN-20 turret holding four 0.303 inch machine guns with 2,000 rounds each. The take-off weight of the Mk.III was increased to 15,650 kg while bomb capacity was reduced to 4,000 lbs (1,814 kg). Originally, the bomber was to be equipped with a ventral turret, the low-drag Frazer-Nash FN-21A, but the further decrease in bomb capacity was deemed to be unacceptable.

The Mk.III had its armour reinforced, all fuel tanks were self-sealing and barrage balloon cable cutters were positioned in the leading edge of the wings.

By 1941 the Wellington was used almost exclusively at night and therefore, attention was given to decreasing the area of the glazing that visibly reflected moonlight or searchlight beams during night flights. To that end, the Mk.III differed from the late Mk.IC aircraft by removing side glazing and the side blisters of the bombardier/navigator's cockpit. The only side glazing that remained was from the trapezoidal gun blisters.

The Wellington Mk.III was manufactured until the end of 1943, and a combined total of 1,519 bombers were produced.
