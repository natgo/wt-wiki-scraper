== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

* 60 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit front.
* 9 mm Steel plates in the nose.
* 4 mm Steel plate in pilot's seat.
* 6 mm Steel plate behind the pilot.

{{main|Hispano Mk.I (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.I cannons, nose-mounted (60 rpg = 240 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|G.P. Mk.IV (250 lb)|G.P. Mk.IV (500 lb)|S.A.P. Mk.II (500 lb)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (500 lb total)
* 2 x 500 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (1,000 lb total)
* 2 x 500 lb S.A.P. Mk.II bombs (1,000 lb total)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Whirlwind Mk I should be used similarly to other heavy fighters. The flight characteristics are very similar to the [[Whirlwind P.9]] with the main difference being significantly less ammo.

The Whirlwind Mk I is very effective in a boom and zoom role due to its good climb rate and powerful armament. However, the relatively low wing break speed in RB does limit you in this role. The Whirlwind Mk I has a good turn rate for a heavy fighter, but will be easily out turned by single-engined fighters. The use of combat flaps will help to balance out this disadvantage. Care must be taken when using the combat flaps, however, as they are prone to snapping off at a relatively low speed.

At this BR you will see many [[BV 238]]s and [[Me 264]]s. Heading on these bombers will usually guarantee you a kill, but you still need to be careful of the powerful defensive armament of them. The Whirlwind Mk I has relatively little ammunition with only 60 rounds per gun. It is important to be accurate to be successful with this aircraft. To help with accuracy try to get very close to the target before shooting.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Devastating nose-mounted 20 mm Hispano armament
* Great for head-ons
* Good turn rate when upgraded for a twin-engined fighter
* Able to carry bombs, unlike P.9 variant

'''Cons:'''

* Poor climb rate
* Under-powered engines
* Drum-fed Hispano Mk1s. Only 60 rounds per gun. You must make every round count
* Inaccurate Hispano Mk1 cannons. Precise aiming is hard
* Poor roll rate
* Quite slow level flight speed
* Unfavourable matchmaking puts you up against some very challenging opponents
* Hispano Mk 1 cannons do not have access to more effective air targets belt

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Westland Whirlwind was designed after a specification was issued by the British Air Ministry. The specification called for a cannon-armed day and night fighter. The Air Ministry wanted a top speed of at least 530 km/h at an altitude of 4,600 m. Out of five designs offered by the companies. The Air Ministry decided to go with Westland's design for several important reasons. The cannon was mounted on the nose so that the recoil does not affect the accuracy of the gun. There were also no convergence problem as compared to other single-engine fighters with wing mounted guns. The requirements also led to the world's first bubble canopies on a plane. However the decision to arm the Spitfire with cannon and the development of other twin engine fighters such as the Bristol Beaufighter has led Fighter Command to use the Whirlwind less and less as the war progressed. The first batch of Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines were also delayed. It was also found that the engine was severely under-powered and the drum magazines used to feed the cannons were small in capacity. All of this has resulted in the Whirlwind's cancellation and resulted in the plane only equipping two RAF squadrons.
