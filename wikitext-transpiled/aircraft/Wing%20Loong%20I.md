== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

After seeing the potential of UCAVs (Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles) during the Iraq War that began in 2003, a team of engineers from Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group began development on a prototype of their own for the People's Liberation Army Air Forces. After testing, the team would go on to develop the '''Wing Loong I''' (翼龙-1; Pterosaur-1), designated by the PLAAF as the GJ-1 (攻击-1; attacker-1), which was shown off at the 2010 Zhuhai air show. It has been in service with the PLAAF since the early-2010s and versions have been exported to multiple countries, especially in Asia and the Middle East.

Introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]], the Wing Loong I is not a researchable vehicle; instead, it is accessible in ground battles by players using Chinese vehicles for a cost of 750 spawn points. Players can use the Wing Loong I's missiles effectively against enemy ground targets from long ranges. However, it is to be noted that the high SP cost to spawn a Strike UCAV should be weighed against other available options, such as aircraft and helicopters. It is recommended to only use the Wing Loong I if the player has no other close-air support option or deems the drone's benefits to be worth the high spawn cost.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->
The Wing Loong I is unarmoured as it is not designed to confront enemies directly. Therefore, its airframe cannot survive much damage from enemy fire. Be it surface-to-air missiles, air-to-air missiles, aircraft cannon fire or proximity-fused shells, it is recommended to stay away from the battlefield to avoid getting hit at all costs. The Wing Loong I's long wings are prone to damage. A notable benefit that drones have over manned aircraft is that there is no pilot, so one will not "black out" while initiating high G manoeuvres and control will be able to be maintained as long as the airframe is intact.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AKD-9|AKD-10}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 2 x AKD-9 missiles
* 2 x AKD-10 missiles

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Like other Strike UCAVs in the game, the Wing Loong I is available to all players playing China in high-tier ground battles and is beneficial to players who lack appropriate close air support aircraft or attack helicopter options in their lineup.

The Wing Loong I will spawn at 4,000 m above the battlefield. It is recommended to target enemy SPAAs first. Enemy SPAAs are usually sitting stationary at their spawns, though some anti-aircraft vehicles may be positioned closer to the front lines as well. Taking out these vehicles will allow for friendly aircraft and helicopters to obtain air superiority and begin attacking enemy ground targets unhindered. If there are no SPAAs around, the next important targets will be enemy tanks that are on or near the capture points. Once all armament has been expended, a Wing Loong I pilot has three options:

# '''Recon:''' This involves flying around the battlefield and scanning the area with the Wing Loong I's camera and thermal imager. Enemy ground vehicles across the battlefield can be marked for the team, and enemy heliports and airfields can be monitored for activity.
# '''Rearm:''' A return to the airfield for rearmament. Due to the Wing Loong I's slow speed, it will take a significant amount of time to go to the airfield and then return to battle. Upon approaching the battlefield again, the drone may not be able to climb to an optimal altitude to stay away from enemy air defense. Note that UCAVs cannot resupply at heliports.
# '''Respawn:''' Abandoning the drone and spawning in a new helicopter, aircraft or ground vehicle using spawn points collected while attacking ground targets. After neutralizing enemy SPAA, the skies may be clear enough to continue striking from the air. If other types of enemy vehicles have been destroyed, capture points and strategic positions may be clear to enter on the ground.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Spawns at altitude, near the battlefield
* Excellent stabilized camera with thermal imager
* Decent turn radius
* Effective missile armament
* Small target for enemy air defense
* No pilot to suffer the effects of high G forces

'''Cons:'''

* Low maximum speed, can take a long time to enter and return to battle
* Poor climb rate
* Some unusual flight characteristics while manoeuvring
* Unarmoured fuselage and vulnerable long wings
* No countermeasures
* High SP cost compared to other aircraft options

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Mainland China has closely observed different types of UCAVs (Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles), especially those which have overflown China or have been shot down by the PLAAF. As the US Air Force and Israel have proved the necessity of deploying UCAVs for recon or eliminating ground targets, the development of domestic UCAVs was given the green light in the early 2000s with limited resources under a team headed by Li Yidong (李屹东) of the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.

Li Yidong's team managed to gather spare parts from gliders and civilian products, such as the brakes from motorcycles, and constructed an early prototype within 2 years. However, doing so meant that the team had to build a new UCAV from scratch with every possible new standard introduced to the production specifications. With 100 orders placed overseas and using new technology developed during the production of the Chengdu J-10, the new Wing Loong UCAV was developed and passed for testing in 2007. Its mock-up was first revealed in the 2010 Zhuhai airshow.

Eventually, the Wing Loong was introduced to the People's Liberation Army Air Forces in the early 2010s. The production model was first shown to the public in the 2012 Zhuhai airshow, then the 2015 VJ Day parade as GJ-1 UCAV. Countries in Central Asia and the Middle East purchased multiple batches of these drones and they became the cornerstone of Chinese export weapons. The Wing Loong has scored multiple victories over insurgents and sometimes even fellow UCAVs, alongside the CH (彩虹, Rainbow) series developed by the CASC.
