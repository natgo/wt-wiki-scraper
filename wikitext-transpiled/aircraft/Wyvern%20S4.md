== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Interest in a long-range naval strike fighter gave rise to the Wyvern project, which was to take the Rolls-Royce Eagle-22 engine to cover operations. The project was struck with setbacks, most eventful was the cancellation of the Eagle engine causing considerable time and effort to be lost when searching for another suitable engine that was available. It was decided to utilize a turboprop engine instead and the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine was selected for installation into the Wyvern. The Wyvern with the Python engine was accepted into service in 1953, designated the ''Wyvern TF 4'' initially before renamed into the '''{{PAGENAME}}'''. Seeing limited service in the Fleet Air Arm as a carrier aircraft, it was eventually withdrawn in 1958.

Introduced in [[Update 1.59 "Flaming Arrows"]], the Wyvern's distinctive marks are its turboprop engine and large ordnance payload. Its exceptional speed capabilities and wide range of available armaments make the Wyvern an excellent choice for combined arms battles. The Wyvern can also be a strong fighter though terrible in high altitudes as engine power drops significantly above 3,000 meters altitude. However, the Wyvern's drawback is its poor maneuverability, so engaging in a dogfight with this aircraft is generally not advised as it would likely end unfavorably for the Wyvern's pilot. Engage in Boom-n-Zoom attacks to make the most of the Wyvern's speed and minimize the maneuverability penalty.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Wyvern S4, being a turboprop, is an exceptionally fast aircraft for its battle rating. Though a prop aircraft, the Wyvern functions very similar to jet aircraft in play style, due to the nature of its weight and engine. Though the Wyvern does have an above average climb rate due to its powerful engine, it functions best near sea level. At sea level, where the engine functions at maximum capacity, the Wyvern is almost uncatchable. Being able to maintain nearly 640 km/h in level flight without a payload, even enemies diving on the Wyvern will have trouble catching up, and will quickly fall behind as they lose energy.

Though it can go incredibly fast, this is solely due to the aircraft's powerful turboprop engine. Coming in at a heavy 7 tonnes with no payload, or 9 and a half tonnes with its maximum payload, the Wyvern's speed suffers when performing any manoeuvre bar going in a straight line. Even minor adjustments will cause the fighter to bleed speed at an alarming rate, with full-out turns able to halve the aircraft's speed before it has even completed a 180. Whilst it has the speed, the Wyvern can turn very fast but as mentioned it will lose this speed in the turn very quickly. Unless absolutely necessary, avoid performing any but the most gentle of manoeuvres in this 7 tonne beast.

This focus on simply flying straight is further amplified by the turboprop's ability, or lack thereof, to quickly react to input changes. As happens in jet aircraft, the turboprop engine found on the Wyvern will take a fairly long amount of time to react to changes to the throttle meaning the Wyvern pilot will struggle to regain speed if the throttle is dropped at any point, such as to recover from a vertical stall manoeuvre.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Speed, climb rate, and armament are the Wyvern's only real method of taking out enemy aircraft. These are the strengths that any pilot of the Wyvern should always exploit, by employing Boom & Run tactics on enemies. With four Mk V Hispano cannons, and a staggeringly large ammo reserve, the Wyvern is more than equipped to quickly dispatch any aircraft that end up in front of it. The pilot should only take the plane up to a maximum of a couple thousand meters, unless bomber hunting, and use the Wyvern's excellent acceleration and top speed to quickly annihilate any enemies who end up on low altitude. The Wyvern can also use this speed to bait enemies, who see the Wyvern as an easy target, down to low altitudes. This will allow allied fighters to easily establish high altitude air superiority, which can often end up in victory by itself, without the Wyvern pilot actually putting himself in any great danger.

With its wide variety of secondary armaments, the Wyvern is one of the best aircraft available to the British at this BR. Typically, load up three 1,000 lb bombs, and use them to fully destroy one bombing point. The Wyvern is taken to its maximum weight whilst carrying this payload, and will only be able to maintain around 550 km/h at sea level, so the pilot should attempt to drop the bombs as soon as he can, to regain the Wyvern's 640 km/h top speed. Using the four Mk V Hispano cannons, preferably with Air Targets ammunition loaded, employ the Wyvern as was detailed in the above section, as a boom-and-zoom aircraft at low altitude. If one had experience flying any jet aircraft in the past, use the Wyvern exactly as a jet. Do not turn for anyone, if a pass misses then continue onward until a great distance is gained, then turn around for another guns run.

While fighting, any pilot should refrain from turn fighting and perform energy fighting whenever possible

In Ground Forces, the pilot has the choice between using three 500 lb bombs, three 1,000 lb bombs, sixteen RP-3 rockets, or sixteen AP Mk I rockets. With such an armament, the Wyvern's distinctive engine sound can signal in the incoming doom of any tank unfortunate enough to end up in the pilot's vision.

In Naval Battles, the Wyvern can be used as a fighter-bomber. The 3 x 1,000 lb bombs will allow you to destroy most targets with direct hits and once free of the bomb load you are free to kill any other bombers or fighters around with relative ease.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Exceptional low-altitude engine performance (550 km/h-640km/h with payload/no payload)
* Powerful offensive armament, with large ammo reserves
* Diverse selection of secondary armament
* Above average manoeuvrability at high speeds
* Excellent dive performance
* Surprisingly high climb rate
* Reasonably capable of Boom & Zoom, which will allow this premium plane to make even more money
* In addition to carrying 3 x 1,000 lb bombs, you can release them separately from one another
* It has an airbrake, a rare item at its BR
* Highly versatile, serving as both an attack aircraft, or fighter capable of opportunistic kills and a bomber with its bomb capability
* Good visibility around the cockpit

'''Cons:'''

* Exceedingly heavy (7 t unloaded, 9+ t with a payload)
* Large fuel tanks located in front of the wings
* Turboprop engine is more fragile than traditional piston-engines planes: any engine damage represents a significant impact on performance
* Very bad roll rate
* Below average high-altitude engine performance
* Poor engine response to throttle adjustment
* Distinctive engine sound, unlike any other aircraft
* Extremely loud propulsion system allows for easy detection
* Despite being able to throw the 3 x 1000 lb bombs independently, if only one bomb is dropped the weight load would be uneven and affect turning and rolling performance
* No mirrors in cockpit to look behind, forcing the player to constantly look behind for enemies in simulation mode

The Wyvern was one of the few turboprop combat aircraft ever fully developed, and entered service long after World War II had ended. The design was a relic of an era past, with jet-powered aircraft now replacing propeller aircraft. It also suffered from a long development period, beginning in 1944 as the P.10. This lead to the Wyvern seeing very little combat use and being quickly retired. The Wyvern S.4 variant contained an Armstrong Siddeley Python 3 turboprop engine, able to output 3670 horsepower, and was the first and only variant of the Wyvern to enter service with the British Royal Navy.

The Wyvern S.4 only saw actual combat in late 1956 during the Suez Crisis, racking up 79 sorties and 2 losses. This marked the Wyvern as the only British turboprop to ever see combat.<ref>http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=1482</ref>

The type was plagued with various engine problems during its brief period in service, and was retired soon after in 1958.
