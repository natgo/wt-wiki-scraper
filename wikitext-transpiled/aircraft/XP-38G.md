== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. It was available in the Gaijin Store until it was replaced by the [[YP-38]] in [[Update "Raining Fire"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

Despite being a heavy twin engine fighter, the XP-38G has a quite good overall performance. Its level speed is comparable to many single-engined fighters and even faster than some of them. It can reach 550 km/h at the sea level and, thanks to its superchargers, the plane's maximum speed is close to 660 km/h at 5,000 m altitude and it doesn't drop or increase up to 11,000 m, that makes it a good medium and high altitude fighter and, in most cases, outperforms the opposition.

Climb rate is comparable to other American fighters, the plane is able to reach 5,000 m in 4 minutes and 40 seconds which is quite mediocre, its climb rate at 1,000 m is close to 18 m/s, but again thanks to the supercharger it will not suffer so much at high altitude. When climbing from 5,000 m alt to 9,000 m alt, it will outperform most other fighters. Acceleration in level flight is decent and when it starts diving it gets very good. It is required to keep an eye on the speed because the maximum structural speed limit is low in this plane compared to how fast it can accelerate.

The XP-38G's turn rate is quite good but depends a lot on its Fowler flaps, they do increase the lift a lot but the drag too. Sustained turn rate is quite good, better than in almost every other heavy twin-engined fighter, but in most cases only comparable or worse to other fighters. On the other hand, the instantaneous turn rate, especially with deployed flaps, is very good and can help a lot with getting the guns on the target for high deflection shooting. Of course, due to the plane's configuration, it suffers a lot from high speed compression, which starts close to 0.70 Mach. The other issue is its roll rate, at best it reaches 70 degrees per second at 400 km/h. The way the Lighting's engines are set makes it so the pilot does not need to worry about the propeller torque effect, so the plane doesn't require any trimming except for some elevator adjustments to fly in a straight line.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

- 38 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit top front.
- 6.5 mm Steel plates in the nose.
- 6.5 mm Steel plates in pilot's seat.
- 9.5 mm Steel plate in pilot's headrest.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|AN/M2 (20 mm)|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 1 x 20 mm AN/M2 cannon, nose-mounted (150 rpg)
- 4 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 2,000 total)

The armament on the XP-38G is extremely powerful. A single 20 mm cannon combined with 4 x M2 Brownings in the nose make a devastating, accurate combination. The XP-38G can effectively slice wings in half due to its extremely accurate weapons.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|M8}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- Without load
- 6 x M8 rockets

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Utilize the P-38 as a strike fighter. The P-38 has very good energy retention and climb speed, so mainly use it as a BnZ fighter. However, it can be an effective turn fighter against less manoeuvrable opponents. Be warned, however, that once at a low speed and altitude the P-38 is a sitting duck. It is a very large fighter and easy to destroy.

The best cure is being prepared. Always maintain a high, safe altitude. If you have to, the P-38 is best in a flat dive. Its roll rate can be used to its advantage as well. Use diving and climbing manoeuvres to get out of trouble. Avoid turning to counter opponents, unless they are less manoeuvrable.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Gathers speed quickly in a dive
- Good armament, can rip apart other planes quickly
- Good for Boom & Zoom
- Good climb rate

'''Cons:'''

- Extremely prone to fire
- Poor turning/manoeuvrability

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The XP-38G in game is actually fictional, created during the very early days of development as an improved performance Premium P-38G. The closest equivalent to the game's fictional XP-38G is a P-38H (600 built) or a P-38K-1 (1 built), which had a few minor performance improvements to the P-38G.

The P-38 was an all-metal, three-wheeled, single-seater, twin-engined monoplane fighter with an aerodynamic design rarely seen in World War II.

An experimental XP-38 (Model 22) was first flown on January 27, 1938. Production began in June of 1941.

The G variant was created at the end of 1942 and was based on the E and F variants. The G had a more powerful turbocharged Allison V-1710-51/55 engine. Engine management was significantly more automated than before.

The plane carried a formidable armament consisting of 20mm Hispano AN/M2 cannons with 150 rounds and four 12.7 mm Colt-Browning M2 .50 cal machine guns with 300 rounds apiece. The P-38G had a reinforced fuselage and could carry two extra 300-gallon (1136 l) fuel tanks. The G was not equipped to carry rockets and bombs, but was often modified on the field to carry 250 lb or even 500 lb bombs as well as unguided rockets.

The P-38G was widely used by the Army Air Force (USAAF) in all theaters of the war. They were often used for shuttle missions over Germany from the airfields of Ukraine. The best known operation in which the P-38G participated was Operation Lightning, which changed the war in the Pacific. The mission, which was flown on April 18, 1943, intercepted and shot down a Japanese G4M1 bomber with Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto on board. In addition, the P-38 was the plane of choice of the two most successful American aces: Richard Ira Bong (40 kills) and Thomas McGuire (38 kills).

From 1942 to 1943, Lockheed built 1,462 P-38Gs. They were decommissioned in 1949.
