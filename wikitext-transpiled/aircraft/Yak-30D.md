The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.59 "Flaming Arrows"]].

Lacking external ordnance, the Yak-30 is purely a fighter/bomber interceptor and excels in such a role.

Many people tend to ignore the Yak-30 for its easier-to-grind contemporary, the [[La-15]], although it is needed to get to the Yak-38 so the grind may be worth it. Those who persist, however, are awarded a faster and more durable airframe (unlike that of the La-15); however, this comparison isn't entirely fair either. The La-15 is generally much more agile at lower speeds and also carries significantly more cannon ammunition. As such, the preference between the Yak-30 and La-15 will vary depending on play style. Those that want a dependable and speedy fighter should choose the Yak-30; those that want an agile and ammo-friendly fighter should choose the La-15.

Unlike previous Yak jets (such as the Yak-23/17/15) the Yak-30 is a conventional swept-wing jet fighter that performs much more akin to the famed Mig-15/17 than its more manoeuvrable, straight-winged forebears. At its BR, the Yak-30 is an excellent aircraft that can compete with the best other nations have to offer, if played right and not uptiered.

The Yak-30 is incredibly fast, capable of over 1,000 km/h in level flight. Unfortunately, acceleration over 850 km/h isn't particularly good and significant energy is lost in any sort of manoeuvre at those speeds.

Please note that the Yak-30 starts to compresses significantly at high speeds and cannot effectively make high-speed deflection shots unless the target in question is flying idly and is not spatially aware.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Yak-30 is the first plane from the Yakovlev line of fighters to incorporate swept wings. Although it uses the same Klimov RD-500 engine compared to its predecessor due to aerodynamics improvements the maximum level speed is over 100 km/h higher and can reach 1026 km/h at sea level when flying at 112% of power.
Its acceleration is better than in many other jet fighters at similar battle rating, for example a F-84G, F2H or M.D.452. Thrust to weight ratio which is 0.45 is comparable to its main real life competitors, the MiG-15 and La-15. The same about the climb rate performance, at sea level it is close to ~40 m/s, better when compared to jet fighters from other nations.
The main downside is the engine overheating, it cannot fly at full power for too long, the time limit is 5 minutes and 10 minutes for flying at 100%.

The turn rate performance is very good, it can perform a full horizontal circle in around 20 seconds, which is a very good time, close to propeller driven planes.
This along with quite good roll rate which can reach up to 115 degrees per second makes the plane very good in dogfight situations at low and medium speed, but once it starts getting close to transonic speeds the Yak-30 will start to suffer from high speed compressibility and make aiming difficult.
The G limits are high for this kind of plane, the player will not have to worry about breaking a wing. It also has access to an airbrake that can keep it from reaching the structural speed limit (1080 km/h IAS) and flaps which can be extended in three positions that can improve the turning performance a lot, but their speed limit is low, in combat position it is around 500 km/h IAS.
Overall the plane is very similar to the La-15, the only difference being slightly worse roll rate, higher speed limit and better turn rate.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 3 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, chin-mounted (75 rpg = 225 total)

The two right mounted cannons can be fired independently of the left mounted one, allowing for potential conservation of ammunition.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
If downtiered, Boom & Zoom is the tactic that should be employed with the Yak-30; it is key to keep your speed above 750 km/h at all times to give yourself a chance of running away if the engagement you are partaking in turns into the enemies favour. Although the Yak-30 at the specified speed is able to turn with most of its targets, don't depend on turning with your enemy as you may be caught off guard and unable to react if another enemy player enters the engagement. If you encounter an enemy who is on par or faster than your Yak-30, refer to the paragraph below.

If uptiered, Energy fighting or (if the engagement calls for it) turn fighting may be employed for the Yak-30; It is absolutely vital to know your enemies strengths and weaknesses. Your best tactic to use is deception; never let the enemy guess where you're going to go next. Keep the Yak-30 in its state of compression for as long as possible; At such high speeds, the Yak-30 is still manoeuvrable enough to out turn most of the jets it will face, causing a chasing enemy to overshoot or in rare cases, rip their wings off. A good tactic for engaging faster jets is to let them get onto your tail before baiting them into a turn. continue the turn until the enemy has lost a reasonably large chunk of energy before zooming away; The Yak-30's acceleration at low to medium speeds is still exceptional and will aid you with opening a gap between the enemy and you for setting up an actual dogfight.

====Specific enemies worth noting====
<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->
[[G.91_R/1|G.91s]], [[Me 163 B|Me 163s]] and [[Me 262 C-2b|Me 262 C-2b]]s are all effective matches for the Yak-30.
The G.91s are the most comparable fighter to the Yak-30, like a MiG-15's F-86 Sabre or a Spitfire's Bf 109; facing off against one relies on the skill of the pilot and other external factors such as prior damage or altitude. A Yak-30's strength against a G.91 is its ability to compress and airframe strength (it is possible to make a chasing G.91 rip its wings executing the same manoeuvre as you at certain speeds). If you end up in a one-on-one engagement with a G.91, make sure to read your opponent and guess what their next move is going to be. Be patient and wait for your enemy to make a mistake.

====Counter-tactics====
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->
Defensive flying is a strong point of the Yak-30 due to its relatively high turn rate at all speeds. Its roll rate although not being good at high speeds, can still be used in conjunction with other control surfaces to throw the enemy off and gain neutral ground. Careful throttle/flap control can always be used to great effect against any higher-energy opponent; however- the Yak-30 is no Yak-23- the Yak-30 will not and cannot accelerate and climb to disengage. Effective teamwork and squads can help eliminate most disadvantages a Yak-30 pilot may experience against any opposing fighter.
The Yak-30 does not like damage; a single burst of a .50cal weapon is able to cripple the Yak-30's ability to manoeuvre and therefore is an easy target.
Although being fast for its BR, its top speed is its downfall in uptier matches where most jets will be able to catch the Yak-30.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Guns are deadly when they work
* Good energy retention
* Good acceleration (up to 600-700 km/h)
* Decent manoeuvrability
* God-like turn rate below 600 km/h, specially when using flaps
* Good zoom-climb rate
* Engine has 112% throttle for added thrust
* Difficult to rip the wings

'''Cons:'''

* Control surfaces compress significantly at higher speeds
* Low ammo count
* Guns are hard to aim
* Unreliable guns that are notoriously ineffective at times
* Engine overheats easily at 112% throttle, use with caution!
* Minimal fuel load is usually too little for Air RB matches
* Flaps are easy to break if not careful
* Mediocre acceleration past 600 km/h
* Tends to be uptiered constantly, which faces aircraft that outclasses it in many ways

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Yak-30 was the unsuccessful rival to the MiG-15. Design of the Yakovlev prototype, to the same specification as the MiG, fell behind its competitor and the Yak did not have its first flight until the MiG had already completed service trials. Its own September 1948 debut indicated it was a strong aircraft with excellent handling and good all-round performance, but it never moved past the prototype stage.
