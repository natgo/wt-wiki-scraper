The Yak-30 was Yakovlev's attempt to compete with Mikoyan-Gurevich after the limited success of the Yak-23 and all their jets using the Yak-3 fuselage. The Yak-30 was a completely new design based on the experimental Yak-25, however this variant included a swept wing for better performance at high speeds. The aircraft test trials started after its first flight in 1948 but it proved unsatisfactory, thus a new version with most of the problems fixed was developed, the Yak-30D. This new variant showed good results but the superior MiG-15 was already in production and thus the project was cancelled.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.59 "Flaming Arrows"]]. The Yak-30D is a very capable jet fighter with a playstyle very similar to that of contemporary Soviet fighters like the La-15 and MiG-15. The Yak-30D excels at high speed performance (around 800-900 km/h), it's capable of more than 1,000 km/h at sea level when the thrust is set to 112%, note that this extra power consumes more fuel. However, the engine is better accelerating at lower speeds and at more than 850 km/h it loses energy relatively fast in any manoeuvres. The aircraft compresses significantly at high speeds and control of the aircraft is tricky, thus for avoiding missiles or starting dogfights it is better to lose speed to around 800-900 km/h. However, unlike the Yak-23, the Yak-30D has an airbrake to lose that unnecessary speed when needed.

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Yak-30 is the first plane from the Yakovlev line of fighters to incorporate swept wings. Although it uses the same Klimov RD-500 engine compared to its predecessor due to aerodynamics improvements the maximum level speed is over 100 km/h higher and can reach 1026 km/h at sea level when flying at 112% of power.
Its acceleration is better than in many other jet fighters at similar battle rating, for example a F-84G, F2H or M.D.452. Thrust to weight ratio which is 0.45 is comparable to its main real life competitors, the MiG-15 and La-15. The same about the climb rate performance, at sea level it is close to ~40 m/s, better when compared to jet fighters from other nations.
The main downside is the engine overheating, it cannot fly at full power for too long, the time limit is 5 minutes and 10 minutes for flying at 100%.

The turn rate performance is very good, it can perform a full horizontal circle in around 20 seconds, which is a very good time, close to propeller driven planes.
This along with quite good roll rate which can reach up to 115 degrees per second makes the plane very good in dogfight situations at low and medium speed, but once it starts getting close to transonic speeds the Yak-30 will start to suffer from high speed compressibility and make aiming difficult.
The G limits are high for this kind of plane, the player will not have to worry about breaking a wing. It also has access to an airbrake that can keep it from reaching the structural speed limit (1,080 km/h IAS) and flaps which can be extended in three positions that can improve the turning performance a lot, but their speed limit is low, in combat position it is around 500 km/h IAS.
Overall the plane is very similar to the La-15, the only difference being slightly worse roll rate, higher speed limit and better turn rate.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|NR-23 (23 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 3 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, chin-mounted (75 rpg = 225 total)

The two right mounted cannons can be fired independently of the left mounted one, allowing for potential conservation of ammunition.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
If downtiered, Boom & Zoom is the tactic that should be employed with the Yak-30; it is key to keep your speed above 750 km/h at all times to give yourself a chance of running away if the engagement you are partaking in turns into the enemies favour. Although the Yak-30 at the specified speed is able to turn with most of its targets, don't depend on turning with your enemy as you may be caught off guard and unable to react if another enemy player enters the engagement. If you encounter an enemy who is on par or faster than your Yak-30, refer to the paragraph below.

If uptiered, Energy fighting or (if the engagement calls for it) turn fighting may be employed for the Yak-30; It is absolutely vital to know your enemies strengths and weaknesses. Your best tactic to use is deception; never let the enemy guess where you're going to go next. Keep the Yak-30 in its state of compression for as long as possible; At such high speeds, the Yak-30 is still manoeuvrable enough to out turn most of the jets it will face, causing a chasing enemy to overshoot or in rare cases, rip their wings off. A good tactic for engaging faster jets is to let them get onto your tail before baiting them into a turn. continue the turn until the enemy has lost a reasonably large chunk of energy before zooming away; The Yak-30's acceleration at low to medium speeds is still exceptional and will aid you with opening a gap between the enemy and you for setting up an actual dogfight.

====Specific enemies worth noting====
<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->
[[G.91_R/1|G.91s]], [[Me 163 B|Me 163s]] and [[Me 262 C-2b|Me 262 C-2b]]s are all effective matches for the Yak-30.
The G.91s are the most comparable fighter to the Yak-30, like a MiG-15's F-86 Sabre or a Spitfire's Bf 109; facing off against one relies on the skill of the pilot and other external factors such as prior damage or altitude. A Yak-30's strength against a G.91 is its ability to compress and airframe strength (it is possible to make a chasing G.91 rip its wings executing the same manoeuvre as you at certain speeds). If you end up in a one-on-one engagement with a G.91, make sure to read your opponent and guess what their next move is going to be. Be patient and wait for your enemy to make a mistake.

====Counter-tactics====
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->
Defensive flying is a strong point of the Yak-30 due to its relatively high turn rate at all speeds. Its roll rate although not being good at high speeds, can still be used in conjunction with other control surfaces to throw the enemy off and gain neutral ground. Careful throttle/flap control can always be used to great effect against any higher-energy opponent; however- the Yak-30 is no Yak-23- the Yak-30 will not and cannot accelerate and climb to disengage. Effective teamwork and squads can help eliminate most disadvantages a Yak-30 pilot may experience against any opposing fighter.
The Yak-30 does not like damage; a single burst of a .50cal weapon is able to cripple the Yak-30's ability to manoeuvre and therefore is an easy target.
Although being fast for its BR, its top speed is its downfall in uptier matches where most jets will be able to catch the Yak-30.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Guns are deadly when they work
* Good energy retention
* Good acceleration (up to 600-700 km/h)
* Decent manoeuvrability
* God-like turn rate below 600 km/h, specially when using flaps
* Good zoom-climb rate
* Engine has 112% throttle for added thrust
* Difficult to rip the wings

'''Cons:'''

* Control surfaces compress significantly at higher speeds
* Low ammo count
* Guns are hard to aim
* Unreliable guns that are notoriously ineffective at times
* Engine overheats easily at 112% throttle, use with caution!
* Minimal fuel load is usually too little for Air RB matches
* Flaps are easy to break if not careful
* Mediocre acceleration past 600 km/h
* Tends to be uptiered constantly, which faces aircraft that outclasses it in many ways

The Soviet Yak-30 was an experimental fighter/interceptor developed from the failed Yak-25 with a swept wing design similar to that found in early cold war fighter jets like the MiG-15 and F-86 Sabre. The design in fact was largely similar to the Yak-25 and the most important change was the addition of the swept wing at 35°. The development of the Yak-25 ended in 1948, the same year the Yak-30 took to the skies.

The Yak-30 was the unsuccessful rival to the MiG-15. Designed by Yakovlev to compete with the MiG-15 for the same contract, it fell behind its competitor and the Yak did not have its first flight until the MiG had already completed service trials. The Yak-30 answered to the Soviet requirement of a new light fighter capable of reaching Mach 0.9 and to operate from unpaved and unprepared airstrips.

The aircraft was fitted with 3 x NR-23 cannons with 75 rounds per gun, better suited for dogfighting than the armament found on the MiG-15 but worse for bomber interception. The Yak-30 also retained the same engine as the Yak-23, a single Klimov RD-500 turbojet engine with a maximum 15.9 kN (3,600 lbf) thrust.

Its first test flight occurred in September 1948, while the second prototype joined the test program in 1949 with several changes to the design, like increased fuel and ammo capacity, changes to the radio system and a new oxygen system (known as the Yak-30D). In testing, the aircraft achieved its goal of Mach 0.9, being capable of Mach 0.935 in a dive, 40 km/h more than the Yak-25 and 1,000 m more in service ceiling.

Most of the flaws found in the first prototype were rapidly fixed in the Yak-30D, with most of the problems being eradicated. However the MiG-15 proved superior for interception of enemy bombers and it was already in production and the project was cancelled in favour of the further development and improvement of the MiG-15.
