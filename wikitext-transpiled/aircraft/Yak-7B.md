== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The aircraft has a lightweight body and a good engine making it very capable of dealing with any kind of enemy. It has decent manoeuvrability for its battle rating, although not as good as the other Yaks. It is most efficient up to 4,000 m (13,123 ft). It's not recommended to use in a turn fight, but if necessary extending the flaps helps a lot. It can climb well making flying away not so difficult. The Yak-7B can withstand from 10 G to -8 G.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The aircraft can take a few hits in the engine and in the hull. It has 8 mm (0.31 in) of steel on the seat. You can avoid most of the enemy aircraft but stalling this fighter is a death wish. Any [[Bf 110 (Family)|Bf 110]] or the other Boom & Zoom type aircraft will knock your plane out. It's effective to gradually reduce your speed and make circles clockwise to make enemies overshoot.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 20 mm ShVAK cannon, nose-mounted (120 rpg)
* 2 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine guns, nose-mounted (260 rpg left + 140 rpg right = 400 total)

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 50 kg FAB-50sv bombs (100 kg total)
* 6 x ROS-82 rockets
* 6 x RBS-82 rockets

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Yak-7B is a versatile aircraft that can destroy both air or ground targets.

The Yak-7B is not as manoeuvrable as its cousins in the tech tree but is decently competitive. Having a wingman with you can work wonders while flying the Yak-7B given both of you create opportunities for each other. The Yak-7B is not an aircraft that does good away from allies so it's essential that you remain in close proximity with other high-flying aircraft. If targeted actively and being chased, try dragging the enemy to the deck near allies.  

The 20 mm ShVAK cannon and 12.7 mm Berezin UB MG combination is decent and will take down any aircraft with precise bursts. Ammunition count is on the lower side so trigger discipline is necessary. It is best to get close and fire when the Enemy aircraft is in middle of a turn or attempting a zoom climb, Targeting the wings or the cockpit.

The Yak-7B is a decent climber, even without the WEP being available, it can easily climb to ~4,000-4,500 m quickly on 100% engine power without issues. The engine temperature turns yellow rather quickly, but it stays there and does not get any higher. Maintaining altitude is recommended which allows you to dive away if things get difficult mid fight. The turn rate is on the higher side but careful manoeuvring can turn tables easily. 

Steep dives are discouraged because the wings rip very quickly. It is best to either dive doing a shallow spiral or to do split-S if one wants to reduce altitude or lose an enemy. But, even if the wings tend to rip, the Yak is a fair BnZ aircraft and careful speed monitoring can get you kills while diving. The Yak-7B has good response to control inputs and does not feel sluggish.

Ground pounding is possible but is not recommended. The Yak can carry 2 x FAB-50 bombs that can destroy ground targets and rockets.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful engine, even without WEP can climb at decent rate
* Nose-mounted 1 x 20 mm ShVAK & 2 x 12.7 mm UBS machine gun proves a very effective combination
* Capable of using rockets for both air and ground targets

'''Cons:'''

* No WEP, engine temperature readings turn yellow quickly
* Engine underperforms above 4,000 m, making the Yak-7B incapable of intercepting high-altitude bombers
* Worse manoeuvrability compared to all other low-tier Yakovlev fighters
* The wooden airframe can't sustain high compression during dive in high speed, resulting in wing rips above 650 km/h
* Any kind of fire will quickly spread across the plane

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Yakovlev Yak-7 was originally intended as a two-seat trainer version of the [[Yak-1]] fighter plane for the Soviet Air Force and only armed with 1 x 7.62 mm [[ShKAS (7.62 mm)|ShKAS]] MG for gunnery practice. Eventually, engineers at the Yakovlev Design Bureau modified the plane into a single-seat fighter superior to the Yak-1. The plane was armed with a single, propeller-mounted 20 mm [[ShVAK (20 mm)|ShVAK]] autocannon and 2 x ShKAS machine guns in the engine cowling and included armour for the cockpit. The plane was quickly adopted by the air force and production was approved by late 1941. Unfortunately, Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the USSR had already begun and the relocation of factories to the Urals and more pressing needs elsewhere meant only 65 were available at the end of the year. Though it would see service as a fighter and interceptor, the aircraft was more often used as a fighter-bomber due to its ability to carry bombs and rockets for use against the Nazi and Italian ground forces. The Yak-7B would be introduced in 1942 and had a reduced wingspan, improved on-board systems, and an easier-to-produce undercarriage compared to the Yak-7A. Production of the Yak-7B would amount to over 5,000 aircraft produced. It would later see service with Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, which only received 2 Yak-7V planes. The [http://www.cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr/en/normandie-niemen-french-fighters-eastern-front Free French Air Force Normandie-Niemen squadron] would also employ the plane on the Eastern Front, eager to get revenge against the Luftwaffe that had bested them on the home front.

This Soviet single-engine fighter was based on the Yak-7UTI, a tandem-seat advanced trainer based on the Yak-1. The first Yak-7B rolled off the production line at Yakovlev in 1942; the last one was made in 1944.

The Yak-7B's armaments consisted of two 12.7 mm Berezin machine guns and one 20 mm ShVAK cannon. In addition, bombs aboard the plane could be suspended. In all, the plane's manufacturer made more than 5,000 Yak-7Bs.
