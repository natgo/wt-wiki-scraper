== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Yakovlev Yak-9B''' was a modified subvariant of the Yak-9D, which was the third variant of the [[Yak-9 (Family)|Yak-9 fighter aircraft family]]. The Yak-9B was a fighter-bomber configuration of the Yak-9D (factory official designation Yak-9L) with four vertical tube bomb bays aft of the cockpit capable of carrying up to four 100 kg FAB-100 bombs or four PTAB cassettes with 32 1.5 kg bomblets each, though only 200 kg of weapons were normally carried. The Yak-9D was a longer-range variant of the standard Yak-9, with a fuel capacity increase from 440 to 650 litres and a maximum range of 1,400 km. Since the Soviet Army went on the offensive in 1943, covering operational advances from the air required an increased number of fighters. The Yak-9D underwent modifications to produce the Yak-9B, which could carry bombs, but this modification did not result in mass production as the Yak-9B armed with bombs had poor manoeuvrability, limiting its combat effectiveness against other fighters. Furthermore, the lack of bomb-aiming equipment made bomb targeting inaccurate.

Introduced in [[Update 1.53 "Firestorm"]], the Yak-9B is the only Yak fighter aircraft with an internal bomb bay. Players can experience the Yak-9B's unique design of being able to ground strike as well as compete for aerial supremacy against adversaries. This is very useful in ground realistic battle mode. Playstyles are identical to those of other Yak families, with the exception that manoeuvrability is slightly reduced when armed with bombs. It remains on the low-altitude spectrum for best performance, though the engines are slightly more powerful as compared to the [[Yak-1 (Family)|Yak-1 variants]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

The Yak-9B isn't the worst protected aircraft, but it isn't great either. It has some armour protection, and the fuel tanks are self-sealing. Most of the fuel tanks are located in the wings, and one is located beneath the pilot's seat in the fuselage, along with the oil cooler. You can not rely on the survivability of the Yak-9B, although it may save you on a rare occasion.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

{{main|FAB-100sv (100 kg)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* Without load
* 2 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (200 kg total)
* 3 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (300 kg total)
* 4 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (400 kg total)

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

* Low ammunition count, requires accurate firing to damage enemy planes
* Low maximum dive speed
* Performance decreases at altitudes above 3,000 m
* Engine overheats at full throttle
* No WEP in Realistic and Simulator battles

== History ==
An experimental fighter-bomber version of the Yak-9D with four vertical tube bomb bays behind the cockpit. The bomb bay had a capacity of up to 4 x 100 kg (220 lb) FAB-100 bombs or 4 PTAB cassettes with 32 x 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) bomblets each. The typical loadout was 200 kg (440 lb) of bombs.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlev_Yak-9</ref> The Yak-9B was evaluated by the 30th Fighter Division from 18 December 1944 until 20 February 1945, with the trials proving unsuccessful. Bomb release could be achieved at dive angles of less than 45 degrees, but a 400 kg bomb load could not be released this way, which limited the ability to take advantage of the plane's total bomb capacity. Poor handling with a full bomb load and full fuel load, combined with a lack of special aiming equipment, limited the Yak-9B's combat usefulness.<ref>https://airpages.ru/eng/ru/yak9.shtml</ref> The Soviet Air Forces report back to the factory concluded: "Pilots did not want to fly the aircraft. The Chief Designer must redesign the aeroplane." The Yak-9B was not redesigned and never entered full production.<ref>https://www.airvectors.net/avyak1.html#m5</ref>
