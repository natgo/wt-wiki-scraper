== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.33]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The configuration of the Yak-9K's engine is for excellent low altitude performance and manoeuvrability, though, without necessary turbo or superchargers, the aircraft's performance at high altitude suffers. The Immelmann speed of the {{PAGENAME}} is superior to the majority of comparable fighters at the same battle rating making it a capable dogfighter.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Avia-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the aircraft. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->

A {{PAGENAME}} offers good pilot protection, it is unlikely that a pilot snipe should occur. Due to strengthened structure and centralising of the critical components, it is a real possibility for a skilled pilot to clip an enemies plane with a wingtip and remain unscathed, either slicing the enemy's wing or disabling a propeller. Though the {{PAGENAME}} does have self sealing fuel tanks located in the wing, that does not preclude them from catching on fire.

- 8 mm Steel plate in the pilot's seat

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|NS-45 (45 mm)|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- 1 x 45 mm NS-45 cannon, nose-mounted (29 rpg)
- 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, nose-mounted (200 rpg)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

====Engaging fighters & bombers ====
Most enemy fighters will be between 3,000 and 3,800 m, with bombers being around 4,000 to 5,000 m. It's important to use your height advantage, drop down from your height and and get behind the enemy. Once behind the fighter or bomber, do not engage until you are close enough to see their tails in your crosshair. Aim forward and fire only a single shot or a short burst which is no longer than two seconds. If you miss and they turn, pending how sharp the turn is follow them. If it's a very sharp turn do not turn with them, instead open the throttle and climb back up to gain a height advantage. Then either try it again or find a new bandit to knock out.

====Ground & Naval Battles====
In ground and naval battles, the Yak-9K is able to destroy armoured targets with ease. It does not have any secondary armaments such as bombs or rockets. However, its 45 mm cannon is able to destroy heavy tanks. To do this, aim for the roof and dive straight down upon them like an angel that is fighting a demon. In ship combat, the 45 mm cannon is able to penetrate the decks of many heavily armoured ships, but you must aim for roof or sides of the ships. When handling smaller ships such as Patrol boats, do not fly in a straight line. Instead, zip up and down, left to right, then suddenly turn and shoot them. A single well placed shot will destroy their ammo racks and set the ship to visit Davy Jones' locker!

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- The 45 mm cannon is very good at bomber hunting, although climbing to those altitudes takes some time
- 45 mm cannon is good against planes, tanks and boats, thus making the plane a great choice for close air support in ground & naval realistic battles
- 45 mm cannon is able to rip apart any plane with one well-placed shot
- Good climb rate.
- Great low-altitude performance
- Solid manoeuvrability at low altitudes
- Great top speed

'''Cons:'''

- 45 mm cannon is hard to aim due to inaccuracy, especially apparent when stock
- Guns jam relatively quickly, trigger discipline is required
- Secondary weapons have limited ammo, compared to other aircraft

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Yak-9 was a Soviet single-engine fighter of the WWII era. It was the first combat aircraft designed by Alexander Yakovlev's construction bureau. The most mass-produced Soviet fighter of the war, it remained in production from October 1942 to December 1948, with a total of 16,769 built.

The Yak-9 was a further modification of the Yak-1 and Yak-7. In its core design, it was a redesign of the Yak-7. With few external differences, Yak-9 was at the same time much more advanced internally. This is not unexpected, as almost two years of design and combat experience of the Yak series went into the Yak-9. Also, at the time aluminium was in much greater supply than it had been two years previously at the start of the war. Amongst other things, the use of metal allowed the plane's weight to be significantly reduced, meaning that more fuel could be stored and that the aircraft could be equipped with more powerful armament and more specialized equipment.
