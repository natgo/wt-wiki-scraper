== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''Artilleriefährprahm Typ D3''' (or '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''' for short) was a variant of the MF Typ A landing craft converted into a makeshift gunboat after the planned invasion of Great Britain was cancelled. Due to the makeshift conversion plans between shipyards, each AF Typ D landing craft was outfitted with different kinds of armaments and armouring, such as different gun layout and extra concrete coating. The Typ D3, compared to the [[AF D1|Typ D1]], differed in its armament, featuring heavier 10.5 cm cannons instead of the 8.8 cm Flak cannons. In total, around 700 of AF Typ D of all variants were converted, and they were used either as an auxiliary minelayer towed along by destroyers, or used inland as a fire support gunboat.

Introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] in the fleet closed beta test, the '''AF D3''' is essentially the [[AF D1]] equipped with larger 105 mm cannons and slightly different AA armaments. The AF D3 generally performs well as a fire support vessel, as the 105 mm cannons offer a major firepower upgrade over the D1's 88 mm Flak, since it is capable of hull-breaking various PT boats with ease, and even capable of going toe-to-toe against early destroyers. However, being originally designed as a landing craft, the AF D3 is completely lacking in mobility, and struggles to handle multiple enemies at once. As such, positioning and proper support is the key to success in playing this makeshift gunboat.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

Although the armour doesn't cover the whole boat, the survivability is not that bad, as it is a very long boat with lots of empty space inside for shells to go through. It is thus important that enemies with rapid-firing guns do not get too close to the {{PAGENAME}} as they can riddle the entire boat with shells and hit critical components through the armour.

Staying far from the enemies and attacking them with the 10.5 cm guns is the best way to improve the lifespan of the {{PAGENAME}}.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility}}

Like other German naval barges, the {{PAGENAME}} has an abysmal top speed of just 20 km/h (RB) and very sluggish turn time. Due to the long hull design, the {{PAGENAME}} has trouble navigating through various narrow passages and avoiding obstacles and incoming torpedoes.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|SK C/32 (105 mm)}}

The {{PAGENAME}} has two 105 mm SK C/32 turrets as its main armament, which is a direct improvement from the 88 mm FlaK from its predecessor. It has higher explosive mass and penetration, with a fast reload time of just 4.64 seconds. The main gun can fire the following ammo types: HE (effective against most targets), HE with base fuse (effective against armoured targets), and HE-TF (for anti-aircraft purposes). The barges can carry up to 200 shells in total.

{{main|2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 (20 mm)|MG M38(t) (15 mm)}}

The {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with two 20 mm Flakvierling AA guns placed at the bridge and stern each. On the [[SF40 Light]], these guns proved to be very effective against most targets the {{PAGENAME}} might have to face. Due to the gun placement and two fewer gun mounts than the SF40 Leichte, it is somewhat less effective due to less concentrated firepower. However, it is relatively easier to target, as the two gun mount were placed directly frontally and in the rear (as opposed to SF 40 Leichte's diamond placement), this allows the {{PAGENAME}} to hit the target frontally with relative ease.

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|WBD depth charge}}

There are 4 WBD depth charges on the boat. These can be used as a close range weapon, although they only drop behind in your wake.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy.

Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Similar to the [[AF D1]], the {{PAGENAME}} excels in a fire support role. Try to stay at long ranges, where the guns and armour work good together. At close range try to angle or peeking, the downside is you will only be able to use the frontal or rear guns.

Depending on the enemy your face, some weapons on the {{PAGENAME}} might be better than the others. Uses the 105 mm guns is preferred against enemy at long range or a large and/or well-armored vessel to deal high damage, while the 20 mm can be reserved for close-range engagements against faster and more manoeuvrable enemy.

It might be tempting to do a broadside with the {{PAGENAME}}. Be advised, however, that the {{PAGENAME}}'s side armour is flat and became very weak when not angled, coupled with terrible mobility, this made you exposed to all source of incoming fire, including torpedoes.

Players seeking to defeat the {{PAGENAME}} will try to close in from a blind spot or when the {{PAGENAME}} is occupied with other opponents. Use the secondary armaments to deal with these fast-moving boats, as the main 105 mm guns would be too slow to react to new, close-by threats.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 105 mm cannons are very effective against all kinds of targets, with high destructive power and quick reload time
* 20 mm AA cannons are very useful against fast-moving targets and aircraft
* Relatively good survivability when angled correctly
* High crew count

'''Cons:'''

* Terrible top speed and very sluggish to manoeuvre
* Large, slow targets makes it very vulnerable against bombs, torpedoes, and rockets
* In rough sea conditions, the 105 mm cannon's frontal line of fire can be obstructed by the 20 mm mounts
* While thick, the armour is quite flat, thus rendering the barge vulnerable from the boardsides
* Angling armour only allows some guns to be used in combat

The '''Artilleriefährprahm Typ D''' (Artillery Barge Type D) was a modified version of the ''Marinefährprahm Typ A'' (Marine Barge Type A), the largest landing craft class built by the Krigsmarine in World War II. Originally developed in 1941 for Operation Sea Lion, when the plan was cancelled, the barge found its usage in numerous roles it was originally not intended to throughout the war. Over 700 of the barges of various configuration was built.
===AF Typ D===
The AF D was a series of the ''Marinefährprahm Typ A'' modified into a makeship gunboat. The conversion usually varies depending on the shipyard and available materials. Typically, the barge is outfitted with two quadruple 20 mm anti-air cannon mounts, two single 88 mm flak cannons, and one 75 mm anti-air cannon. Although some barge were also outfitted with a 105 mm instead of 88 mm. The helm is moved forward close to the centre of the craft. The craft is often reinforced with armour around the superstructure and ammunition storage, and some have their bulwarks coated with 10 cm of concrete.

The AF D barges were primarily used as an escort and minelayer, towing along by other ships. Although some also found itself inland as an artillery support platform.
