== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (あけぼの, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Daybreak) is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese frigate {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Raining Fire"]].

The Akebono destroyer escort is one of the first domestic ship classes built by Japan after WW2. Very similar to the frigate [[Ikazuchi]], it has more crew and is faster. The Akebono has high survivability owing to its large complement, and its autoloading 76 mm cannons allow for fast destruction of smaller vessels.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Akebono is quite tough, having a large crew of 193 sailors, more than even the reserve destroyers. It can shrug off most fire from smaller ships and even take a good beating from destroyers, though it is not recommended to fight them as they easily outgun you. As with any frigate, torpedoes are a big threat, and just one is usually enough to sink it.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Akebono is quite fast for a frigate, being able to reach 52 km/h in RB, unfortunately that still puts it behind MTBs and destroyers, meaning that it will usually lose a race for a cap zone. It is also rather sluggish at turning, meaning it can be extremely hard to dodge a salvo of torpedoes aimed at it.

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|3-inch Mk.34 (76 mm)}}
The Akebono is armed with 2 x 76 mm guns that both have 360° of rotation, they have a high rate of fire and can fire HE, APHE, and HE-VT shells. the HE can be used to quickly destroy any coastal boat, the APHE to pierce armour and fight larger ships, and HE-VT to destroy planes. The guns unfortunately overheat quickly under sustained fire, and take some time to cool down, meaning that you have to be careful with your shots when fighting groups of ships.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 1 (40 mm)}}
The Akebono is also fitted with a duel 40 mm bofors AA gun at the rear, its high rate of fire can be used to destroy planes or quickly dispatch any boats coming in behind you. It can also be used when you're waiting for your main guns to cool down.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.6 depth charge|Mk.10 Hedgehog mortar|Mk.6 mortar depth charge}}
The Akebono is also armed with a large variety of depth charges, 24 forward-facing Hedgehog Mortars, 20 Mk.6 mortar depth charges, 10 on each side, and 12 mk.6 depth charges dropped from the rear. While these have limited combat value, it can be used to take out a small boat that has gotten a little too close to you.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Akebono is quite a tough ship, at the same BR as the reserve destroyers, it will be facing many smaller vessels that can barely scratch it, while being able to quickly dispatch them with its fast firing 76 mm cannons. It has a large crew that helps it absorb damage, and can even simply sit in a cap zone fighting off any boats that approach it. The biggest threat to the Akebono from these smaller boats are torpedoes, as the sluggish movement can make it hard to dodge a well placed torpedo salvo.

When facing destroyers though, the Akebono starts to suffer, its lack of torpedoes and small calibre guns means that it will always be outgunned, the best strategy to use the fast rate of fire to disable the enemy's weapons, and then either retreat or try to take out the ship piece by piece.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Decent firepower:
** Fast firing 76 mm guns
** Guns have 360° of rotation
** Search and tracking radar allows for easy spotting of enemy targets
** HE-VT shells are effective at swatting planes out of the sky

* Guns overheat rather quickly
* Firepower doesn't hold up against destroyers
* Somewhat sluggish at turning

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Following the end of WWII, Japan was prohibited from having its own military. However, with the advent of the Cold War in the years following the end of WWII, Japan was once again permitted to raise a small force for self-defense purposes. As a result, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed in 1954.

However, the newly formed Navy needed new ships to be able to conduct its tasks effectively and to gain experience for the construction of subsequent ships in the future. As a result, already in 1953 plans were being laid down for the construction of three new destroyer escorts, with two separate designs differing primarily in the propulsion system used. The Akebono, as the single ship of the batch to use traditional steam propulsion, was laid down in December 1954 and was commissioned in March 1956, becoming among the first domestically produced Japanese military vessels to enter service after WWII.

The Akebono served for 20 years with the JMSDF before being decommissioned in 1976. In 1981, the ship was taken apart from scrap and officially stricken from the naval register in 1986.
