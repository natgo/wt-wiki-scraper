== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
Laid down on 27 June 1953, launched on 18 July 1954, and entered into service on 1 June 1955, the '''Albatros F543''' was the first ship of the Albatros-class corvettes to be built. With the role of convoy flanking and anti-submarine search, she was in service from 1955 until October 1962 under the 10th A/S Squadron of the 1st Naval Division. She would only carry out escort missions, submarine search operations, and intercoastal patrols, and in fact, she would be used for Fisheries Surveillance in the Sicilian Channel until June 1983 when she was transferred back to La Spezia, only to be removed from service after 3 years and decommissioned in 1986.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Albatros F543 is a very good corvette thanks to its firepower: the SMP 3 cannons can only equip HE and HE-VT shells, but thanks to its continuous and quick firing without overheating compared to other 76 mm cannons, you can cause a lot of explosive damage and continuous crew loss to enemy vessels. Meanwhile, the 40 mm Breda-Bofors cannons with their rapid fire rate can quickly destroy any small targets. Additionally, the 76 mm are able to be equipped with HE-VT, and the Albatros is equipped with a radar that can lock on to enemy aircraft, so it will be child's play to destroy enemy aircraft.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The survivability of the Albatros F543 is decently able to withstand several enemy hits, the crew consists of 117 people so you have decent survivability against enemy damage to the hull, armaments, and fires on the ship. However, if the ship is under continuous enemy fire, it is not able to respond to enemy fire because many times they will start to shoot down all your armaments first so in the end try to avoid such situations where possible.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
For a frigate, the Albatros F543 is very manoeuvrable and decently fast, which allows it to dodge some enemy fire coming towards your ship and also to dodge any torpedoes or enemy bombs. It can accelerate both forward and backward quickly, but it struggles to slow down, so, in this case, it can help to steer left and right to slow down further.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Focus on unlocking OM-2 HE and OM-2 HE-VT shells after repairs and extinguishers to give you an advantage in firepower against both naval and air targets

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|76 mm/62 SMP 3 (76 mm)}}

The main armament is composed of two 76 mm SMP 3 in single positions, located one in front and one in the back. They do not overheat. The guns can only be loaded with high-explosive shells: OM-1 and OM-2. OM-2 has more explosive filler than OM-1, and these bullets are able to disable any component present in enemy ships from the armament up to the engines thanks to its explosive potential. Always try to disable the enemy armament before any other component.

In contrast, the HE-VT shells are perfect for shooting down enemy air targets from long to short range, and this projectile also has great explosive power with 0.864 kg of explosive so can destroy even a strategic bomber (B-17, He 177, etc) with a single shot.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|L70 Bofors-Breda (40 mm)}}

The secondary armament consisting of a twin 40 mm Breda-Bofors turret is a great secondary for the simple fact that you have a high rate of fire and can use this armament against both coastal ships except those that have high survivability ([[LE Orla]], [[HMS Peacock]]) and in particular very effective against air targets due to rapid fire and the radar which you can use to manually lock on to aircraft and shoot them.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.10 Hedgehog mortar|B TG 100 depth charge}}

The Albatros can also be equipped with two Mk.10 Hedgehog mortars and two B TG 100 depth charge launchers, both of which are submarine-specific armaments but being that they are not in War Thunder, you can use them against both small and large ships, both of which cause severe hull damage, incapacitating the enemy ship and causing it to flood quickly.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

When preparing to use the Albatros F543 in battle, it is advisable to start with another ship or boat, allowing the enemy to approach closer to your spawn. Once the conditions are right, spawn the Albatros F543 (this will usually be at the destroyer spawn since it is a frigate). Engage the enemy vessels using your 76 mm cannons: while stock, you will only have the OM-1, but after researching the OM-2 HE, you will be able to inflict significant damage to enemy ships due to the explosive mass of the shell. Aim your shots at the main guns and then at the bridge to disable the enemy's most lethal armament. Keep an eye on the radar for incoming enemy planes, and use the 40 mm Bofors-Breda to take them down. Alternatively, lock onto the enemy plane and take shots with the 76 mm OM-2 HE-VT to effectively shoot down the plane attacking you or an ally. For air and naval targets, the 40 mm Bofors-Breda can be left in AI mode. Depending on the map, it's recommended to play around a sheltered position for safety to take cover if the main armament gets destroyed.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

=== Albatros-class ===
The Albatros-class consisted of 10 ships built by Italy to give to some NATO nations using American funds to increase the defence capabilities of these nations under the Mutual Defence Assistance Program. All Albatros-class corvettes were originally equipped with two 76 mm SMP 3 cannons placed at the front and rear, a twin 40 mm Breda-Bofors turret at the rear, and a Hedgehog launcher to attack submarines. Later, the various nations would alter the armament to their own configurations.

Of the Albatros-class, 3 corvettes would be built for Italy, 4 corvettes for Denmark (known as the Triton-class), 2 corvettes for Indonesia (heavily modified and slightly enlarged, forming the Pattimura-class), and finally 1 corvette for the Dutch navy.

=== Service history ===
Laid down on 27 June 1953, launched on 18 July 1954 and entered into service on 1 June 1955, the Albatros F543 was the first ship of the Albatros class to be built, to support allied ships in convoy in the role of submarine-destroyer and in defence against enemy small ships, and to patrol the coasts. She was assigned to the 10th A/S Squadron of the 1st Naval Division until October 1962, and on 4 March 1956, she was awarded the combat flag by the ANMI (Associazione Nazionale Marinai d'Italia) Group of Ivrea in Genoa. After active service, she went on to serve as a training ship, carrying out fishing surveillance missions in the Sicilian Channel until June 1983, before being permanently transferred to La Spezia where, in 1986, she was taken out of service and decommissioned.

=== [[wt:en/news/7572-development-albatros-sub-chaser-f-543-sea-shredder-en|Devblog]] ===

In the early 1950s, the Italian Ansaldo shipyard designed a new class of corvettes that subsequently ended up being selected by NATO to equip several member states' navies under the Mutual Defence Assistance Program (MDAP). As a result, Ansaldo initially received orders to construct a total of eight ships, of which three were destined for service in the Italian navy, one with the Dutch and the last four with the Danish navy. Several years after the initial order was placed, Indonesia also expressed interest in procuring the Albatros-class corvette, as it became known, for its own navy and subsequently placed an order for two vessels to be constructed.

The Albatros-class was the first series of warships constructed by Italian shipyards following the end of WWII. Albatros itself was completed and commissioned in 1955, with the remainder of the ships being delivered to their respective operators until 1957. In service, the Albatros corvettes experienced some issues with their primary weapon - the automatic 76mm SMP 3 cannons - being considered too complex. Despite this and the vessels perceived lacklustre speed, Albatros-class corvettes were considered successful and would end up serving up until the early 1990s before the Italian navy finally decommissioned their last vessels from active service.
