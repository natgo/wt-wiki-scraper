== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->Albatros F543 Set up on 27 June 1953, launched on 18 July 1954 and entered into service on 1 June 1955, the Albatros F543 was the first ship of the albatross class to be built, with the role of convoy flanking and anti-submarine search, she was in service from 1955 until October 1962 under the 10th A/S Squadron of the 1st Naval Division, She would only carry out escort missions, submarine search operations and intercoastal patrols, and in fact, she would be used for Fisheries Surveillance in the Sicilian Channel until June 1983 when she was transferred back to La Spezia, only to be removed from service after 3 years and decommissioned in 1986.

In the game Albatros F543 added in the [[Update "Wind of Change"|"Wind of Change" update]], it is a very good corvette thanks to its firepower, the SMP3 have only HE and HEVT as hits but thanks to its rapid-fire without overheating compared to other 76mm SMP3 cannons you can cause a lot of surface damage destroying the enemy ship by explosive damage and continuous crew loss, while your 40mm Breda-Bofors with its rapid-fire can quickly destroy any small targets, and not to forget that both the 76mm and 40mm are equipped with HE-VT and in addition in the ship you are equipped with a radar that can lock on to enemy aircraft so it will be child's play to destroy enemy aircraft.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The survivability of the Albatros F543 is decently able to withstand several enemy hits, the crew consists of 117 people so you have decent survivability against enemy damage to the hull, armaments and fires on the ship, however, if the ship is under continuous enemy fire it is not able to respond to enemy fire because many times they will start to shoot down all your armaments first so in the end it cannot be under continuous enemy fire.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
For a frigate, the Albatros F543 is very manoeuvrable and decently fast, which allows it to dodge some enemy fire coming towards your ship and also to dodge any torpedoes or enemy bombs while speaking of acceleration, it can accelerate both forward and reverse quickly, but it struggles to slow down quickly, so, in this case, you'll have to go left and right to slow down further.

{{NavalMobility}}

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}A little tip is to look for HE OM-2 and HE-VT OM-2 rounds after repairs and extinguishers to give you an advantage in firepower for both naval and air targets

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|76 mm/62 SMP 3 (76 mm)}}

The main armament composed of two 76mm SMP3 in single positions located one in front and one in the back are very good because they do not overheat, you have only explosive bullets and explosives with anti-aircraft fuse, there are two explosive bullets OM-1 and OM-2 the difference is that OM-2 has more explosive potential than the OM-1 and these bullets are able to disable any component present in the enemy ship from the armament up to the engines thanks to its explosive potential, the advice is always to disable the enemy armament before any other component.

In contrast, HE-VTs are perfect for shooting down enemy targets from long to short range, and this projectile also has great explosive power with 0.864 kg of explosive so can destroy even a strategic bomber (B-17, He 177 and so on) with a single shot.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|L70 Bofors-Breda (40 mm)}}

The secondary armament consisting of a twin 40mm Breda-Bofors tower is a great secondary for the simple fact that you have a high rate of fire and can use this armament against both coastal ships except those that have high survivability ([[LE Orla]], [[HMS Peacock]]) and in particular very effective against air targets due to the HE-VT belt selection and the radar which you can use to manually lock on to aircraft and shoot them.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.10 Hedgehog mortar|B TG 100 depth charge}}

The added armament consists of two Mk.10 Hedgehog mortars and two B TG 100 depth charge launchers, both of which are submarine-specific armaments but being that they are not on War Thunder, you will use them against both small and large ships, both of which cause severe hull damage in capacitating the enemy ship and causing it to flood quickly.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Then before using the Albatros F543, use another ship or boat so that as the battle goes on the enemy comes closer to your spawn after being destroyed choose Albatros F543, and spawn in the destroyers spawn for the simple fact that the albatross is a frigate, start to engage enemy ships with your 76mm cannons, from stock you will have the OM-1 but later when you research the HE OM-2 you will be able to cause a lot of damage to enemy ships thanks to the explosive mass of the shot, when you are against enemy ships always aim at the main guns and then at the bridge so you can disable the main armament that is the most lethal, Every now and then look at the radar to see if enemy planes are approaching if you spot one the 40mm Bofors-Breda should easily destroy the air target or lock on to the enemy plane and switch shots with the HE-VT OM-2 so that you can shoot down enemy planes that are attacking you or attacking an ally, the 40mm Breda Bofors can be left in AI mode in air and naval targets, depending on the map I recommend you find a sheltered position for safety so that if they destroy the main armament you can hide and take cover.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Excellent AA Armament
* The main armament does not overheat
* Searching and Track Radar for Air targets

*

'''Cons:'''

* Low Speed and acceleration
* Don't have any AP rounds

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== Albatros-class ===
The Albatross-class consisted of 10 ships built by Italy to give to some NATO nations using American funds to increase the defence capabilities of these nations under the Mutual Defence Assistance Program, eventually, the albatross class corvettes were built, all equipped at the beginning with two 76mm SMP3 placed both front and rear, a twin 40mm Breda-Bofors tower at the rear in the centre of the ship and a hedgehog launcher to attack submarines, later the various nations would change the existing armament to something else.

Of the Albatros-class, 3 corvettes would be built for Italy, 4 corvettes for Denmark but the class would be renamed Triton-class in their case, 2 corvettes for Indonesia but these, in particular, would be modified quite a bit creating the Pattimura-class and is a slightly larger version of the Albatros and finally a corvette for the Dutch navy.

=== Albatros F543 Service History ===
Laid down on 27 June 1953, launched on 18 July 1954 and entered into service on 1 June 1955, the albatross F543 was the first ship of the albatross class to be built, to support allied ships in convoy in the role of destroyer-submarine and in defence against enemy small ships, and to patrol the coasts, in her service history between 1955 until 1986 she was assigned to the 10th A/S Squadron of the 1st Naval Division until October 1962, on 4 March 1956, she was awarded the combat flag by the ANMI (Associazione Nazionale Marinai d'Italia) Group of Ivrea in Genoa, after active service she went on to serve as a training ship, carrying out fishing surveillance missions in the Sicilian Channel until June 1983, before being permanently transferred to La Spezia. where in 1986 she was taken out of service and decommissioned.

'''Devblog History'''

In the early 1950s, the Italian Ansaldo shipyard designed a new class of corvettes that subsequently ended up being selected by NATO to equip several member states' navies under the Mutual Defence Assistance Program (MDAP). As a result, Ansaldo initially received orders to construct a total of eight ships, of which three were destined for service in the Italian navy, one with the Dutch and the last four with the Danish navy. Several years after the initial order was placed, Indonesia also expressed interest in procuring the Albatros-class corvette, as it became known, for its own navy and subsequently placed an order for two vessels to be constructed.

The Albatros-class was the first series of warships constructed by Italian shipyards following the end of WWII. Albatros itself was completed and commissioned in 1955, with the remainder of the ships being delivered to their respective operators until 1957. In service, the Albatros corvettes experienced some issues with their primary weapon - the automatic 76mm SMP 3 cannons - being considered too complex. Despite this and the vessels perceived lacklustre speed, Albatros-class corvettes were considered successful and would end up serving up until the early 1990s before the Italian navy finally decommissioned their last vessels from active service.
