== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German motor torpedo gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Albatros' armour is lacklustre and will be only able to withstand low calibre fire and small amounts of explosive fragmentation. The bridge, hull, and turrets barely have armour, meaning they will quickly be damaged or even destroyed by 12.7 mm or 20 mm armour-piercing rounds. When it comes to components, it is easy to make ammo explosion in the Albatros as the ammunition is above the waterline. When it comes to air threats (machine gun strafes, rockets, bombs), the Albatros will be able to survive them with some exceptions to bombs. Bombs that land within a 40 m radius of the ship can cause fatal damage (it will also depend on the type of bomb, weight, TNT equivalent, etc).

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Albatros, as a Cold War fast attack craft, changes completely the doctrine of previous ships, meaning it compensates armour with speed. It is able to reach speeds above 40 knots (~75 km/h), making it terrifyingly fast for a ship of its with its firepower. It is more than capable of reaching the battlefield faster than other destroyers and will outrun cruisers and battleships. When it comes to manoeuvrability, the Albatros leaves nothing to be desired. It is able to do tight turns (relatively tight turns but with greater speed than other destroyers) as well as accelerate and decelerate quickly.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|76 mm/62 OTO-Melara Compact (76 mm)}}

The Albatros is armed with the powerful OTO-Melara 76 mm Compact autocannon, the same gun as seen in the [[OTOMATIC]]. They are powerful weapons which will decimate almost every vessel it faces, not only because of the calibre but also because the rate of fire, which is doubled as it has two turrets. The autocannons have access to both anti-air and general purpose ammunition, this being HE, HE-VT and SAP. It is recommended to utilize SAP as primary ammunition against everything but aircraft. When it comes to aircraft, HE-VT is recommended due to the proximity fuse. With the use of radar, engaging enemy targets becomes easier than engaging them with eyesight.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
[[File:Type_143_firing_Seal_DM2A1_Torpedoes.png|350px|thumb|{{PAGENAME}} launching its two [[Seal DM2A1 (533 mm)|Seal DM2A1]] torpedoes. Note how they are facing to the rear.]]
{{main|Seal DM2A1 (533 mm)}}

Armament consists of two [[Seal DM2A1 (533 mm)|Seal DM2A1]] torpedoes mounted in tubes on the aft deck. These torpedoes are launched with their tails facing forward. Upon entering the water, they make a tight turn left until coming parallel with the launching ship's original course. They can only be aimed in a forward direction, as the tubes are static.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In Realistic naval battles, the Albatros is a mixed bag. Its high speed makes it great for rushing in to secure capture points and strategic positions at the start of the round. However, the ship lacks in the armour department, and with only 2 main guns, it can get overwhelmed by enemies easily. This ship is best used in a supporting role, where its awesome 76 mm OTO-Melara cannons can shred enemy ships while also benefiting from the extra firepower and protection of friendly craft. In a situation where a player finds themselves alone in the Albatros, it's best to use your speed to head toward friendly forces. It can be good in a one-on-one situation, but as soon as another enemy vessel arrives, the Albatros finds itself at a disadvantage. Torpedoes should be used in rush tactics against larger ships, however it's again advised to do so with support from other vessels. One round from a destroyer or cruiser can badly cripple or even outright sink the Albatros.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good speed to get into great positions before the enemy
* Fast firing 76 mm main armaments that can give even destroyers a run for their money
* Guns are stable at high speeds
* Variable time fuse shells paired with the great guns makes dealing with aircraft easy
* Access to air search and tracking radar

'''Cons:'''

* Lightly armoured
* Small crew size
* Small size means compartments and modules are packed rather tight
* Torpedo tubes are static
* Only two main guns and no secondary armament

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Albatros-class fast attack craft was the replacement ship for the Type 141 Seeadler-class fast attack craft, a derivative of the Type 140 Jaguar fast attack craft. The design and development started in the 1960s and finished design stages in 1966. It was set under production, with the first unit being launched and commissioned in 1976.
