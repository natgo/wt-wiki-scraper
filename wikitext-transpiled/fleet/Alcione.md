== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
'''Alcione''' was the second vessel of the [[Albatros Class (Family)|Albatros-class]] of Italian corvettes, designated PCE 1920 when built, and F 544 on commissioning. Her motto was ''Nihil me deflectit'' ("nothing deflects me"). She entered service on 23 October 1955 and had a rather unremarkable record during the Cold War, which ended with decommissioning in 1991.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced during [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8986-event-earn-alcione-in-the-flight-of-the-albatross-event-en|2024 Flight of the Albatross event]]. She is nearly identical to her sister ship [[Albatros F543]], with the only difference being the use of [[Mk.4 depth charge]]s instead of [[B TG 100 depth charge]]s. She is a very good corvette thanks to her firepower: the SMP 3 cannons can only equip HE and HE-VT shells, but thanks to their continuous and quick firing without overheating compared to other 76 mm cannons, you can cause a lot of explosive damage and continuous crew loss to enemy vessels. Meanwhile, the 40 mm Breda-Bofors cannons with their rapid fire rate can quickly destroy any small targets. Additionally, the 76 mm are able to be equipped with HE-VT and guided by the fire director, which allows locking on targets and easily killing them even at a long range.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

Alcione (Italian for "Kingfisher") became the second in a series of eight small ships that were intended to patrol the coastal zone and hunt submarines. Alcione was laid down at the Navalmeccanica Shipyard in 1953, launched the following year, and put into service in 1955. Like other ships in the series, the main Alcione's main caliber gun was the first Italian 76 mm automatic SMP-3 cannon, and to combat submarines, it was equipped with depth charges and Hedgehog mortars. In 1991, Alcione was scrapped for metal.
