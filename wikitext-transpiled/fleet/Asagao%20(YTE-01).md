== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
Laid down in 1944 as American [[Landing Craft Support (Family)|Landing Craft Support]] ''LCS(L)(3)-9'', Asagao started its career in the Asia-Pacific, delivering supplies to Filipino guerrillas and harassing Japanese targets in the region. With the end of the war, the ship was placed in reserve and renamed ''LSSL-9''. In 1950, ''LSSL-9'' was assigned to France, where she was named RFS ''Hallebarde'' (L-9023), but she returned to the United States by 1955.

However, in 1956, along with a batch of fifty other LSSLs, the vessel was transferred to the Japan Self-Defense Force, where the batch was reclassified as the Yuri-class of patrol ships and the vessel was given a new name: JDS ''Asagao'' (あさがお), after the flower morning glory (family Convolvulaceae). Her service in the JSDF was entirely uneventful, being used as a training vessel before returning back to the US Navy in April 1965. The ship was then leased to South Vietnam in September 1965 as RVNS ''Đoàn Ngọc Tang'' (HQ-228), but with the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, she escaped to the Philippines, where she was loaned to the local government and remained under the name RPS ''La Union'' (LF-50) until her decommissioning in the 1980s.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]]. In combat, she can outgun most motor torpedo boats and other light vessels, while also being a good anti-air platform. However, her low speed and mediocre survivability make her struggle with frigates and other high-BR vessels. She's a relatively large vessel with an unusually low draft, making her able to reach locations more typically accessible to the torpedo boats, with which she also shares spawn points. Her unique feature, compared to the other LCS's, is a rank III modification enabling the use of 120 [[4.5-inch BBR Mk.7|Mk7 barrage rockets]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
'''Pros:'''

* Incredible firepower against other coastal ship types: Anything but heavily armoured gunboats and subchasers can be shredded in very short time.
* Decent anti-air capability due to dedicated AA armament and access to the AA Mk.31 HE-VT shell for the 76 mm secondary gun.
* Large crew count of 65 people allows to survive moderate amount of enemy fire.
* In opposition to the American and Italian counterparts, the Asagao (YTE-01) gets access to 4.5 inch Mk7 barrage rockets.
* Frontal twin configuration of Bofors L/60 Mark 1 autocannons is greatly heightened. This allows to hide large parts of the ship and engage enemies behind cover.

*

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely slow top speed of only 22 km/h - even slower than the American and Italian representatives of this ship class.
** This plus the large size of the Asagao makes evading enemy torpedoes, artillery and gunfire a very difficult task.

* Usually suffers high crew losses during fires on board.
* 4.5 inch Mk7 barrage rockets have fixed forward firing angle and distance of impact: Hitting enemies with these require several salvos and prediction of enemy movements.
