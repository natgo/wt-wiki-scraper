== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet armoured gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game. '''{{PAGENAME}}''' stands for Russian: бронированный Mалый Охотник, ''Bronirovannyj Malyj Okhotnik''; English: Small Armoured Hunter.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The mid-section of the hull and the bridge are the most well armoured places on the BMO, with maximum thickness of 12 mm around the bridge.

The main 37 mm has a 10 mm thick shield protecting it from light enemy fire, whereas the 45 mm can be knocked out very easily, especially by planes. Fires are frequent, but that is due to the nature of early-tier boats, not to any major flaws of the boat.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The BMO can reach 43 km/h in AB and 37 km/h in RB and SB (without Depth Charges). The acceleration is decent, but lighter boats will easily overtake you, so you will rarely reach strategic points first. The BMO can reach reverse speeds of up to -24 km/h (AB).

It turns very well, retaining its mobility even at lower speeds, that is because its rudder reroutes very quickly, comparable to the lightest of boats, such as the G-5. Overall, the BMO is very mobile, but not very fast.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)}}

The 37 mm main armament on the BMO is very powerful in the fact that it is rapid fire and can obliterate small boats with its armour piercing belt rounds. However, anything larger than a submarine-chaser won't take much damage from your calibre of fire, and it is recommended to steer clear or switch to the larger calibre secondary. The ammo capacity is quite unusually large at 500 per belt, with a capacity of 2 belts. You won't be reloading or running out of ammo quickly. The clip reload is unbelievably fast for how much ammo it has, which makes from changing from HE to AP a breeze. It is hard to overheat the weapon, but just keep in mind not to hold down for too long. This weapon can also double as an AA gun with its rate of fire, and manual aim instead of AI would be better, as the AI can overheat the weapon and don't stop when the weapon is overheated or near overheating. The rotation is not as fast as one would expect, but after upgrades, it is snappy and can easily catch speedy patrol boats off guard.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|45 mm/68 21-KM (45 mm)}}

The 45 mm secondary armament on the BMO is slightly more powerful than the primary 37 mm, although it should only be used against the toughest opponents, hence its secondary nature. The rate of fire is slow, so it is advised to use this weapon at longer ranges. However, that also means that you shouldn't worry about ammo running out, and you can keep holding down the fire button, as the weapon doesn't overheat.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

The anti-air armaments consist of a total of four 12.7 mm machine guns (2 x AN-M2; 2 x DShK). These guns should be primarily against the aircraft, but they can also be used against the lightly armoured boats. The guns are positioned in the middle section of the ship, on top of the bridge and on the stern, which should pose no problems against aircraft, because you will be able to get at least 2 guns onto the enemy, but it can be hard to attack boats directly in front of the ship.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|BB-1 depth charge|KB-3 pattern 1940 mine}}

The BMO has the option to carry 8 x BB-1 depth charges. They can be used to surprise flanking opponents or to sink tougher enemies by dropping charges in their path.

''Remember'' that you can set the Depth Charge activation time before spawning in if you carry Depth Charges. You can select to delay the activation time from 3s to 10s. You should find the optimal activation time for yourself, but it is advised to use something in the middle (5-8 s), so that you have a wider range of options when using your depth charges.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The BMO is one of the first Soviet boats that has a large variety of armament. At this stage, you may need to assign new buttons to be able to select your primary/secondary/anti-aircraft armaments, because the BMO works best when all of its weapons are used. Generally, the BMO should be played like a slower Motor Torpedo Boat that can stand its own ground. For example, at the beginning of a match, it can rush a cap point and decimate the oncoming light boats with its 37 mm primary (which is comfortably positioned in the bow). When the cap is clear, the BMO can take on a defensive role behind some cover.

The 45 mm secondary armament should mostly be used against the larger American and German ships (PT-103 / S-100), but you still need to be careful, because those ships can easily take out your guns, and the BMO itself. If you're unsure whether it's best to use the 45 mm or the 37 mm, always go with the 37 mm, because it is much more forgiving.

As for the playstyle, simply use your 37 mm to obliterate any threats coming from the front, and if you're flanked or in a messy fight, switch to your anti-air armaments and continue obliterating everything. The AI gunners can be set to both surface and air threats, but if you are more experienced, you can change them based on the situation (more planes - focus on air threats; in a messy fight - focus on surface threats).

You need to play safer. Don't rush for caps alone, because ships of higher BR can easily sink you. You should flank your enemies where possible and unload your 37 mm (or even the 45 mm) into the exposed sides. The anti-air weaponry will be mostly useless against ships at this BR, so you can just set your AI gunners to air threats and focus on the ships.

Your greatest enemy in this BR is large sub chasers (SC-497) and other BMOs. When facing these, take out the primary armaments with your 37 mm, as this is the effective, more than forgiving weapon to do so and then start shooting the ammo racks or critical modules and try to have a teammate with larger guns than you (a Soviet armoured gunboat is a perfect companion to pair up with as both have very similar speeds) to take the compartments, as you don't have the time to take on all compartments with such a small calibre gun. It is recommended to load AP clips, as these are very suitable for turret busting.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great variety of armaments, which should be used interchangeably to increase your chances of escaping difficult situations
* A lot of ammunition
* Decent speed

'''Cons:'''

* Negligible armour on the armaments, making them very easy to knock out
* No torpedoes
* The 37 mm primary armament can overheat (and the AI gunners always overheat the weapon when the player is using another one)
* 45 mm O-240 HE shells are very slow (only 343 m/s) compared to the up to 835 m/s of other shells

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The BMO, produced from 1943-45 in Leningrad, was the final and most advanced iteration of the MO class of ships. Originally designed for anti-sub operations, the MO series also filled a multitude of roles including mine laying and sweeping, escorting convoys, and supporting amphibious landings. The BMO was the most versatile of the line due to the addition of armour as well as the replacement of one of the 45 mm guns with a much faster firing 37 mm gun to better deal with aircraft. A total of 66 BMOs were produced.
