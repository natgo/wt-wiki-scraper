== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (lit. "Noble") was a [[Pr.56 (Family)|Project 56 (Kotlin-class)]] destroyer, which were the last gun-only destroyers built for the Soviet Navy. The Project 56 destroyers were improved, scaled down, and modified versions of the previous experimental Project 41 [[Neustrashimy]] destroyer, better suited for large scale production as they were smaller, cheaper, and easier to build in large quantities. Blagorodnyy was laid down on 5th March 1955 and commissioned on 30th June 1957. From 30th June 1957, she was part of the Black Sea Fleet where she participated in various exercises and training duties. In 1963, Blagorodnyy underwent modernization to PLO standard which meant strengthening of anti-submarine capabilities by installing four anti-submarine rocket launchers with two astern and two in front of the bridge as well as replacing the older radars for newer types. Between 1973 and 1976 when the ship was undergoing repairs, one of the torpedo launchers was removed and a deckhouse together with two twin 25 mm 2M-3 automatic cannons was installed in its place. On 21st March 1980, while performing combat duty in the Mediterranean, Blagorodnyy collided with hydrographic research vessel Memory of Mercury. Blagorodnyy was decommissioned on 25th April 1989 and sold for scrap in 1992.

Blagorodnyy was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]] as a GE premium. She is a modified version of the previous Neustrashimy-class destroyer, sharing the same hull design, magazine locations, as well as the air track and search radar Fut-N. The secondary 45 mm guns are split into one behind each main armament turrets and two between funnels on each side of hull, unlike two behind each main armament turrets on Neustrashimy. She is depicted in her 1978 configuration, with strengthened anti-submarine capabilities and additional anti-aircraft armaments. The Blagorodnyy's propulsion is divided into two sections with boilers and transmission paired under each funnel, so direct hit into one section does not leave the ship dead in the water.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The design of Project 56 destroyers are identical: in Blagorodnyy's case, it is the "PLO" ASW variant of the family. Both the hull and superstructure are made of steel at 16 mm and 4 mm respectively. While it is sufficient to stop lower calibre autocannons without any AP shell, the secondary cannons of ships at this BR will very like penetrate the hull, even HE shells. Like most destroyers at its rank, the ammo storage is right below the turrets and both 130 mm and 45 mm ammunition stored closely, the abundance of ammo will very likely result in a detonation or total destruction if either one is ignited.

In case of extra protection, parts of the ship are covered mostly by anti-shrapnel armour of 10 mm thickness by the funnel, torpedo control room, face of SM-20-ZIF, etc., with some area at higher or lower thickness. While this is nowhere sufficient from direct hits, it can at least save the ship from shrapnel of near-misses.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Thanks to the 4 GTZA TV-8 steam turbine engines onboard, the Blagorodnyy can push up to 72 km/h (38.9 kn). The speed itself is very sufficient for it to leave the heated combat zone or flanking enemies with relative ease.

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|130 mm/58 SM-2-1 (130 mm)}}

A common feature of Soviet destroyers is their 130 mm turrets. In Blagorodnyy's case, it is armed with 2 x SM-2-1 130 mm dual mount on the front and rear of the hull. Thanks to the advancement of technology, it has a faster traverse speed than the B-2LM mounts of previous destroyers and let alone the single B-13 mounts. The new SAP and HE-VT shell also prove its capability to take down enemy vessels up to light cruisers given the shots does extensive damage against their internal modules. The 130 mm SM-2-1 turrets are equipped with ZF-42R HE-VT shells, the sheer calibre of the gun is more than enough to scare off enemies' planes even at longer ranges or higher altitude thanks to its anti-aircraft radar onboard with leading indicator. If any aircraft comes within its explosion radius, it is very unlikely that it can survive the salvoes.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|45 mm/89 SM-20-ZIF (45 mm)}}

Most destroyers at this rank have extensive medium calibre anti-aircraft firepower against incoming planes and the Blagorodnyy is among the very last gun destroyers of Soviet Navy. The 4 x quad mount 45 mm SM-20-ZIF mount onboard have an extremely devastating firepower against planes or coastal ships within their range.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2M-3 (25 mm)}}
Aside from 45 mm quad mount autocannons onboard, the Blagorodnyy also sports 2 x twin mount 2M-3 25 mm autocannons. Like the other type of autocannon onboard, any aircraft and coastal ship will have a very bad day when being strafed a few seconds by it.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-57 (533 mm)|RBU-2500|RKU-36U mortar}}

The base model Project 56 didn't have sufficient deterrence against submarines. With the Blagorodnyy's PLO upgrade, a pair of RBU-2500 depth charges respectively at the front and a pair of RBU-36U at the rear were added. While there aren't submarines in-game currently, the explosive content of those rockets can take out PT boats or fast attack boats right away, alternatively set enemy vessels ablaze or knock-out their critical modules. The  range for the bow mount is up to 2,500m and only 250 m for the stern mounts.

The other weaponry on-board are its quintuple 533 mm 53-57 torpedo launchers located by the middle of the ship. They inflict sufficient damage against careless targets, but remember to set torpedo depth for maximum damage.
