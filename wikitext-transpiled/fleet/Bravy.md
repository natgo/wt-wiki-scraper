== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Бравый; Brave, hull number 650) was one of the Project 56 Spokoinyy (Спокойный, "tranquil") Class Destroyers with Bravy being the 56K variant with enhanced air-defence capabilities; starting in 1962, the vessel was fitted with anti-air missiles, though it was only for testing and this particular refit was never extended to any other vessels of the class. The ship was built in Mykolaiv/Nikolayev Shipyard in 1952 and joined Soviet Navy in January 1956 as one of the ships in the VMF's Black Sea Fleet. The ship was famous for having an accidental collision with the Royal Navy's Ark Royal in November 1970 with casualties onboard Bravy. The ship was later stored in Sevastopol as part of the "mothball fleet" (reserve fleet) and eventually broken up for scrap in 1987. 

The Bravy was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]] as the first Soviet ship to receive SAM for air-defence and the first bluewater vessel with guided missiles, although the installation of the Volna-M (Волна, "''wave"'') came at the cost of removing a main turret and AA mounts at the aft, as well as the vessel having a relatively slower top speed than other ships of her class. Bravy is now a fearsome, anti-aircraft destroyer which can blow aerial targets into pieces with its varieties of weapons on board; either by the traditional guns or the latest SAMs of its era.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Although still being one of the family of Project 56 Destroyers and sharing mostly identical protection, Bravy has some distinctive features to other ships of its class. The most noticeable difference is the rear superstructure housing the Volna-M (Wave-M) SAM systems and its carousel autoloader, giving it the suffix K in its project number. Due to the system occupying where the aft turret once was, Bravy now only has one SM-2-1 twin 130 mm turret at the bow; the rearranged superstructure also removed the aft quad 45 mm autocannon and now only has 3 turrets of such onboard, and only one quintuple torpedo launcher. At such, Bravy has overall inferior firepower to other ships of its class, though the addition of the RBU-2500 mortars give the ship an ace card at extreme close range. Be extra careful to evade oncoming shots, due to the cramped spaces at the bow with abundance of ammunitions. 

Although the large missile carousel is mostly over the waterline and you would assume it to be a huge weak spot, it is surprisingly resilient to detonation. The ship may frequently see inbound fire striking the aft of the ship and not causing any missiles to explode.

Like other Project 56s, the turrets, bridge and funnel are covered by anti-shrapnel armour ranging from 6-10 mm thickness; it is nowhere sufficient to stop direct shots from enemy ships, but at least it will give the Bravy some chance to survive shrapnel from enemy HE shells.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Same as other Project 56s, the ship is propelled by 4 GTZA TV-8 steam turbine engines; but due to the new systems and extra superstructure onboard, it has the slowest speed among all the other ships of its class maxed out at only 65 km/h.

{{main|130 mm/58 SM-2-1 (130 mm)}}

All Project 56 destroyers has identical main weapon: the 130mm SM-2-1 twin mount turret and Bravy is no exception; but the problem is that the addition of the Volna-M launch has occupied the aft turret, thus Bravy only has one bow turret. The overall firepower is still sufficient to take down light vessels such as destroyers and lightly protected cruisers, though not as efficiently as the regular Pr.56. It is recommended to aim at magazines of enemy vessels, as the 130mm is great at poking into them and causing catastrophic detonations, which is a much more efficient way to destroy a vessel than wearing down the crew, though it can only really be done reliably at closer ranges. The main turret is also a decent tool in the role of air defence with its VT shells. Do remember to keep the turret operational at all times as the remaining autocannons or SAM are not reliable enough to take on other destroyers.

{{main|Volna-M}}

The Volna-M missile launcher is the main feature of this ship and places the vehicle in the rare category of a missile-armed warship, of which there are only two other ships in the game, both coastal vessels.

The launcher carries two 379 mm two-stage V-600P anti-air missiles at a time, with the total number of missiles on the craft at 18. Once both missiles are fired, the launcher requires a minimum of 50 seconds (ace crew) to reload. Though designed for anti-air work, the missiles can be used against surface targets with mixed results. The missiles can detonate a number of destroyers and, on rare occasions, cruisers if they strike a magazine, but this requires pinpoint aim, a good knowledge of weak spots of various ships and a fair degree of luck. If a magazine is not struck, the missiles will still do decent damage to destroyers, taking out a number of crew and modules, and potentially starting moderate to severe flooding, but will usually not be enough to destroy the vessel on its own. Cruisers with light protection are even more resilient to the missiles and against cruisers with any reasonable degree of armour, you may as well not even try. 
[[File:Aganoexplosion.png|thumb|408x408px|The light cruiser IJN Agano in the process of detonating moments after a carefully aimed V-600P hit the waterline below the forwardmost turret. ]]
A very important thing to note about the V-600P is that the missiles can be triggered by any munition (other than low calibre bullets) that passes through its trigger radius. If any stray shells, bombs, rockets or anything of the sort get too close to the missile in flight, it will trigger the warhead and prematurely detonate the missile. It can even be triggered by flying over a torpedo. This has a significant reduction in the reliability of the missile as they can often be seen exploding seemingly at random before hitting the target. Although, this is only really an issue when aiming at surface targets, given the density of fire flying just above the waves. Against air targets, well above the shells being spewed by each team, this occurrence is rare enough not to really worry about. 

One of the most noticeable things about the missiles is that they tend to twirl and curve through the air quite substantially rather than flying straight, especially just after launch. The missile attempts to home towards the direction that the player is aiming, however the player's viewpoint is placed in the bridge of the vessel when looking through the binoculars, near the front of the ship, while the launcher is towards the back of the vessel, so the missile darts sideways toward the player's centre of vision right after launch before stabilising itself. Although not too much of a problem most of the time, it can sometimes result in the missile splashing into the water after trying to swing into the centre of vision, as well as making aiming at closer ranger targets more finicky. It's near impossible to hit an air target within 2km. This effect can be reduced by angling the ship and reducing the horizontal distance between the launcher and the player's viewpoint, which can limit the amount the missile swings off to the side and enables the missile to stabilise faster.
[[File:V-600P side view.png|thumb|406x406px|The V-600P moments after being launched. The physical gap in the two-stage system is clearly visible.]]

As for the missile curving and twisting through the air midway toward the target, this is because the missile is rather sensitive to the targets movement and is constantly correcting itself, occasionally overdoing it and causing the missile to spiral. This hardly happens against surface targets as ships move slowly and on a flat plane, however firing at aircraft will almost certainly result in some spirals. However, despite careening through the sky almost wildly, the missile is still fairly accurate against aircraft and will almost certainly end up scoring a hit against a propeller-driven plane that doesn't evade out of the way. Though they can only be met in Custom Battles, the missiles are of debatable usefulness against high tier jet aircraft, which are often fast enough that the missile cannot lead far ahead enough of the target and misses. 

Against air targets, the missiles have two targeting modes. The default mode is 'chase', where the missile just flies directly toward where the player is aiming. With aircraft typically flying at a relatively high speed, this often results in the missile detonating more towards the rear end of the plane which, due to the large trigger radius of 40 metres, and means that the aircraft may get away with only splinter damage, though the chase mode can still work well when aimed at an aircraft flying straight toward the player. With a warhead of over 40 kg worth of TNT, the missile is essentially the equivalent of a guided proximity-fused battleship-calibre HE shell, however the 40m radius is very large, even for the heavy warhead. If the missile triggers anywhere in the rear hemisphere of an aircraft, it's not uncommon for the plane to not be destroyed in one hit. Though usually inferior at dealing lethal damage to aircraft, an important aspect of chase mode is that it is completely immune to any chaff the aircraft might have and does not require the radar to even be turned on, only requiring that the player has a line of sight with the opposing plane. Although it's possible for the player to manually lead the target in this mode rather than having the missile follow the target, it can be easy to miss and requires some practice to be a reliable tactic. 

The second mode is 'intercept', which the missile automatically sets to when a radar lock is achieved on the aircraft. In this mode, the missile does not fly directly where the player is pointing, but compensates for the speed of the aircraft by flying ahead of it on an intercept course, which will result in the missile detonating right in front of the plane, which will fly right through the spray of shrapnel and should result in the destruction of even the heaviest of bombers. Although better at dealing damage to an aircraft than chase mode, should the ship lose the radar lock on the plane for whatever reason, such as the radar being knocked out, the missile will switch from intercept to chase mode and this can result in it missing the target. 
[[File:Bomberboom.png|thumb|468x468px|An inbound bomber detonated by a Bravy. To the rear of the explosion, there's distant debris & parachutes visible from a second destroyed bomber, struck by the same Bravy several seconds earlier. ]]
Though the specific speed isn't stated in the game, the missile is visibly faster than any other ship-launched guided missiles currently in game, likely having a maximum top speed of roughly Mach 3.5, compared to the Mach 1.88 of the Saetta's Nettuno and the Mach 1.8 of the USS Douglas' RIM-24A. Not only is it faster than the other missiles, but at 16 km it has the longest range, beating out the 14 km of the  RIM-24A and the 10 km of the Nettuno. This essentially means that in regular matches, it's unlikely to ever see a plane that is not within striking range of the Bravy and if the ship is taken into EC matches, it will have a definitive edge over the Saetta or Douglas in anti-air range, which can be quite useful for keeping the skies clear in the huge 64 km x 64 km maps seen in EC.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|45 mm/89 SM-20-ZIF (45 mm)}}

The Project 56K design also brings revisions the placement of AA autocannons, Bravy now only has 3 instead of 4 SM-20-ZIF quad mount 45 mm autocannons, though they remain effective tools against aircraft and coastal vessels. 

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-65 (533 mm)|RBU-2500}}

The revised superstructure has removed a set of quintuple 533 mm torpedo tubes, leaving the ship with only has 5 torpedoes; depending on the designated targets' size and draft, adjust the depth of torpedoes accordingly for maximum damage.

An interesting addition to the craft are the RBU-2500 mortars, which enables the player to hurl dozens of explosive charges against targets, but only at very close range. Though the aiming can take time to get used to, the mortars can be truly lethal in ideal circumstances. Each shot carries 26kg worth of TNT, roughly equivalent to a low yield battleship calibre HE shell, and they can be fired in very rapid succession. Destroyers will be annihilated and even cruisers will crumble under their explosive power, subjected to raging fires, heavy flooding and any module not protected by a major armour plate or buried deep in the ship being smashed up.
