'''Bretagne''' was a French super-dreadnought, lead ship of [[Bretagne (Family)|her class]], launched in April 1913. Due to the constraints of the French shipyards, her length and displacement remained almost unchanged compared to her predecessors of the [[Courbet (Family)|Courbet class]]. During World War One, she was delegated to blockading the deployment of German and Austro-Hungarian submarines. During the interwar period, Bretagne underwent several very extensive modernizations, including updating fire control systems, replacing an outdated mast with a tripod, and strengthening anti-air defence.

With the outbreak of World War Two, the battleship was based in Toulon and participated in the naval blockade of Germany. In March 1940, she transported part of France's gold reserves to Halifax. At the time of the Invasion of France, she was stationed in Mers-el-Kébir. After the surrender of France, the British command decided to launch an attack on Mers-el-Kebir in order to prevent French ships from falling into German hands. On July 3, during Operation Catapult, the fleet stationed in harbour came under fire from the battleships HMS Valiant and HMS Resolution and the battlecruiser [[HMS Hood]] along with escort vessels. Bretagne received several hits from 381 mm shells, leading to an explosion and sinking which killed 1,012 crew members. In 1942, attempts were made to raise the battleship's hull for cutting, but they were stopped after an explosion occurred on board. In 1952, the hull was finally raised and by 1954 cut for scrap.

The Bretagne was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]] in her 1925 refit. She plays like a typical WW1-era dreadnought, being best used in a second line, picking off targets with her multiple large-calibre guns. Her mediocre armour, little mobility, and next to no anti-air defenses make it difficult for her to compete for capture points or slug out against vessels at higher BRs.

By 1910, the previously competitive French Navy was considerably behind major naval powers such as Britain, Germany & the USA in terms of capital ships, having not yet laid down a single dreadnought type warship whilst the Kaiserliche Marine had built 8 dreadnoughts and a battlecruiser, the United States Navy had built 6 dreadnoughts and the Royal Navy had built 10 dreadnoughts and 5 battlecruisers, and that's ignoring the additional capital ships the nations also had under construction at the time. Even the Imperial Russian Navy had four of its first dreadnought class under construction at the time and Brazil owned two dreadnoughts which Britain had finished construction of that same year. It was only in late 1910 that the first of the 4 French Courbet class dreadnoughts had been laid down, meanwhile other major powers were continually producing and planning yet more capital ships.

In an attempt to reverse France's current naval inferiority, the government authorised an ambitious naval program in March 1912, calling for a force of 28 modern battleships to be completed within the next 8 years, starting with the new Bretagne class of 3 super-dreadnoughts, all laid down that same year.
[[File:BretagneClassProvence.jpg|thumb|<small>Provence, of the Bretagne class, sailing during the First World War</small>]]

To compete with the designs of contemporary battleships, the Bretagne class required 340 mm guns over the prior 305 mm of the Courbet class, but within a hull based on that of the Courbet so that it would still fit France's limited dockyards, necessitating 5 turrets rather than the 6 of the Courbet. However, the Bretagne placed all of its main turrets on the centreline, retaining the 10 gun broadside of the Courbet, which used two wing-turrets.

The three ships of the class were completed just prior to the outbreak of the First World War, though a fourth ship ordered by Greece was never completed. The ships spent the majority of the war in port while guarding the Adriatic from potential Austro-Hungarian incursions, as well as being used to intimidate Greece, which was leaning toward supporting Germany. Through  the interwar years, the three ships received sporadic refits and conducted training cruises. During the Spanish Civil War, Bretagne & Provence joined non-intervention patrols off the Spanish coast.

Following the start of the Second World War, the ships initially didn't see any action outside of escorting several convoys. However, after the Fall of France, Force H of the Royal Navy accosted the majority of the French Navy in the harbour of Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940, delivering an ultimatum which suggested various ways for the French fleet to be interned by or integrated with the Royal Navy to prevent the Axis from having any chance of seizing the ships and overwhelming the British Mediterranean Fleet. Failure to comply with the ultimatum would result in Force H attempting to destroy the French Fleet in the port, which included Bretagne and Provence.

After several hours of negotiations, no agreement was reached and the warships of Force H initiated hostilities upon the French fleet. Within minutes, Bretagne was struck by two 381 mm shells from the third salvo of HMS Hood, HMS Resolution & HMS Valiant, one blasting a hole in the hull with a fiery explosion, causing flooding, and the other destroying the centre engine room. 7 minutes later, another two 381 mm shells hit, which was shortly followed by a catastrophic ammunition detonation that rocked the ship, causing it to roll over and sink. Meanwhile, Provence had begun returning fire on Force H about 90 seconds after the British opened fire, but scored no hits and was then subsequently hit by several 381 mm shells, igniting blazing fires onboard and tearing open the hull, allowing vast quantities of water to flood in, eventually sinking the ship to the bottom of the harbour.

Following the attack, though Bretagne was a lost cause, Provence was raised from the seabed. The ship was somewhat repaired and transferred to Toulon, where it stayed until being scuttled in 1942 to keep the Germans from using it.

Meanwhile, whilst all that had been going on, Lorraine had been interned in Alexandria since the Fall of France. In 1942, the crew of the ship decided to join the navy of Free France and the ship served as a training vessel though 1943. The ship then received a major refit before participating in Operation Dragoon of 1944 as an artillery support ship during the landings. The last action of the ship during war was the bombardment of German forts in northern France in March 1945.

Following the war, the Lorraine became a gunnery training ship and then a barracks ship before being decommissioned in 1953 and sold to scrappers. What was left of Bretagne was raised and scrapped in 1952, while the hulk of Provence was raised and scrapped in 1949.
