== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German motor torpedo gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Red Skies"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7267-event-summer-landing-en|2021 Summer Landing]] event.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The survivability of the Bussard is abysmal. Even with its crew count higher than PT boats', the vessel is completely unprotected by any kind of armour and any gunfire will make short work of her crew and internal compartments. The crew is large at 40 sailors, but they are quickly taken out by gunfire.

The turrets and ammunition magazine are relatively compact, so ammo detonations are possible but not extremely common. The secondary armament, four machine guns above the bridge, is very small and hard to hit. The bridge and the engine compartment are very large targets and are often the first things destroyed when taking fire. 

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The ship is powered by four MTU 16V 956 TB91 diesels, each producing 17,700 shaft horsepower. This gives the Bussard a very good speed for its size, and provides quick manoeuvring at any speed. The vessel can reach a forward speed of slightly over 41 knots spaded, and has a very respectable 22 knot reverse speed. The ship isn't as good as other coastal craft at stopping from full speed, but it is enough to avoid constantly crashing into islands on heavily clustered maps. The rudder shifting is very responsive, taking around five seconds to go completely from one side to the other.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|76 mm/62 OTO-Melara Compact (76 mm)}}

The two fast-firing [[76 mm/62 OTO-Melara Compact (76 mm)]] guns are hard-hitting and have access to some excellent ammunition: a very effective HE shell and a HE-VT shell that easily shreds incoming aircraft.

The reload time of the weapons is fixed at 0.9 seconds with the installed autoloader, with a ready-use ammo supply of 85 rounds per gun. The ballistics are excellent at close to medium range, but at long range begins to suffer given the small calibre of the weapons.

Against enemy ships, the HE shell is the obvious choice. A very potent explosive mass will shred other coastal vessels and can start fires on larger ships.

Against enemy aircraft and to a lesser extent small vessels, the HE-VT shells are very effective. Enemy aircraft nearby will not last long against the quick-firing proximity shells, and smaller vessels are susceptible to them as they act like normal HE against surface targets.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)|MG3 (7.62 mm)}}

The secondary armament is very lacklustre, but is still capable of doing some damage. Two [[AN-M2 (12.7 mm)]] heavy machine guns and two [[MG3 (7.62 mm)]] light machine guns, one of each on the port and starboard sides of the bridge, provide limited defence against other coastal craft and nearby aircraft.

The .50 cal weapons come stock with a Universal belt, and you can unlock an AP and API-T belt with higher portions of Incendiary and Armour-Piercing rounds.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Seal DM2A1 (533 mm)}}

The Bussard also has access to two [[Seal DM2A1 (533 mm)|533 mm Seal DM2A1]] torpedoes on the rear deck. The torpedoes launch backwards and quickly turn around before continuing on their course. The weapons have a very long range and good speed, and while the warhead is mediocre at 250 kg of explosive mass, it is still effective against light craft and destroyers.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Bussard is best used as a second-line ship, supporting faster or more manoeuvrable vessels with its powerful main armament. She relies on nearby allies since her hull is very weak and at the same time represents a large target. It can also be an effective anti-aircraft escort for friendly vessels with its fast-firing proximity rounds, air search radar, and air target tracking radar that can lock onto enemy aircraft and provide a lead indicator.

Everything in the game is a major threat to this ship, given its large size and easily damaged internal modules. Vessels such as the American PT boats with their large-calibre 20 mm and 40 mm cannons are top priority, with any coastal craft or destroyer it can face being a danger.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Large-calibre, fast-firing main guns.
* Effective ammunition choices.
* Very good speed and manoeuvrability for her size.
* Air search and tracking radar.

'''Cons:'''

* Large target and no armour, gets destroyed very easily.
* Only two primary weapons, one being destroyed, heavily impacts damage potential.
* Secondary/AA armament is extremely lacking.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In 1972, the AEG-Telefunken company received an order for the construction of 10 boats in the Albatros project (Type 143), developed by the shipbuilding company LÃ¼rssen. These boats were supposed to replace the outdated ships of Projects 141 and 142. The main calibre of the boats were the Italian automatic 76 mm cannons manufactured by OTO Melara, in addition, there were two SEAL DM2A1 torpedoes on board. The last boat of the series was built in 1977, the lead ship, Albatros, like the rest of the boats, received "bird" names. The fourth boat of the series, Bussard (German for "buzzard") was in service with the German fleet until 2005, and in 2010 was sold to Ghana, where she was renamed to Yaa Asantewaa, in honour of the leader of the uprising and the nation's heroine.
