== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''Chacal''' was a French contre-torpilleur of the [[Jaguar (Destroyer) (Family)|Jaguar class]], launched as the second vessel of her class in September 1924. Her first assignment after the commissioning was as a show-the-flag mission to Finland for the Hanko Regatta and then through Baltic ports, which was later followed by further missions of the same character through various locations. In 1932, she was reassigned to the role of the training ship based in Salins d'Hyères and later Brest. With the beginning of World War Two, she escorted 21 convoys between Brest, Gibraltar, Casablanca, and Le Verdon, notably with her spotters rescuing Bourrasque-class destroyer Mistral on 28 October 1939 from being hit by a torpedo. In the night of 22 May 1940, she carried demolition teams to the port of Calais, followed by providing fire support in defence of Boulogne-sur-Mer until the night of 23-24 May. On that night she was hit by four bombs from [[He 111 (Family)|He 111s]] which started numerous fires, making her an obvious target for the German artillery, which lit her up. She was beached between the nearby villages of Wimereux and Ambleteuse and abandoned. Her wreck survives to this day, being submerged only 2 metres below the surface around 600 metres from the shore.

The Chacal is a French destroyer introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]]. She has an excellent combination of great firepower and high mobility with a decent survivability for the BR, lacking any particular weak points. That said, she is a small vessel compared to most of her counterparts, making it best to avoid taking damage, and using powerful main guns to cripple enemy vessels before they do substantial damage. Similarly, enemy aircraft should be avoided at all cost, as she lacks any short-range anti-air guns. She is best played in a support role or as an ambusher, picking off lone targets and being the one to make the first, crippling salvo. Her gameplay highly rewards gunnery and positioning skills, but this also makes her a very difficult ship to handle for inexperienced players.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

As with most destroyers of this tier, the Chacal lacks any meaningful protection, relying primarily on its mobility for protection. The Chacal has a fairly large crew complement for a ship of its tonnage, granting it a great deal of longevity in combat. The engines and funnels are located in the usual location, amidships, with their only protection being the surrounding fuel tanks. The only armour mounted on the Chacal are the 10 mm thick gun shields mounted on the main guns.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Chacal has a high top speed for its tier, reaching 66 km/h (35.6 kn) when maxed out, allowing it to outrun most ships. The Chacal also has a tight turning circle due to its relatively low tonnage and large rudder, which is further improved with the Rudder Replacement modification.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

As with all naval vessels, Tool Set and Fire Protection System are the top priority. It's personal preference for what modifications to research after these, but it is recommended to research the SAPBC rounds, followed by the mobility upgrades.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|130 mm/40 model 1919 (130 mm)}}

The Chacal features a heavy array of firepower for its size, featuring 5 x 130 mm guns, combining an average rate of fire with extremely deadly ammunition. The firing angles of the forward mounted guns are quite high, however, the two guns in the rear have rather poor angles. The gun mounted amidships has average firing angles. The SAPBC rounds can easily penetrate and destroy modules of enemy destroyers, or at the very least, set the ship on fire. The HE rounds have a high amount of explosive mass, allowing them to easily set a ship on fire, damage deck mounted equipment, disable the rudder of a vessel, and strip the enemy vessel of crew. The main guns have an effective firing distance between 0.5-7 km, any further than that and the shells lose a lot of effectiveness. If a coastal vessel wanders too close, the 130 mm guns will not be able to depress enough to engage it, and the Chacal will have to rely solely on its secondary weapons.

Both ammunition types for the 130 mm guns have a muzzle velocity of 725 m/s, which is subpar compared to contemporary vessels. This makes engagements at longer rangers favour the enemy more, as their rounds travel down range faster. The O.E.A Mle.32 HE rounds have a very high TNT equivalence, sitting at 3.96 kg. The O.P.F.A Mle.23 SAPBC rounds lose 2 kg of TNT equivalence, but gains a significant amount of penetration and a fuse.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|75 mm/50 model 1922 (75 mm)}}

The Chacal only has two 75 mm guns, providing limited firepower against enemy vessels. They provide no effective anti-aircraft firepower, and due to the low number of guns, make them next to useless when engaging multiple enemies. However, the 75 mm guns are decent at engaging enemy coastal vessels, while allowing them to set the deck of a destroyer on fire, or disable its guns.

The 75 mm guns fire their rounds at 850 m/s, allowing these weapons to easily engage targets at longer ranges. The O.E.A Mle.25 HE round have 450 g of explosive mass, which is more than capable of destroying most coastal vessels in a couple of hits. The O.E.A(FT.) Mle.25 round is a time-fused, having the same explosive mass as the standard HE round. It is not recommended to use this round, as the lack of other secondary weapons necessitates using these guns solely for targeting enemy vessels.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Model 1923DT (550 mm)}}

The Chacal mounts 2 x triple tube 550 mm torpedo launchers, allowing it to fire a devastating short or long range barrage of torpedoes. The firing angles of the torpedo launchers are quite generous compared to other French destroyers, however, they are sub-par compared to some contemporary vessels. Without the Torpedo Mode modification, the 550 mm torpedoes are devastating at short to medium ranges, as they are fairly mobile torpedoes. With the modification installed, the torpedoes become lethal long range weapons, allowing it to destroy enemy vessels outside of the effective firing range of the main guns. As with other French destroyers, the torpedoes on the Chacal have a large amount of explosive mass compared to most other nations, with the exception of Japanese torpedoes. This allows the Chacal to destroy most vessels it comes across with only 1 or 2 torpedoes.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
[[File:Chacal (T2).png|thumb|300px]]
In RB, the Chacal is a fast vessel, able to get to good positions fairly quickly, while also allowing it to capture a point early on. This speed allows the Chacal to get out of sticky situations rapidly, however, this can also be a downside for novice captains or those that are unaware, as this mobility can also lead to the vessel being caught in the open, or finding its way into a group of enemy vessels. The mobility of the Chacal is the only form of protection she has, as only the primary weapons have armour, and being hit while sailing the Chacal can be devastating. The ship is quite compact, having all of its engine equipment and fuel tanks close together, allowing them to easily be disabled or set on fire. On the other hand, the magazines of the main guns are very small, making the Chacal almost immune to being ammo racked. The ship also features a lot of empty space in her forward most compartments, meaning glancing blows will do next to nothing to the vessel. What the Chacal lacks in armour, she makes up for with the number of sailors onboard, giving her above average longevity in combat. The large amount of firepower the Chacal brings to bear allows her to go toe-to-toe with all but the strongest of vessels, and what her guns can't destroy, her torpedoes can easily dispatch.

=== Enemies worth noting: ===
Enemy vessels that mount guns with a high rate of fire, such as the [[USS Mitscher]], [[USS Moffett]], [[Spokoinyy]], and [[SKR-7]] can easily disable the Chacal and strip it of crew. An easy way to deal with these enemies is to disable their guns and then focus fire on the magazines of their weapons, bringing a swift defeat for these ships.

Light cruisers have enough guns to easily dispatch the Chacal, rapidly stripping away her crew and destroying its vulnerable components. On the other hand, most light cruisers the Chacal can face are fairly light on armour and are usually slow, allowing her SAPBC rounds and torpedoes to easily destroy these vessels, and at the very least, her mobility allowing herself to withdraw to safety.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

The Chacal-class ships were born out of a 1922 requirement for a large destroyer, and was the first of a series of large destroyers for the Marine Nationale. The Chacal was the lead ship of her class, and was laid down in 1923, and after construction delays, was finally completed in 1926, entering service the same year. The Chacal was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron, where she spent the next decade as a training ship. Following the outbreak of the war, she was assigned to convoy escort in the Atlantic, until the Battle of France saw her stationed in the English Channel. In 1940, the Chacal was refitted with the Type 123 sonar and had two of her depth charge throwers reinstalled. On the night of 23/24 of May, 1940, she was crippled by German artillery and aircraft, and consequently beached herself near Boulogne-sur-Mer as a result of the damage. The wreckage was never recovered, and can still be seen to this day.
