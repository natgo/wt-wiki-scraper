== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (千鳥, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Plover) was a 600-ton Chidori-class vessel that was designed to avoid the restrictions of the London Navy Treaty on destroyer tonnage. It was classified as a torpedo boat instead of a destroyer, even though it had half the firepower of the [[Ayanami|Fubuki-class]] destroyer. However, the Chidori class had problems with stability and weight due to its excessive armament. The 3rd ship of the class, Tomozuru, capsized during a naval exercise and raised doubts about the quality of Japanese ships. The Chidori class was modified by reducing and changing its weapons (from 12.7 cm to 12 cm guns and removing one torpedo mount) and adding bulges. The remaining 16 ships out of 20 planned were canceled and the funds were redirected to a new Ōtori-class torpedo boat, which had better balance.

The Chidori was introduced in [[Update "Raining Fire"]]. Designed as a lighter vessel carrying destroyer armament to evade the Naval Treaty, in War Thunder as her final 1944 refit she hasn't escaped, and instead faces the destroyers she was designed to mimic with weaker firepower. Only offering a single dual 533 mm torpedo mount and three 12 cm cannons, she plays like a weaker and more vulnerable [[Mutsuki (Family)|Mutsuki-class]], but at the end of the tree resulting in a lengthier grind for the same destroyer introductory gameplay. One of the redeeming factors Chidori has as a 1944 refit is her array of 25 mm anti-air which is far superior to her opponents and will leave pilots surprised to face heavy AA resistance at this tier.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The Chidori in playstyle is closer to a BR {{#unit: jp_destroyer_chidori|br|AB}} (AB) anti-air destroyer than to a motor gun boat. It features just half the main guns and torpedoes of the [[IJN Mutsuki]] (at BR {{#unit: jp_destroyer_mutsuki|br|AB}}), but a much, much more potent secondary, 25 mm battery. Unlike other nations top-tier coastal vessels, it does not have access to the {{Annotation|HE-VT|High-explosive variable time fuse}} shells which puts it in a significant disadvantage comparing to its peers. However, it's still one of the best anti-air options in this BR range for the Japanese fleet, leaving it only to the [[JDS Ayanami (DD-103)]] for providing a more efficient anti-air cover.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Main and secondary guns are able to quickly destroy enemy [[:Category:Boats|boats]]
* Numerous 25 mm guns all throughout the ship offer excellent anti-air cover
* Relatively manoeuvrable

'''Cons:'''

* Large size, no armour, below-average crew count contribute to a low survivability
* Low maximum speed and unable to sail through the shallow waters
* Very slow turret rotation
* Primary cannons have blind spot on back of the ship
* Lacklustre primary guns comparing to any fully-fledged destroyer in the BR range cause the ship to struggle against [[:Category:Frigates|frigates]], [[:Category:Sub-chasers|sub-chasers]] or any bluewater ships
* No access to the {{Annotation|HE-VT|High-explosive variable time fuse}} shells
* No access to the shell chase camera for the primary armament

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
===Design===
The Chidori (Japanese for plover bird) was the first boat of the Chidori-class torpedo boats (Torpedo boat here has a different meaning than a small motor boat, closer to the meaning of destroyer). She was laid down in 1931 at the Maizuru Naval Construction Department.

===Service===
In December 1936, the Torpedo flotilla 21 was formed with the four boats of the same class and advanced toward China, engaged in landing support and blockade operations. After the start of the Pacific War, they supported the strategy of the Japanese Southern expansion. After that, the flotilla was disbanded and Chidori was engaged in convoy escort. Although she was active until the end of the war, the Chidori was sunk by a torpedo of the US submarine "Tilefish" off the coast of Omaezaki in Southern Japan on December 22, 1944.
