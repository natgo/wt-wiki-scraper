== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (ちくご, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Chikugo River) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese frigate {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|3 inch Mk.33 (76 mm)}}

Chikugo carries two 3 inch Mk.33 automatic cannons in twin installation. The turret is placed at the front of the ship and can effectively cover the front and sides of your vessel, but is unable to react to enemies from the rear. HE shells can take care of unarmoured targets especially motor boats which can be destroyed within a few shots. For armoured targets and destroyers you can choose AP shells but you still have to keep in mind that it is a 76 mm multi-purpose cannon. HE-VT shells are good for use in AA roles. These guns heat up quickly so keep an eye on continuous rapid fire or you may lose one or both until repairs complete. Changing between ammunition types is time-consuming and leaves you vulnerable with no ability to return fire until switch is complete.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 1 (40 mm)}}

40 mm Bofors in twin installation is very capable weapon placed on back of Chikugo so it have natural blind spot in front of ship. This means that you can't completely rely on AI as anti-aircraft armament nor its help with naval targets. If you ignore that, its powerful weapon that can shoot down aircraft within seconds and can be used as backup against motorboats that are trying to sneak up on you from behind.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|12.75 inch Mark 46 (324 mm)}}

Two torpedo launchers each able to release three torpedoes are installed on each side of the ship. This means only three torpedoes can be released to each side. They have mediocre 7.3 km range but excellent speed of 91 km/h (one of the best in-game). They are pretty small and don't have much explosive compared to other torpedoes at this rank but will give hard time to any ship they hit.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Chikugo uses the destroyer spawn but don't be fooled, it can't compete with the firepower of other destroyers at long range. The best way to stay alive is to focus on motor boats and sub-chasers and avoid any contact with destroyers even if it takes more time to get there. Then it's best to stay little back and use the excellent mid-range capabilities of your main armament. If you ever have to encounter destroyers, it should be at close range and you should give them everything you have, meaning main cannon with AP or HE shells, secondary Bofors with AP belt, and torpedoes. Try to hit lethal parts like cannons or ammunition with AP shells or you can try to get rid of his crew with HE shells.

On the other hand, the main gun can load high explosive shells with time variable fuse, when combined with functional radar and secondary armament you will be a nightmare to every pilot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Radar
* Able to equip AP and HE-VT shells
* Secondary armament is capable against all kind of targets

'''Cons:'''

* Only destroyer spawn although its most effective against other sub-chasers
* Not able to release all torpedoes to one side
* Aiming with secondary armament can be difficult due to convergence of bridge and weapon
* Switching between ammunition types for 76mm guns takes a long time

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
