== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
Colbert was the second of the [[Suffren (Family)|Suffren-class]] cruisers. Designed as a light cruiser, she had typical issues for the Washington Treaty cruisers. Through the interwar period, she was based in Toulon. During World War Two, she participated in Operation Vado, shelling the Italian ports of Genoa and Vado Ligure, without much success. With the fall of France and the creation of the Vichy French Navy, she remained part of the Vichy forces, along with the other vessels stationed in mainland France. With Case Anton, the German military occupation of Vichy France, French sailors scuttled Colbert, along with the rest of the French fleet at Toulon, on 27 November 1942. Her burned-out wreck was scrapped after the war.

Colbert was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]] as a heavy cruiser, owing to the calibre of the main guns and the overall displacement. She is a very good performer against soft targets thanks to outstanding SAP shells, but lacks the survivability or mobility to consistently dictate engagements with enemy vessels. She is best used in the second line, picking off targets while avoiding attention. When fired upon, her best chance is to lay down a smoke screen and retreat, rather than continue the direct exchange. Her two hydroplanes can be used to capture points without exposing the vessel or laying additional smoke screens, while torpedoes can be used for opportunistic kills, especially on open sea maps.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
With a maximum armour thickness of 50 mm, Colbert is outclassed by all of the foregin heavy cruisers in the similar BR and majority of the light cruisers, including the likes of [[USS Atlanta]] or [[RN Eugenio di Savoia]]. This is not helped by only an average crew count for the vessel in her BR, making Colbert one of the most fragile cruisers.

At the close range she has an slight advantage in the magazines being located below the water line, with even the top edge of the magazines being about 2-3 meters below, making them a little bit less likely to explode.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
In terms of mobility, Colbert is rather typical for the cruisers in its BR. Power, turn rate, rudder turning time and engine mode changing time all are within 10% of average comparable vessels

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|203 mm/50 model 1924 (203 mm)}}

Main guns feature an exceptionally potent {{Annotation|SAP|Semi-armour-piercing}} shell, able to do much more damage than the foreign equivalents. But the main issue with the main guns is the lack of the dedicated {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}} shells, making it impossible to counter heavily armoured targets. In fact, Colbert will struggle to penetrate most of the heavy cruisers and even some of the light cruisers, making it preferable to focus on fighting the soft targets, and rewarding knowledge of the armour on the enemy vessels.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|90 mm/50 model 1926 (90 mm)}}

Eight, single-mount 90 mm secondary guns are primarily an anti-air weapons, being able to engage even the dive bombers thanks to +80° vertical guidance. {{Annotation|HE-TF|High-explosive with time fuze}} rounds are a preferable first choice for the secondaries, as they maximise the chance of damaging an enemy airplane, either by a direct hit or a shrapnel from a nearby explosion. HE-TF rounds can also be used against coastal vessels, as in a short range they will work like a regular {{Annotation|HE|High-explosive}} shells, though switching to an anti-air armament can be a better choice when dealing with a small, manoeuvring torpedo boats.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|37 mm/50 model 1925 (37 mm)|37 mm/50 model 1933 (37 mm)|Model 1929 Hotchkiss (13.2 mm)|Browning (13.2 mm)}}

Nearly all the anti-air armament is concentrated around the bridge superstructure and on the aft superstructure - between the aft funnels and rear main guns. 37 mm guns are excellent, able to engage incoming airplanes at a significant distance, with even a single hit being enough to cripple single-engined planes and do significant damage to larger bombers. In contrast, 13.2 mm machine guns really struggle to deal with both: aerial and surface targets alike, lacking both: the stopping power and range to effectively counter hostiles. Overall capabilities of the anti-air guns can be described as adequate, though on a low end of the capabilities.

It's worth noting that the 37 mm is an excellent calibre to deal with a light, fast motor torpedo boats, being able to stop them at a sagnificant range and counter ambushes.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Model 1923DT (550 mm)}}

Divided between one triple-launcher on each side, there are six torpedoes in total, with additional 4 in the reloads for the total of 10 torpedoes onboard. The torpedoes themselves offer a great combination of speed and range, complemented by a substantial warhead. As a result, they prove effective for both short-range engagements and long-range area denial.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}
Loire 130С is a significant improvement over a much more common French hydroplane - [[GL.832HY]]. Loire has a higher speed, manoeuvrability, better defensive armament and exceptionally high bomb load for a [[shipboard reconnaissance aircraft]] - two 75 kg bombs, for a total of 46.27 kg of explosives, nearly double of some of the more common hydroplanes. Still, being as fragile as all the other hydroplanes, Loire shouldn't be used for bombing, and even the weakest coastal vessels have more than enough armament to shred it into pieces.

The ability to carry two vessels at a time effectively translates to being able to capture multiple enemy cap points, making it a great utility, especially when using boosters, to secure the wins even against an enemy fleet superior in firepower.

Due to the relatively low survivability of the cruiser, it might be advised to use airplane-deployed [[Smoke screen#Naval Forces|smoke screen]] in order to cover the retreat, or even simply hide the vessel from a specific enemy for the 30 seconds that the smoke lasts.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Colbert is a challenging heavy cruiser to play, owning it to a poor survivability and no means of countering enemy heavy cruisers or battleships. She has to cherry-pick targets below her in the pecking order, while avoiding contact. This is best assisted by carefully using islands as a hard cover or smoke screens - either from the cruiser or its hydroplanes. And, of course, spawning after the first few friendlies are already in the match, then keeping in the second line rather than rushing forward, in order to avoid attention.

That said, when Colbert has an opportunity to fight with the enemies on her terms, she will outgun a majority of the soft targets, being able to easily blow up enemy destroyers at range and pick off softer light cruisers, often crippling their offensive capabilities with a single broadside on target.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
