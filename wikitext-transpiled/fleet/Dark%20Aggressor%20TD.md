== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "New Power"]] as a [[wt:en/news/6968-more-twitch-drops-en|reward for watching War Thunder streams on Twitch.tv]] along with a unique skin for the vehicle.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

Dark Aggressor has the following armour layout:

* Hull: 40 mm, wood
* Superstructure: 15 mm, wood

Dark Aggressor has no armour at all, lacking even a gun shield for the main cannon. Right beneath the gun are also two large ammunition racks. These cannot be removed unless all ammo for the main gun is emptied. Altogether, with a crew complement of only 15, Dark Aggressor's survivability is low.

On top of this, being a small boat, she can be hull-broken by any gun with a diameter above 4 inches (102 mm). At Dark Aggressor's battle rating, there are three guns capable of hull-break: the [[8cwt QF Mk I (114 mm)]] (found on {{Specs-Link|uk_dark_class}}), the [[10.5 cm SK C/32 (105 mm)|10.5 cm SK C/32]] (found on {{Specs-Link|germ_artilleriefahrprahm_typ_d3}}), and the [[120 mm/45 Type 3 (120 mm)|120 mm/45 Type 3]] (found on {{Specs-Link|jp_escort_hiburi_class_syonan}}). Luckily for Dark Aggressor, though, the first two are quite rare to see and are mounted on vehicles that are easily knocked out themselves, and the third is a rather bad cannon that most players don't even use. This makes hull-breaks fairly rare.

All things considered, aside from the ammunition racks in the bow, Dark Aggressor's survivability is more or less average. Low survivability and the ability to be hull-broken are the norms for most boats at this battle rating, and really shouldn't be looked at as a disadvantage on the part of Dark Aggressor.

=== Mobility ===

Dark Aggressor's maximum speeds, mobility, acceleration, and stopping are all average, not too much better or worse than any of the other fast motor torpedo boats or motor gun boats around her battle rating.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells.

{{main|QF Mark VII (40 mm)}}

In her primary armament group, Dark Aggressor has a single 40 mm QF Mark VII in a single mount just in front of the bridge. It has 1,500 rounds of ammunition available for it. It can traverse horizontally at a rate of 40°/s and vertically at a rate of 34°/s. The gun has a magazine capacity of 4 rounds and has a rate of fire of 160 rounds/min. With a stock crew, the gun can be reloaded in 0.49 seconds; with an aced crew, it can be reloaded in 0.38 seconds. Firing the gun for too long will cause it to jam. Its maximum range against surface targets is roughly 3.25 km.

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.VIII (533 mm)|Mk.VII depth charge}}

Dark Aggressor has four torpedo tubes, two on each side, and can carry a total of four 533 mm Mk.VIII torpedoes. The torpedo tubes are pointed forwards, but are angled outwards on each side. They are fixed, requiring the boat to be turned in order to aim them.

The Dark Aggressor can carry two Mk.VII depth charges mounted on the aft, one on each side facing outwards. The depth charges drop one-at-a-time in the following order (see the image):

# Starboard side
# Port side

Before spawning, the detonation time delay can be set anywhere between 3 seconds and 10 seconds.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Ammunition Choices

The best ammunition choice is 40 mm HE clips because it has the highest ratio of HE rounds to AP rounds, which means it has the highest effectiveness against both aircraft and surface targets. The 40 mm HE clips should be the primary ammunition type used, but several 40 mm AP clips should also be taken into battle for use against certain armoured targets and against enemies sailing directly bow-in. In the latter case, HE rounds will detonate on a possibly already-destroyed bow compartment, leaving the rest of the vessel unharmed. AP rounds will pass through the bow compartment and deal damage to the rear of the vessel.

From arcade battle experience, AP rounds are more versatile in battle and are the better choice in most situations, especially when engaging surface targets of similar size within tier 2 and always try to resolve direct fights as quickly as possible (either by winning or disengaging as quickly as possible). This boat is best used when outranging, flanking or ambushing the opposition given the facts it possesses poor armour, but the gun can sustain long periods of continued fire therefore, strafing targets is encouraged.

;Torpedoes

The 18-inch Mk.XII is fairly average in terms of maximum speed and range, but it has a very low TNT equivalence compared to other torpedoes at this tier. Still, a hit with the Mk.XII torpedo on any boat at this tier is more than enough to destroy it. Otherwise, this is torpedo is unnoteworthy.

The Torpedo Mode modification should always be installed. The higher maximum speed is much more valuable against the fast-moving boats of tier I and II, and the maps are small enough that the reduction to the maximum range doesn't really matter.

;Depth Charges

Being anti-submarine weapons and with the present lack of submarines in the game, there is practically no reason to use them. While they can be used against surface targets, this is extremely situational. Sailing up right next to a slower target and dropping a depth charge can lead to some success, though again, this is very situational. If attempting this, remember the order in which the depth charges drop and that there is no reason to use any depth charge activation time setting above the minimum 3 seconds, since higher delay times means the depth charge will sink further, and thus away, from the target. Again, it should be reiterated that this is very situational.

There is no practical reason to take them into battle, since, if they're not dropped, they essentially become unarmoured ammo racks.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 40 mm QF Mark VII: powerful HE rounds, very high-penetration AP rounds (80 mm)
* Very quick reload, practically continuous fire
* Can outrange most enemies

'''Cons:'''

* 40 mm QF Mark VII cannot fire directly backwards and takes a long time to cool
* Main armament easily knocked out
* No secondary or AA guns
* Two large ammo racks below the forward gun, cannot be removed
