== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the British fleet closed beta test. With the split of the naval tech trees in [[Update "New Power"]], {{PAGENAME}} was moved to the coastal fleet tech tree.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} has the following armour layout:

* Hull: 40 mm, wood
* Superstructure: 15 mm, wood

[[File:{{PAGENAME}}_internals.png|thumb|Dark Aggressor internals (starboard side).]]

Like most coastal vessels, the Dark Aggressor has no practical armour. The hull and superstructure are unarmoured and will not stop any sort of gunfire.

The hull is split into four hull sections. Starting from the bow and working towards the stern, the first section starts at the bow and ends just in front of the gun; the second ends after the bridge; the third ends where the fuel tanks end, just in front of the engines; and the fourth ends at the stern. Any round with a large enough diameter and explosive mass can hull break the Dark Aggressor. In general, this is limited to HE rounds greater with a diameter greater than or equal to 4 inches (102 mm) and with an explosive mass greater than 1.5 kg. At the Dark Aggressor's battle rating, the only guns that can hull break her are:

* the [[10.5 cm SK C/32 (105 mm)|10.5 cm SK C/32]], found on {{Specs-Link|germ_escort_typem1943}} and {{Specs-Link|germ_artilleriefahrprahm_typ_d3}}; and
* the [[8cwt QF Mk I (114 mm)|114 mm 8cwt QF Mk I]], found on {{Specs-Link|uk_dark_class}}.

There is one ammunition storage located directly underneath the gun turret just above the waterline. Destroying it will instantly destroy the boat.

The Dark Aggressor has a crew complement of 15. With a stock crew, the Dark Aggressor is knocked out when 10 crew are lost; with an aced crew, this is increased to 11. Overall, the survivability is average.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The Dark Aggressor has a displacement of 64 tons.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The recommended modification research order is:

# Tool Set
# Fire Protection System
# 40 mm HE clips
# 40 mm AP clips
# Propeller Replacement
# Primary Armament Targeting
# Artillery Support

After that, prioritize the rest of the seakeeping modifications first, then finish researching the remaining modifications in whatever order you prefer.

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|QF Mark VII (40 mm)}}

The primary armament consists of a single 40 mm QF Mk VII cannon mounted forward with a maximum ammunition load of 1,500 rounds. Stock, the mount can traverse horizontally at a rate of 34°/s and vertically at a rate of 29°/s; with the "Primary Armament Targeting" modification installed, this is increased to 40°/s and 34°/s respectively. The gun has a magazine capacity of 4 rounds and a cycle rate of fire of 160 rounds/min. With a stock crew, it can be reloaded in 0.49 seconds; with an aced crew, this is decreased to 0.38 seconds. The reload is short enough that there is a seamless transition between magazines, although continuously firing for too long will cause the gun to overheat and jam. This happens after continuously firing for about 1.25 min, or about 200 rounds. There is no noticeable drop in accuracy as the gun overheats.

There are three ammunition types available:

* '''Universal:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}
* '''40 mm HE clips:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}

{{:QF Mark VII (40 mm)/Ammunition|HEFI-T, AP-T}}

The best ammunition is the 40 mm HE clips because it has the highest ratio of HE rounds to AP rounds. Take mostly 40 mm HE clips along with several 40 mm AP clips for armoured targets. Because of the gun's seamless reload, there is no reason to use the Universal belt once the others are unlocked.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.VIII (533 mm)|Mk.VII depth charge}}

The {{PAGENAME}} has two possible loadouts:

# 4 x Mk.VIII torpedo
# 2 x Mk.VII depth charge
# 4 x Mk.VIII torpedo; 2 x Mk.VII depth charge
# Without load

'''Torpedoes'''

The Dark Aggressor can carry four 533 mm Mk.VIII torpedoes. The torpedo tubes are located on either side of the bridge, pointing forwards with the nose angled outwards.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center" width="100%"
! colspan="9" | Torpedo characteristics
|-
! Torpedo Mode !! Mass (kg) !! Maximum speed in water (km/h) !! Travel distance (km) !! Depth stroke (m) !! Arming distance (m) !! Explosive type !! Explosive mass (kg) !! TNT equivalent (kg)

|-
| {{Annotation|Yes|'Torpedo Mode' modification installed}} || 1,566 || 76 || 6.40 || 1 || 50 || TNT || 327 || 327
|}

The Torpedo Mode modification is available as a rank IV modification. Installing it will give the following changes:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! colspan="2" | Torpedo mode specification changes
|-
! Max Distance (m)
! Max Speed (m/s)
|-
| +1,830 || -2
|-
|}

It's best to always keep Torpedo Mode uninstalled. The maximum speed of a torpedo is much more valuable in coastal battles than its maximum range. Coastal fleet maps are also small enough that the decreased range with Torpedo Mode installed isn't much of an issue.

In RB, always set the depth stroke to the minimum 1 m setting. This is because many vessels that the Dark Aggressor can face will not have a deep enough draught to fuse the torpedo at a depth stroke setting of 4 m. In AB, depth stroke is automatically set to the most optimal setting.

When using torpedoes, be aware that unless they are already launched, the torpedoes have a very high chance to detonate when shot at, instantly destroying the boat. To avoid this, fire the torpedoes immediately after spawning in—as well as after any subsequent reloads in AB—or simply don't take them at all. Torpedoes are a situational weapon, so it's largely down to personal preference whether or not to take them.

'''Depth charges'''

[[File:{{PAGENAME}}_DC_Order.png|thumb|Mk.VII depth charges numbered according to their drop order (click to view a larger image).]]

The Mk.VII depth charges are carried on the stern, one on each side. They are dropped one at a time in the following order:

# Starboard
# Port

Before spawning, the detonation time delay can be set anywhere between 3 seconds and 10 seconds.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! colspan="7" | Depth charge characteristics

|-
| 196 || TNT || 130 || 130 || 101 || 8 || 122
|}

There is almost no practical reason to use depth charges on any naval vessel in the game. Although they usually result in a one-hit kill if used properly, they are extremely situational, requiring the player to close to point-blank ranges to even use them. In almost every case, anytime a depth charge could be used, the guns or torpedoes can be used instead to greater effect. In fact, depth charges tend to actually be a liability in battle, since they essentially act as exposed ammo racks before they're dropped. Like torpedoes, they can be shot at, and if destroyed, they have a chance to detonate, instantly destroying the boat.

Despite this, some success can be had in dropping them either next to, or in front of a large, slow target. If dropping them next to the target, remember the depth charge drop order, since it's most likely that only the depth charges dropped on the side closest to the enemy will deal any damage. If dropping in front of the target, rush in from the sides as quickly as possible and drop them all at once directly in front of the target. For both cases, set the depth charge time delay to the minimum 3 seconds, since any higher time delay will only allow the depth charge to sink further away from the target, giving them more time to move out of the way. Again, using depth charges is extremely situational, and they will only be a liability the vast majority of the time, so take them at your own discretion.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Compared to the  sister gunboat [[Dark Adventurer]], the {{PAGENAME}} is a traditional PT boats and plays like one, with some slight caveat. The boat features four powerful torpedoes and frontal-mounted Bofors autocannons in exchange of the 114 mm cannons. Due to the lack of rear coverage, however, the boat is highly vulnerable against flankers or enemy aircraft approaching the stern. Because of this, let your bow face the enemy as much as possible to minimize the chance of ammo rack detonation.

As the Bofors have a higher effective range than most of the ~20 mm autocannons that were quite common at this BR, the {{PAGENAME}} can also be used to provide fire support at longer ranges (~2.5 km) and outrange most of the PT boats. As the Bofors can seamlessly switch between each ammo belt, the AP belt is recommended for long range engagements, though the "Universal" belt can also do its job quite well at range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* Features a frontal-mounted Bofors autocannons with good frontal coverage
* 40 mm Bofors offer great damage output against surface and aerial targets
* Fast and manoeuvrable
* Armed with four torpedoes with good speed and filler

'''Cons:'''
* Mediocre survivability, especially from the sides
* Somewhat tall, unarmoured hull profile with a highly vulnerable ammo racks
* Main armament is easily knocked out
* No secondary or anti-aircraft armament, the stern is effectively a huge blind spot
