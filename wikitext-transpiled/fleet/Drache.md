== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German sub-chaser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
While it has barely any armour like the majority of coastal ships, the Drache is compensated for by its huge crew complement of 300 and plenty of hull space, thus significantly buffing its survivability.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Drache is rather slow, with its two diesel engines barely competing with various submarine chasers found at its BR.

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|88 mm/45 SK L/45 (88 mm)}}
The Drache has a pair of 88 mm guns, which are perfect for combating larger opponents you may face (e.g. [[Type K-7 No.4|Japanese submarine chasers]]). The HE rounds can be used to make short work of any PT boats while the APCBC shells may be saved for more heavily armoured boats like the [[MBK pr.186]] which are more common at your BR.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|SK C/30 (37 mm)}}
In addition to the 88 mm guns, there are also two dual 37 mm mounts, with a choice of AP and HE shells. They should be kept as second-hand weapons as their rate of fire is lesser than their [[FlaK-Lafette C/36 (37 mm)|autocannon counterparts]].

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2 cm/65 C/38 (20 mm)|2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 (20 mm)}}

The Drache sports an extremely powerful anti-aircraft arsenal of two 20 mm Flakvierling 38 guns and two Flakzwilling 38 guns, which can shred any aircraft or PT boat that would be foolish enough to dare and try to approach you.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|EMC mine|WBG depth charge}}

While both the mines and depth charges are potent if utilized correctly, they are purely situational and may act more as a larger ammo rack than an effective weapon; It is advised not to bring them with you.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Drache is a powerful yet slow ship and should be played as such. Since you have a coastal spawn, one such tactic would be to try and provide fire support for your team, taking out PT boats with ease as you hobble over to the capture point. Once you reach the capture point, defending it should be your top priority. You can use your potent 88 mm guns at this point to knock out enemies your team would otherwise have trouble dealing with (e.g. [[SF40 Light|AA ferries]] or the [[Albatros]]).

Another tactic you can use is to be the damage absorber of your team, using your huge amounts of empty space to soak up large amounts of damage while also shielding the rest of your teammates. Though you are capable of withstanding torpedoes, depth charges and some bombs, you are not invincible. Some players may try and stick very close to you to take advantage of your non-existent gun depression and incapacitate you. However, if you react quickly enough with your 20 mm guns this can be avoided.
===Enemies worth noting===
*'''Soviet post-war boats/frigates (MPK Pr.12412, SKR-7)''': Should you get uptiered, these boats will be your greatest concern. Their 76 mm guns have a significantly faster fire rate than yours, leaving you with little chance to return fire. It is advised not to engage them at any cost unless you have no other choice.
*'''Destroyers''': Various destroyers like the aforementioned are in plentiful supply around your BR, and their armament significantly outweighs yours. While they might have a harder time trying to sink you than most other ships due to your large amounts of empty space that will absorb damage, it is also strongly advised not to engage them.
=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* Accurate main guns that can knock out PT boats in a few hits
* Powerful secondary armament
* Large and empty hull space allows the boat to absorb hits from bombs and enemy fire
* Huge crew count for a boat with coastal spawn

'''Cons:'''
* Has only two main guns that are too weak to effectively damage destroyers or frigates
* Very slow and sluggish to manoeuvre
* Large and easily recognisable profile
