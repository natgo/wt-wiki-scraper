== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Emden had very good survivability and the perfect amount of guns coupled with decent reload times and firepower. Together, this means you can output a lot of damage in a short period of time against other ships. The "turtleback" armour on this ship is what makes it special, even though it may not appear to have the best armour, its 50 mm layer along with another highly sloped 40 mm solid armour layer behind it, makes it extremely difficult to sink the light cruiser.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
When stock, the Emden is noticeably sluggish to move around, with a top speed of only 47 km/h (AB/RB) and very poor traverse speed. After getting repair kits and FPE, rudder replacement should be considered as it helps the Emden be much more nimble.

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|15 cm/48 KC/36 (150 mm)}}

The Emden utilizes eight 15 cm cannons, the same armament found on [[Type 1936A (Mob)]], each mounted on a single gun turret. The placements of the guns allowed it to fire four guns from the bow-on and slight angling position. As a light cruiser, the Emden gains access to a powerful APCBC to deal with heavier targets.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|SK C/32 (105 mm)}}

Secondary armament consisted of three 10.5 cm cannons, these cannons is moderately useful at close range against destroyers and PT boats. It has access to a time fuze shell to improve the ship's anti-air capabilities. However, due to low ammunition count, it is advised to manage your AI gunners to not waste it on any targets you can deal with by yourself.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets.

{{main|Bofors Flak 28 (40 mm)|2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 (20 mm)|2 cm/65 Flakzwilling 38 (20 mm)}}

The Emden possess some of the most powerful anti-aircraft armament at its rank. With two Bofors autocannons and twenty 20 mm FlaK cannons placed all over the ship. Any aircraft that were approaching the Emden will be greeted with a bullet storm of large and small calibres. This AA armament is also very useful for fending off PT boats that might come close to it, although it is always recommended to man the gun yourself when the enemy is too close.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|G7a (533 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following:

* 4 x 53 cm G7a torpedoes (warhead = 280 kg Hexanite)

These torpedoes are standard issue Kriegsmarine torpedoes which had good speed, endurance, and good firing angle (minimum angle 16 degrees).

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Emden is unusual among light cruisers for having wonderful armour. While the initial row of belt armour is only 50 mm thick, this is backed up by another layer of 40 mm armour in a turtleback layout that gives this ship great anti-torpedo protection, and protects ammo stowage from enemy shells. The guns on the Emden are also good, with the 150 mm cannons doing good damage to enemy cruisers and with good shell velocity. While the rate of fire is good, it falls off once the first stage of 10 rounds is depleted. Also, while you have a lot of guns, they're spread out and rather inaccurate. The broadside is only 6 guns, and the dispersion is pretty poor. The Emden also boasts good AA protection, especially at close range, and its torpedoes have a nasty bite, with good damage and top speed.

The Emden is a slow ship, doing just 47 km/h when stock, which can feel awfully slow after the very fast destroyers that precede it. Also, while the armour protection is great, the crew size is not. Flooding and fires, if they're not quickly brought under control, can be disastrous for an Emden. Combined with the fairly weak deck armour, this makes this ship particularly vulnerable to aircraft, though your AA guns should reduce this risk somewhat.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very well armoured structure that can take many hits
* Has the German turtleback armour layout, which is quite effective at containing damage
* Possesses powerful 15 cm guns
* Secondary 10.5 cm guns can be used as an anti-aircraft armament with time fuze shell
* Great anti-air armament
* Good bow-on firepower
* Decent torpedo launch angle, capable of launching it directly from the bow

'''Cons:'''

* Each 15 cm turrets is poorly protected and will be slowly taken out in a prolonged firefight
* Quite slow and sluggish for a light cruiser, especially when stock
* Has a chance to face heavy cruisers capable of destroying it in a few salvoes
* Very small amount of shells for the secondary guns (10.5 cm), so take care to conserve ammunition by disabling the AI gunners

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
After losing in the First World War and signing the Treaty of Versailles, Germany faced severe restrictions in terms of its military power and the creation of new weapons. As a result, for example, Germany was forbidden from building new cruisers until the service life of those remaining after the war had reached 20 years. However, even in those cases, Germany was not allowed to go beyond strictly defined technical specs when designing a future ship. In 1921, construction of a new light cruiser began in the Wilhelmshaven naval shipyard. The ship was meant to replace the Niobe cruiser, which had been built way back in 1899. After several delays, the cruiser was launched in January 1925 and solemnly named "Emden." The ship inherited the name from a well-known World War I cruiser that had been sunk in the Indian Ocean.

Due to the country's dire economical state, the tactical technical specifications of the new ship ended up being way below those that Germany was allowed to implement in the project. In essence, Emden was obsolete from the construction stage. However, this light cruiser ended up becoming the most upgradable ship of the German fleet. During the 1926-1945 period, extensive work was performed on the cruiser: the coal-fired boilers were replaced with oil-fired ones, new 533 mm torpedo tubes were fitted onto ship, the anti-air armament was significantly improved, the obsolete 150 mm armament of the kaiser era were substituted with more powerful alternatives, and the radar system became subject to numerous upgrades. The cruiser was involved in a lot of adventures during her service time before the start of the war – with eight long-distance cruises under her belt (pun intended), Emden had practically been in every corner of the world. During the Second World War, Emden was primarily used as a training ship and a military communications centre. In 1945, the Emden light cruiser was fatally damaged by a British air dropped bomb and subsequently sunk.
