== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Lacking any significant armour protection, Emile Bertin has to rely on her speed, manoeuvrability, low profile, and crew distribution to survive incoming fire. Just looking at the lowest crew count and poorest armour in her BR, one would expect her to be the most fragile ship in the BR. However, realistically, she's still able to take a decent amount of punishment thanks to the well-distributed internal components.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Able to reach an astounding 87 km/h in Arcade Battles, Emile Bertin features the highest top speed among cruisers in its BR, which is over 10 km/h higher than that of the majority of other cruisers. She's able to outspeed even a typical destroyer.

Due to her size, which is much larger than that of a typical destroyer, she's not able to manoeuvre nearly as well as destroyers can. Therefore, her speed should be used for positioning rather than racing against destroyers to the capture points.

{{NavalMobility}}

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Due to her already excellent mobility and turret rotation speeds, one can prioritize Unsinkability and the rest of the Firepower upgrades. Prioritizing SAPBC and APCBC rounds can also be beneficial, as they have a lot of use in the BR range (to simplify: HE rounds for destroyers, SAPBC rounds for light cruisers, and APCBC rounds for armoured targets).

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|152 mm/55 model 1930 (152 mm)}}

The 152 mm/55 model 1930 guns are grouped in two triple turrets forward and one triple turret aft. This configuration makes Emile Bertin excellent for offensive action, allowing her to outgun most destroyers while still dealing a decent amount of damage against enemy cruisers. Taking a closer look at each shell type:

* '''OEA Mle 1937 HE''' - very good broadside damage per minute, large explosive filler and excellent muzzle velocity make it best used against destroyers and coastal vessels, but it can also be used to ignite fires on enemy warships and take down exposed crew.
* '''OPF Mle 1937 SAPBC''' - compared to other cruisers at this BR, when firing broadsides with SAP shells, it also boasts one of the best damage outputs per minute, while featuring sufficient penetration to counter light cruisers or even some of the heavy cruisers.
* '''OPF Mk.35 APCBC''' - the APCBC broadside has an average damage characteristic and, with 157mm penetration at 30° at 7,500 meters, it's capable of penetrating the magazines of nearly every cruiser she encounters.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|90 mm/50 model 1926 (90 mm)}}

The secondary weapons can be considered primarily as long-range anti-air guns. Once the {{Annotation|HE-TF|High-explosive with time fuse}} shells are researched, they should be the preferred ammunition type for the 90 mm gun. However, its rate of fire, which amounts to 1 salvo every 4 seconds, and its inability to fire in frontal arcs, render it somewhat ineffective against coastal vessels. Additionally, the low calibre of these weapons results in inefficiency when attempting to engage enemy destroyers.

{{:90 mm/50 model 1926 (90 mm)/Ammunition|90 mm OEA Mle 1925 HE, 90 mm OEA Mle 1925 HE-TF}}

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|37 mm/50 model 1933 (37 mm)|Model 1929 Hotchkiss (13.2 mm)|Browning (13.2 mm)}}

The medium-range 37 mm guns have an acceptable rate of fire and excellent coverage, as the four guns located to the sides of the superstructure can fire directly forward, to the rear, and 90° vertically. This configuration ensures that there is almost always at least one barrel on target.

For short-range defense, the ship is equipped with low-calibre 13.2 mm guns. While each gun individually may not deliver as much firepower as the 20 mm guns commonly found on foreign cruisers, their placement in multiple locations across the hull increases the likelihood of hitting the target.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
[[File:Mle 1922T launch tube.png|thumb|right|Starboard triple torpedo tube]]
{{main|Model 1923DT (550 mm)}}

Divided between two triple-launchers on each side, there are six torpedoes boasting an impressively wide firing angle (over 110°). This excellent firing angle, combined with the torpedoes being stealthily painted black, significantly enhances their role as a surprise weapon. The dark colour of the torpedoes can make them even more difficult to spot when paired with any of the alternative ship camouflages (such as the Tricolor wavy camouflage).

The torpedoes themselves offer a great combination of speed and range, complemented by a substantial warhead. As a result, they prove effective for both short-range engagements and long-range area denial.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

The single floatplane lacks any offensive armament, bombs or smokescreen generator making it suitable almost only for passively capturing points and spotting.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Emile Bertin stands as a premier light cruiser within its BR, featuring remarkable effectiveness across all ranges and encompassing nearly everything one could desire in a light cruiser.

When confronting enemy warships, it is best to focus the initial salvos on disabling at least a portion of their primary armament. But even if that's impossible, Emile Bertin can outgun most adversaries in a one-on-one engagement.

Key enemies:

* '''[[USS Atlanta]]''' is one of the most challenging opponents and it's best engaged with opening of a High Explosive rounds to disable its turrets, followed by AP rounds going for the rear [[ammo racks]]. When the range of engagement is below 5 km, hitting frontal ammo racks becomes exceptionally difficult due to their position deep below the waterline. In such a case, keeping turrets offline while manoeuvring for a more advantageous angle is the best option.
* '''[[Colbert]]''' broadside-to-broadside can easily counter Emile Bertin, having both: higher damage output and armour able to stop the SAP shells. It's best to make use of the superior speed and an advantage in a number of guns firing forward to choose the location and angle of engagement, denying Colbert a broadside engagement.
* '''[[Leipzig]]''' has exposed ammo racks aft of the turrets. While HE rounds will fail to do damage, SAP shells can reach them broadside. When engaging a heavily angled Leipzig beyond a 5 km range, it is best to employ AP ammunition instead.
* '''Japanese cruisers''' can typically be destroyed using SAP munitions targeting their ammo racks. However, extra caution is warranted, as their widely used SAP rounds have the potential to deal a surprising amount of damage to the poorly armoured Emile Bertin.
* '''US heavy cruisers''' ([[USS Portland]], [[USS Pensacola]], [[USS Northampton]]) prove to be exceedingly challenging for HE and SAP rounds. Their two-layered armour easily counters SAP shells, making AP the best choice for effective engagement at any range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.
