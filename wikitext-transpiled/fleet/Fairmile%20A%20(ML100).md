== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the British fleet closed beta test. With the split of the naval tech trees in [[Update "New Power"]], {{PAGENAME}} was moved to the coastal fleet tech tree.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

Fairmile A (ML100) has the following armour layout:

* Hull: 24 mm, wood
* Superstructure: 2 mm, steel

Any gun in the game will easily be able to penetrate the hull and superstructure at any practical range.

The hull is split into four sections. Starting from the bow and working towards the stern, the first compartment starts at the bow and ends in the middle of the bridge, just in front of the pumps; the second ends just between the radio station and the engines, around the funnel; the third ends in front of the aft gun mount; and the fourth ends at the stern. 

Fairmile A (ML100) can be hull-broken by any round with a large enough diameter and explosive mass. In general, this is limited to HE rounds greater with a diameter greater than or equal to 4 inches (102 mm) with an explosive mass greater than 1.5 kg. At Fairmile A (ML100)'s own battle rating, there is only one gun capable of hull-breaking her:

* the [[8cwt QF Mk I (114 mm)|114 mm 8cwt QF Mk I]], found on {{Specs-Link|uk_dark_class}}.

There are two ammunition storages: the first, holding the ammunition for the secondary armament, is located in the bow below the fore twin 7.72 mm Lewis 1916 machine gun mount. The other ammunition storage, holding the ammunition for the primary armament, is located in the stern on the port side, below and behind the aft 3 pdr QF Hotchkiss cannon. Both ammunition storages are located just above the waterline and destroying either will instantly destroy the boat.

Fairmile A (ML100) has a crew complement of 14. With a stock crew, it is knocked out when 9 crew are lost; with an aced crew, this is increased to 10. Overall, the survivability is average.

{{main|3 pdr QF Hotchkiss (47 mm)}}

The primary armament consists of a single 47 mm 3 pdr QF Hotchkiss cannon mounted aft, with a maximum of 300 rounds of ammunition. Stock, the mount can traverse horizontally at a rate of 34°/s and vertically at a rate of 21°/s; with the "Primary Armament Targeting" modification installed, this is increased to 40°/s and 25°/s respectively. The gun is single-shot with a nominal rate of fire of 30 rounds/min. With a stock crew, it can be reloaded in 2.6 seconds; with an aced crew, it can be reloaded in 2 seconds.

{{main|Lewis 1916 (7.72 mm)}}

The secondary armament consists of six 7.72 mm Lewis 1916 machineguns in three twin mounts, one mount on the bow and the other two amidships. There are 3,880 rounds of ammunition available for each mount, 1,940 rounds per gun, for a total of 11,640 rounds. Stock, the mounts can traverse horizontally at a rate of 64°/s and vertically at a rate of 55°/s; with the "Auxiliary Armament Targeting" modification installed, this is increased to 75°/s and 65°/s respectively. Each gun has a magazine capacity of 97 rounds and a cyclic rate of fire of around 550 rounds/min. With a stock crew, the guns can be reloaded in 18.2 seconds; with an aced crew, they can be reloaded in 14 seconds.

There are three ammunition types available:

* '''Universal:''' {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}{{-}}{{Annotation|T|Tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}{{-}}{{Annotation|T|Tracer}}
* '''7.7 mm AP belt:''' {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}{{-}}{{Annotation|T|Tracer}}

{{:Lewis 1916 (7.72 mm)/Ammunition|AP naval, T naval, IT naval}}

While the armour-piercing round and the the incendiary tracer round deal about the same amount of the damage, the standard tracer round deals incredibly little damage to both surface targets and aircraft. Because of this, the AP belt is a strict upgrade from the default belt. Compared to the AP rounds, the IT rounds also have a much higher muzzle velocity. Altogether, this makes the API belt the best overall, due both to its lack of standard tracer rounds and better ballistic properties.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.VII depth charge|Type M Mark I mine}}

{{PAGENAME}} has three possible loadouts:

# 12x Mk.VII depth charge
# 5x Type M Mk I mines
# Without load

'''Depth Charges'''

[[File:{{PAGENAME}}_DC_Order.png|thumb|Mk.VII depth charges numbered according to their drop order.]]

The Mk.VII depth charges are carried in racks amidships between the funnel and the aft gun mount, six on each side. They are dropped in the following order: foremost to aftmost and alternating port to starboard, starting with the foremost depth charge on the port side.

Before spawning, the detonation time delay can be set anywhere between 3 seconds and 10 seconds.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! colspan="7" | Depth charge characteristics

There is almost no practical reason to use depth charges on any naval vessel in the game. Although they usually result in a one-hit kill if used properly, they are extremely situational, requiring the player to close to point-blank ranges to even use them. In almost every case, anytime a depth charge could be used, the guns or torpedoes can be used instead to greater effect. In fact, depth charges tend to actually be a liability in battle, since they essentially act as exposed ammo racks before they're dropped. They can be shot at, and if destroyed, they have a chance to detonate, instantly destroying the boat.

Despite this, some success can be had in dropping them either next to, or in front of a large, slow target. If dropping them next to the target, remember the depth charge drop order, since it's most likely that only the depth charges dropped on the side closest to the enemy will deal any damage. If dropping in front of the target, rush in from the sides as quickly as possible and drop them all at once directly in front of the target. For both cases, set the depth charge time delay to the minimum 3 seconds, since any higher time delay will only allow the depth charge to sink further away from the target, giving them more time to move out of the way. Again, using depth charges is extremely situational, and they will only be a liability the vast majority of the time, so take them at your own discretion.

'''Mines'''

[[File:{{PAGENAME}}_Mine_Order.png|thumb|Type M Mk I mines numbered according to their drop order.]]

The Type M Mk I mines are carried one on the stern and four amidships between the funnel and the aft gun mount, two on each side. They are dropped in the following order:

# Stern
# Port, foremost
# Port, aftmost
# Starboard, foremost
# Starboard, aftmost

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"

Like depth charges, naval mines are situational weapons that act like exposed ammunition racks if not dropped. However, because they do not automatically detonate, they are much more useful. With mines, Fairmile A (ML100) can play a utility role by using the mines to cut off narrow passageways and block capture points, then returning back to a friendly capture points to reload before repeating the process. This playstyle is still very situational, though, as it requires misplay on the enemy's part. Mines have a marker in all gamemodes an enemy players will receive a warning when too close to one, so most players will destroy the mines with gunfire or will simply sail around them. Additionally, mines will also despawn after some period of time, so complete coverage of the entire map is not possible. This playstyle also forces Fairmile A (ML100) to the front lines, which is undesirable due to her poor gun armament.

Alternatively, mines can also be used in a more proactive role, essentially like a better depth charge as described above, since they have no detonation time delay and have a much larger explosive charge. If using them like this, remember the drop order; it is not the same as the depth charge drop order. All said, mines are still only situationally useful, so take them based on personal preference.

Fairmile A (ML100)'s primary armament — a single 3 pdr QF Hotchkiss cannon — is rather poor. It's a single-shot cannon and, while it is fairly average compared to similar weapons, all single-shot cannons at this calibre have incredibly poor damage output and will be outperformed by almost any automatic weapon. The gun's accuracy also is unreliable, and, combined with the low muzzle velocity, hitting moving targets beyond about 1.5 km can be difficult. Additionally, the gun is mounted on the stern which only further reduces its versatility. Unfortunately, the secondary armament doesn't fare much better. Because of their arrangement, only two of the four twin mounts can be brought to bear at once. This essentially limits Fairmile A (ML100) to only half that of {{Specs-Link|uk_mtb_1series}}, whose armament wasn't very outstanding to begin with. Like the 3 pdr QF Hotchkiss, the 7.72 mm Lewis 1916 machine guns are themselves plagued by poor damage output and a low maximum range. Even so, with only four of them on target, their damage output actually ends up being better than the 3 pdr cannon, so primarily use the machine guns and only switch to the cannon if they get knocked out.

Because of the bad damage output, Fairmile A (ML100) will feel much less survivable compared to other similar vessels, despite actually having a larger crew. Ironically, the greatest determining factor of a vessel's survivability is actually its firepower rather than any direct defensive quality. Fairmile A (ML100) is simply unable to destroy enemies as quickly as others can and will thus be subject to enemy fire for longer periods of time. Because of this, it is especially important to maximize damage output when playing Fairmile A (ML100). Only fire when you know the shots will land and prioritize disabling enemy weaponry. Additionally, the reloads are quite long, so be proactive with the reloads by firing off any remaining ammunition after engagements.

Like MTB-1 1 series or anything else armed with low-calibre machine guns, Fairmile A (ML100) is best played at close ranges to negate the guns' range disadvantage. Unlike those though, Fairmile A (ML100) lacks the firepower necessary to stay on the front line, so try to stay on the sides and make use of cover as much as possible. From there, play a supporting role by ambushing enemies distracted by your teammates. Whenever possible, only fire at enemies you know you can take out to avoid drawing any unnecessary attention to yourself. For example, any vessels with armour whatsoever will be practically immune to both the machine guns and the cannon, so if you come up against such opponents, as long as they don't notice you, it's best to just mark them on the map for your team, call artillery, and then simply let them pass.

In early 1939, Noel Macklin, a British industrialist, first became aware of the Royal Navy's lack of anti-submarine craft through an article by Vice-Admiral Cecil Vivian Usborne. Realizing the growing danger of German U-boats, and because the Royal Navy was already stretched thin as it was, Usborne advised the Admiralty to adopt a vast fleet of anti-submarine boats to counter the threat. This, however, was largely dismissed by the Admiralty, and in response, Macklin devised his own plan to manufacture the boats. Under his plan, prefabricated parts, built as near to completion as possible, would be sent in kit form ready for final assembly and fitting to the many minor boatbuilding companies throughout the country. This would allow parts and materials to be sourced from companies with no boatbuilding experience and assembled by unskilled labour at unutilized boatyards. Under this decentralized system, the boats could be manufactured quicker and cheaper than had they been manufactured at a single yard, all the while without straining major boatbuilding companies — such as Vospers, British Power Boat Co., White, or Thornycroft — which were all vital in producing specialized, high-speed MTBs and MGBs. Macklin met with Usborne in May 1939 to discuss his idea, and together, they immediately began assembling a team of naval engineers and designers, founding the Fairmile Marine Company. Fairmile quickly produced a wooden motor launch design and proposed the idea to the Admiralty. Ultimately, though, the Admiralty declined to make an order. Nevertheless, convinced in the idea, Fairmile proceeded to produce a prototype as a private venture.

The prototype was ordered from Woodnutt & Co. at St Helens, Isle of Wight, on 27th July 1939 and was laid down on 29th October 1939. It had a hard chine hull and had a length overall of 110 ft, a beam of 17 ft 5 in, a draught of 4 ft 6 in, and a displacement of around 57 tons. It was powered by three Hall-Scott Defender petrol engines, each producing 600 bhp each, allowing it to achieve a top speed of 25 knots. At this time, with the prospect of war approaching ever closer, the Admiralty had no choice but to acknowledge the serious submarine threat and reconsidered Macklin's proposal. While the prototype was still under construction, the Admiralty purchased it in the summer of 1939. This order was followed by another on 22nd September 1939 for an additional 24 boats, although this was later revised to 11 Fairmile designs — the Fairmile A type — and 13 boats of a new Admiralty design — the Fairmile B type. The twelve Fairmile A motor launches were built by ten different companies and were all completed between May and June 1940, all twelve entering service shortly thereafter as MLs 100-111.

Interestingly, the Fairmile A types were ordered by the Admiralty without a specified armament. As such, the decks of the boats were not built to take heavy mounting equipment. As a stopgap measure, it was decided that they should be armed with a single aft QF 3-pdr Hotchkiss cannon and several twin Lewis gun pintle mounts, with one on the bow and a pair of mounts amidships. For hunting U-boats, the boats were given ASDIC equipment and depth charge racks, one on each side, capable of carrying up to six depth charges each. Early into service, the boats also received a Holman projector which was mounted amidships. In their first months at war, the Fairmile A types hunted U-boats and protected convoys in British coastal waters.

Throughout their service, though, the Fairmile A types were plagued by their handling issues and short operational range. By 1941, with the superior Fairmile B type motor launches already in service, any surviving Fairmile A types were converted into minelayers, their depth charge racks replaced with mine racks capable of carrying either six bottom mines or nine moored mines. The 3-pdr Hotchkiss was relocated to the bow with twin 0.5 in Vickers machinegun Mark IV mount added in its place. As minelayers, their funnels were also removed, exhaust rerouted out through the sides instead. In 1943, the Fairmile A types received an upgrade in the form of a single 20 mm Oerlikon cannon in place of the removed funnel and an aft twin 20 mm Oerlikon Mark IX mount. By 1945, any surviving Fairmile A types were converted once again, this time into anti-submarine escorts. As part of this conversion, they received depth charge racks, a Y-gun depth charge thrower, Type 291 radar, and two 2-inch rocket flare launchers. After the end of the war, the surviving Fairmile A types were put into reserve and were all eventually sold between 1947 and 1948.

As the prototype, ML-100 was the first of the Fairmile A types to be built. She was ordered from Woodnutt & Co. at St Helens on 27th July 1939, laid down on 29th October 1939, and completed on 19th May 1940. From 1940 to 1941, ML-100 was based at HMS Midge, Great Yarmouth and performed anti-submarine escort duties around Grisby. In either late 1941 or early 1942, ML-100 was converted for minelaying operations and was transferred to the 51st ML Flotilla based at HMS Beehive, Felixstowe. She was commanded by the following:

* T/Lt. F.E.R. Merritt, RNZNVR: October 1942 to December 1943
* T/Lt. G.A. Wright, RCNVR: February 1944 to April 1944
* T/S.Lt. J.E. Branch, RNVR: June 1944 to October 1944
* T/Lt. E.C. Mercer, RNVR: March 1945 to July 1945

ML-100 survived the war and was sold in October 1947.
