== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the British fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|2pdr QF Mk.IIc (40 mm)|2pdr Rolls Royce (40 mm)}}

The primary armament is composed of two 40 mm guns, an aft-mounted 2 pdr Rolls Royce cannon with 1,200 rounds of ammunition and a bow-mounted 2pdr QF Mk.IIc automatic cannon with 1,120 rounds of ammunition. The aft gun has a magazine capacity of 4 rounds and a reload of 2.21 seconds with a stock crew, when used with an ace crew the reload is 1.7 seconds. The bow gun has a belt capacity of 56 rounds and a reload of 7.8 seconds with a stock crew, an ace crew can reload the gun in 6 seconds.

There are three ammunition choices available:

* '''Universal:''' {{Annotation|HEF|High-explosive fragmentation}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF|High-explosive fragmentation}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}
* '''40 mm HE:''' {{Annotation|HEF|High-explosive fragmentation}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF|High-explosive fragmentation}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF|High-explosive fragmentation}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}
* '''40 mm AP:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF|High-explosive fragmentation}}

{{:2pdr QF Mk.IIc (40 mm)/Ammunition|HEF, AP-T}}

The best ammunition for general use is the 40 mm HE belt, with its higher concentration of HE over the other belts. It is the most effective against lightly armoured boats and aircraft. To deal with armoured targets, a large amount of the 40 mm AP belt should also be carried. Due to the long reload of the bow gun it may be advisable to try to engage targets with the aft gun when reloading or switching belts. Alternatively you may want to use the universal belt which trades damage output for more armour-piercing rounds, with this belt you will not need to reload when engaging armoured targets.

The bow gun has a total of 600 rounds of ammo in 10 belts of 60 rounds each and the aft gun has a total of 40 rounds of ammunition in 10 magazines of 4 rounds each. Because of this you should currently not rely on the aft gun for engaging targets.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
{{main|Vickers Mk.V (12.7 mm)}}

''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.''

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
{{main|Vickers GO No.5 (7.7 mm)}}

''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.''

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
{{main|Mk.VII depth charge}}

''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.''

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Fairmile C (312) has a low survivability and an average mobility. The 40 mm guns are not suited for long range engagements, however they are efficient at taking out anything smaller than a destroyer.

Once the battle starts seek cover halfway between the spawn and the closest strategic point, angled cover that exposes your frontal 40 mm guns but covers the hull is ideal (usually rocks or sand beach). Stay close to that cover since it prevents guns with high muzzle velocity from easily shooting at you, but allows your low muzzle velocity guns to shoot. However, this static gameplay makes you vulnerable to artillery strikes and high altitude bombers, but it should be a rare occurrence. You can contribute to the battle this way by denying an area to enemy movement. If you need to move, try to do it as part of a group, since any motorboat can easily take you out in a short amount of time, all while being very hard to hit with the 40 mm guns. Using the 12.7 mm MGs works better for those close range situations but forces you to expose your side making you an even bigger target.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Low muzzle velocity of the 2 x 40 mm guns gives it good shell arc, allowing it to engage targets behind cover
* The turrets with twin 12.7 mm guns are effective versus aircraft and fast-moving boats

'''Cons:'''

* Low survivability
* The 40 mm 2pdr QF Mk.IIc cannon is the only forward-facing gun and has a long reload time
* Using both 40 mm guns exposes its side, making it vulnerable to total crew knock-out
* No torpedoes

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
