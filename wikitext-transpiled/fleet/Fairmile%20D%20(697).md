== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the British fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
All around, the Fairmile D (697) has the same survivability as the other Fairmiles. The boat is protected with thin wooden structure and all HE shells 40 mm calibre upwards will wipe out the Fairmile D with ease. If you see even a small burst of shells heading to your way, you know the bottom awaits at that point.

Crew size of 30 doesn't help much either, as most of them tend to get wiped from the first hits to the boat's wooden structure.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Mobility is comparable to other Fairmiles. For such a streamlined build, the Fairmile D (697) is rather slow and tends to be the last on the cap if compared to other similar boats such as the S-boats or PTs.

Like the other Fairmiles, the Fairmile D (697) is somewhat responsive when switching between reverse and forward. There is a delay, like with all boats, so getting accustomed to this is recommended. Long build of the boat and sluggishness affects the turning with unfavourable results, and it is recommended to not end up in tight or narrow spaces.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

As the Fairmile D (697) sits at rank V, its RP cost for most of the modules is between 9,000 to 16,000 research points.

RP boosters, premium account or talisman won't make spading the vehicle any easier than gaining any points in match with this ship is really hard to due to the boat's awful survivability and subpar armament.

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|6pdr 7cwt QF Mk IIA (57 mm)}}

The Fairmile D (697) is armed with two 6pdr 7cwt QF Mk IIA (57 mm) guns, one on the front and one on the rear. These guns pose a mediocre fire rate with mediocre shell velocity and are far inferior to 40 mm Bofors for example. 57 mm guns are only capable of firing HE so dealing with armoured targets is out of its league, but can reliably hit larger vessels up to a 3.5 kilometres away.

Focus on lightly armoured and small wooden vessels with these guns.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mark V (20 mm)}}

Positioned awkwardly in the middle of the boat, the dual 20 mm Oerlikon is made to fend off small boats which might get too close for the 57 mm guns to be effective. Although, this requires some manoeuvring and effective positioning. The 20 mm can also work as extra AA armament.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Vickers Mk.V (12.7 mm)|Vickers GO No.5 (7.7 mm)}}

Marginally bad 7.7 mm Vickers AA guns have terrible horizontal traverse, so you can forget them as an anti-aircraft guns, and also the damage dealt to enemy ships with them is quite minimal.

12.7 mm Vickers Mk.V heavy machine guns are excellent weapons for anti-aircraft purpose for planes that are in proximity, but keep in mind that if the plane is already close, it means you are probably dead in few seconds. Fire rate and damage is decent enough to deal with smaller non-armoured boats with lower battle rating. Boats such as LS-3s and Pr.123s are still common sight, so taking control of your AA weaponry is recommended in naval CQB.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|18 inch Mark XV (450 mm)|Mk.VII depth charge}}

Like some Fairmiles, the Fairmile D is armed with the common British Four 18" Mark XV torpedoes. These torpedoes have slow speed of 54 km/h and range of only 5 km with the torpedo mode modification installed.

Mk.VII depth charge is a depth charge. You'll might get a kill with them in one game out of a hundred if someone is foolish enough to sail too close of you, but due to the survivability of the Fairmile D,  sailing close to the enemy and using the depth charges with purpose is not recommended.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Try to find cover or a small island. Use your reverse and forward speed to peek. Unload a burst of 57 mm HE shells from range and reverse back to cover. Keep your eyes open for possible targets and avoid heavily armoured Russian patrol boats like the MBKs at all cost. Look for weak or half-dead opponents, as they are the only prey you can feast upon with the Fairmile D's underwhelming armament.

If taking cover is not possible in the map: stay on the move and try to avoid fire and enemies, as the Fairmile D tends to lose against everything due to its awful survivability. Try to hit enemies on the move with the 57 mm guns. Overall, avoid sharp turns and combat against multiple enemies in the same time.

Only engage in combat with Fairmile D (697) when you know that you have a sure shot, upper hand, or you are facing a weaker opponent.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 12.7 mm Vickers are decent against planes and smaller boats

'''Cons:'''

* Wooden structure and no reliable armour means that your survivability in all sorts of engagements is abysmal
* Armament is subpar when compared to other Fairmiles armed with 40 mm Bofors
* QF 57 mm are capable of firing only HE and can't deal with boats with armour
* 105 mm or larger HE shells will knock out the Fairmile D (697) instantly

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
