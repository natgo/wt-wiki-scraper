== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
While the Valentine turret itself is armoured and that has some utility, the magazines beneath it are not, nor is anything else on the ship. Moderate size and amounts of open space have marginal utility, but other peers survive on mobility.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The boat's mobility is very poor, with such a low top speed, the mediocre acceleration (~19 seconds to top speed, ~16 seconds to stop, ~26 seconds to reverse from full speed) doesn't even allow a user of this boat to reverse out of danger quickly, nor does the turning radius. It is likely any positioning mistakes will be punished greatly. There isn't a saving grace, but if there was one it would be relative stability at flank speed.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|6pdr QF Mk.V (57 mm)}}

The 6pdr gun has unique access in the coastal tree to armour-piercing rounds. While the HE rounds have minimal effectiveness, mostly due to the low rate of fire (most other 6pdr guns in the coastal tree are semi-automatic), be sure to utilize the AP capability to the maximum, hitting vital modules and tougher targets.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mark V (20 mm)}}
The two 20 mm cannons have limited utility against ships, but are useful in an AA role.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Vickers Mk.V (12.7 mm)}}
The two .50 cal machine guns are almost no use on their own, but combined with the 20 mm cannons, they're useful in an AA role, though their range is minimal.

=== Special armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Special}}
<!-- ''Mortars, mines, rocket launchers and missiles are also effective in skilled hands and can take an off-guard opponent by surprise. Evaluate the ammunition of this type of armament and rate its performance in combat. If there are no special armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Ordnance ML 4.2-inch mortar}}
The 4.2-inch mortar is practically useless, stuck to a 1 km firing range, taking 15s to reach its target and an extra 1s to explode, and doing minimal damage when it arrives.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Due to the slow speed and armour, trying to stick with the team is important. If you're in trouble or make a positioning mistake, low speed will give opponents plenty of opportunity to punish users of this vehicle. Soviet armoured boats can be tough for the rest of the team to deal with, having armour to stay protected with good enough mobility to avoid being hit by torpedoes, so be on the lookout for those. Also consider taking the role of an "AA barge," targeting aircraft outside 45° either side of the bow, even the 20 mm turrets can have difficulty targeting aircraft in the forward arc. Dashing from cover to cover is key in any boat, but taking the most efficient path is necessary to survival in such a slow boat. Consider choosing the right moment with support before moving out of cover. Utilize sight lines to the maximum and consider going for close-range ambushes. The boat's effectiveness at close range but inability to close that range easily make it a tricky one to play well.

Against Soviet armoured boats, the [[Pr.191]], [[Pr.191M]], and [[Pr.1124 early]], and [[Pr.1124 late]], knock out the turrets then proceed to the magazines or bridge. Against the [[MBK pr.186]] or [[MBK-161 late]] or similar heavier boats, you'll need a near enough point-blank and square shot on the side of the turrets to knock them out. Consider hitting the magazines, above the waterline but below the turrets. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* The primary armament, the fore Valentine turret is well armoured
* the 6pdr armour-piercing shell is unique to this boat and effective, able to fire down the length of enemy boats or simply break them apart hitting both sides and going through components, especially against Soviet armoured boats. Just be sure to hit vital components.
* 20 mm mounts and the .50 cals can be surprisingly effective against aircraft, especially outside the front 45 degree arc

'''Cons:'''

* Painfully slow speed, and its turning radius is mediocre
* With no armour outside the Valentine turret, the magazines are somewhat vulnerable
* 4.2-inch mortar is useless, stuck to a 1 km range though potshots may yield minimal results
* Valentine turret traverse speed is poor
