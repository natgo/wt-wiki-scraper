== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The RN Folaga (C 16) entered service on 16 February 1943 and operated with the Squadriglia Corvette, 7° Gruppo AS. under the Regia Marina. Before the Italian armistice, the RN Folaga escorted convoys, performed air defence duties, and engaged enemy submarine units in the Upper Tyrrhenian Sea. After the armistice, it was used by the Italian Co-Belligerent Navy mainly in escort missions. After WW2, the RN Folaga (C 16) would be used with the 2°Gruppo Dragaggio and 5°Gruppo Dragaggio from Venice for naval mine removal operations across almost all of the Italian territorial waters. Later, it was put under works in which its armament was changed, and it was renamed to Folaga F-576 under NATO nomenclature. In 1953, it ended its service at the Commando School and was used for training activities. In 1965, the Folaga F-576 was disarmed pending decommission, due to the Decree of the President of the Republic dated 1st August 1965.

Introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]], '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''' is an excellent premium corvette to research the Italian coastal tech tree. Thanks to its upgraded armament with a 40 mm twin tower Bofors and the radar, you can destroy almost all the ships you meet and also enemy planes easily thanks to the radar lock that tells you how to aim. In comparison to the [[RN Gabbiano]], the Folaga is much better only because of the 40 mm guns and radar, while top speed, manoeuvrability, torpedoes, and depth charges are equal, so they are much better to use at a distance or in areas well protected from enemy torpedoes and depth charges.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Folaga F-576 is a ship with extraordinary survivability, difficult to shoot down by enemy coastal ships and aircraft, the 112 crew can quickly repair the ship when it is disabled as it is difficult to do much damage to it and sink it directly, however against destroyers equipped with SAP or AP with more powerful penetrative capabilities, able to destroy in one it in your ammo rack you easily but most of the enemies you will encounter will struggle to destroy you.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The ship's top speed of 33 km/h is not very good due to its electric motors, good acceleration and manoeuvrability, but due to the low speed, you will struggle to dodge enemy hits and torpedoes.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|100 mm/47 O.T.O. Mod. 1937 (100 mm)}}

The main armament of the Folaga is composed of a single 100 mm/47 OTO Mod.1937 cannon placed in front, this cannon gives the Folaga the ability to damage enemy destroyers more easily thanks to its APHE and HE, capable of destroying enemy ship's components and diminishing the crew of the enemy ship, while for the anti-aircraft role, captains could use the HE-FT but it is not recommended due to the reloading and speed of the cannon to turn on itself.

If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 1 (40 mm)}}

The secondary armament is composed of a twin 40 mm Bofors L/60 positioned behind the ship, these cannons are the strong point of this ship, thanks to which you can destroy enemy boats easily and continuously damage destroy destroyers, however, if you want to use them for the anti-aircraft role you can also count on the radar in possession of the Folaga that will make it much easier to destroy enemy aircraft.

{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Scotti-Isotta Fraschini mod.1939 (20 mm)}}

The anti-aircraft armament consists of two single 20 mm/70 Scotti-Isotta Fraschini Mod.1939 placed on either side of the deck, perfect for destroying boats and air targets, they have a good reload and a great ability to cause damage to light targets.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I.170/450X5,25 (450 mm)|WBG depth charge}}

The additional armament on the Folaga consists of two single 450 mm torpedo launchers placed on the sides of the ship and six depth charge launchers also placed on the sides, the torpedoes are always good for destroying enemy destroyers while the depth charges will be difficult to use unless you are very close to the enemy ship.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Folaga F-576 proves to be a good ship thanks to its very good armament, the main 100 mm cannon you will use very little against small enemy targets, instead the armament that you will use the most of all is the twin 40 mm Bofors tower that gives you a big advantage in firepower capable of destroying both coastal targets, aircraft and destroyers, thanks to its rate of fire, armour piercing bullets and the radar on the ship you can do anything with the 40 mm Bofors, the anti-aircraft armament is a bit weaker but still useful for destroying coastal ships such as torpedo boats and also aircraft, in the game try to position yourself in a difficult to reach area such as torpedo boats for the simple fact that you are quite slow and for this reason, they could quickly destroy you with torpedoes or depth charges so find a good position, then for large targets such as destroyers use the torpedoes in your possession aiming at the hold of the enemy ship.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

==== WW2 - RN Folaga (C 16) ====
The RN Folaga (C 16) was delivered to the Regia Marina Italiana and commissioned on 16 February 1943, assigned to the Squadriglia Corvette, she underwent intense training at La Spezia in the spring, and after the training was over, she was repositioned at La Maddalena under the 7° Gruppo Anti-Sommergibile (7°Gruppo A.S.). Before the Italian armistice, she carried out 11 convoy escorts, fire actions against enemy aircraft, and 44 searches of enemy aircraft and enemy underwater units in the Upper Tyrrhenian Sea.

After the armistice of 8 September 1943 when she was in La Spezia, she moved under the new command of the Italian Co-Belligerent to Portoferraio, and left on 10 September, with the twin corvettes RN Ape (C 25) and RN Cormorano (C 13) for a mission to Bastia, where during the navigation they encountered 5 German Motozattere, against which they opened fire, sinking one and damaging the others, after this combat they continued the navigation until reaching Palermo, then under armistice dispositions she was redeployed to Augusta and then Taranto, from October 1943 until the end of the war, she did mainly escort missions to allied convoys in southern Italian waters between Augusta, Naples and the Adriatic, making connections and transports along the Tyrrhenian coast to make up for the deficient conditions of rail traffic.

==== After the war - Folaga (F-576) ====
In the post-war period, the RN Folaga (C 16) was used on missions to clear national waters of naval mines depending on the 2°Gruppo Dragaggio, the areas in which she operated in 1946 were the coasts from Civitavecchia to Naples and in 1947-1948 in the waters of Argentario, Elba and Livorno, in the winter of 1948-1949 its activities were limited, consisting of local training sessions with students from the Livorno Naval Academy, in April it began dredging Sardinian waters from Cagliari, and finally in November 1949 it operated in the Upper Adriatic and front of Grado, depending on the 5°Gruppo Dragaggio in Venice.

During the first few years after the war, the RN Folaga (C 16) was put under various workings, after which she was renamed Folaga F-576, for about a year she carried out various activities in the waters of La Spezia, and then she passed to Maridipart, Naples as a departmental ship, with increasingly reduced activity, in 1953 she was assigned to the Command School.

==== Destiny ====
After four months of work at the Taranto Arsenal, she was placed in Augusta for training activities, and in 1965 the Folaga F-576 was laid up awaiting decommissioning, due to the Presidential Decree of 1 August 1965.
