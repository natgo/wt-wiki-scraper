== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
Between the 1950s and '70s, the Italian Navy was experimenting with particular gunboats whose armament and configuration could be quickly changed. These boats would be called convertible gunboats (''motoconvertibili''), going from the [[MC-490]] to the Lampo class and finally the [[MC Freccia (Family)|Freccia class]]. The P-493 Freccia was the first boat of the Freccia class, laid down in 30 April 1963, launched 9 January 1965 and finally commissioned 6 July 1965. It was tested and used in different configurations to improve any problems for the next convertible torpedo boat of the same class, ran a few exercises with the various configurations, and was joined by the [[Saetta P-494|P-494 Saetta]] in 1966. It did not do much in service, and after the failure of the convertible torpedo boats it was disarmed in 15 September 1984, and later decommissioned on 15 February 1985.

The P-493 Freccia was added with the [[wt:en/news/6808-special-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-2020-en|Operation S.U.M.M.E.R. 2020]] event during [[Update "Starfighters"]]. The ship has two configurations: gunboat and torpedo boat. The first configuration gives you access to three 40 mm Breda-Bofors cannons which are very useful against most targets (coastal ships and aircraft) but have limited use against heavier targets such as destroyers and cruisers, while the second configuration gives you access to two 40 mm Breda-Bofors and two 533 mm torpedo launchers which can be very useful against destroyers and cruisers.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The only armour on this vehicle surrounds the main cannons, which can be useful for keeping the guns operational when coming under fire. However, the rest of the vehicle has no armour protection.

The Freccia can survive a number of hits when dealing with gunboats, but higher-calibre cannons such as those on destroyers will have no trouble sinking it.

The hull of the vessel is made up of 8 mm of steel, and the superstructure is made up of 4 mm of steel.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The ship has good speed for its size, but lacks manoeuvrability.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|40 mm/70 Breda-Bofors (40 mm)}}

The main armament on the Freccia are 40 mm/70 Breda-Bofors type 107 cannons, one at the bow and one at the stern, as well as the option of an additional cannon amidships by sacrificing the torpedoes. These guns have access to two ammunition belt types, High Explosive Fragmentation Incendiary Tracers belts or High Explosive Variable Time Fuse belts, the latter of which has a 7 m trigger radius making it quite useful for dealing with enemy aircraft, especially when they are at relatively close range.

The turrets have a full 360° arc of horizontal rotation and traverse at 95°/second, certainly fast enough to keep up with most surface and air targets. These guns are protected by some armour which will aid in keeping them operational against enemy fire, although this is the only armour on the whole vessel.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 270/533X6.84 Tipo L (533 mm)}}

The Freccia P-493 can be equipped with a pair of torpedoes sporting a warhead of 270 kg of TNT, a maximum range of 8 km, and a speed of 81 km/h.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
With its powerful 40 mm cannons, the Freccia can shred most enemy boats. However, it lacks armour and since the cannons have difficulty damaging most bluewater ships, it is better to stay in the coastal areas of the map. Carrying torpedoes reduces the firepower against boats, but it will make it viable to kill destroyers since the torpedoes deal decent amounts of damage. The 40 mm cannons have HE-VT rounds so the Freccia can kill most planes without problem. Noteworthy enemies are the Pr. 206 and its variants: MPK Pr.12412, SKR-7, and also the Saetta since those ships can deal massive amounts of damage to small boats.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Incredible firepower with 3 x 40 mm autocannons
* Decent speed

'''Cons:'''

* Poor survivability
* Not suited for fighting destroyers
* Not suited for long range combat with its cannons
* No armour

{{main|MC Freccia (Family)|l1=History of the Motocovertibile Classe Freccia}}

The patrol boat P-493 Freccia is the first ship of the MC Freccia class. It was built at the Riva Trigoso shipyard (CNR Riva Trigoso).

The unit was laid down on April 30, 1963 as MC590, and was launched on January 9, 1965, entering service on July 6 of that year. On September 1, it was renamed Freccia with pennant number Patrol boat P-493.

The Freccia P-493 was followed by the [[Saetta P-494]] completed on April 25, 1966, and the never completed Dardo P-495.

Disarmed on September 15, 1984, she was decommissioned on February 15, 1985.
