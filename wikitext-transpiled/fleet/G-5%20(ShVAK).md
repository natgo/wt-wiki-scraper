== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the fleet release into open beta test. This is a nice modification to the regular reserve version. The 20 mm cannon has good fire rate and good penetration.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The G-5 ShVAK has no armour in its overall design, to the point where the only armour is the bulletproof glass on the windows of the bridge, which provides 5 mm of protection! As such, any small arms armament can penetrate and destroy critical modules and knock out crew members. The G-5 carries a crew complement of six, all located around the conning tower of the ship, meaning any well-placed shots with high explosive rounds or concentration of fire on this area can see all the crew members knocked out and the ship destroyed!

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
In Arcade battles, the ship can reach its top speed of 132 km/h within 14.9 seconds, and in Realistic & Simulator, it can reach up to 94 km/h within 14.3 seconds. The reverse speeds can reach up to an impressive 62 km/h! Its small size, combined with its breakneck speed and manoeuvrability, creates a highly agile ship.

{{main|ShVAK (20 mm)}}

The 20 mm ShVAK cannon is a truly menacing tool, it provides great destructive capabilities over the enemy vehicles, whether it be aerial or naval targets which are met in battle. The cannon is placed at the rear of the conning tower, and provides great defensive and offensive capabilities for the ship. However, the ShVAK is unable to provide any stopping power when enemy ships are in front of it due to the ship commander is placed in front, along with the ship radio mask which prevents the cannon from being lowered. It takes between 5.85 and 4.5 seconds to reload this in game - 4.5 second time is achieved with a fully qualified & upgraded crew.

The 20 mm ShVAK cannon has three choices of ammunition: Universal, HE (high-explosive), and AP (armour-piercing). Each ammunition has a unique belt that defines how the rounds are loaded into the gun.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-38 (533 mm)}}

The G-5 ShaVAK has two [[53-38]] torpedoes, placed in the rear of the ship. When these are launched from the ship, they are ejected backwards into the water and then submerse under the ship. These torpedoes are able to take down any ship in the game with well-placed & calculated shots.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The G-5 ShVAK is a fast and manoeuvrable ship, with speeds up to 122 km/h in Arcade and 94 km/h in Realistic & Simulator Battles. The G-5 ShVAK also offers excellent manoeuvrability at high speeds compared to its competitors, such as the PT, LS, and others. Additionally, the G-5 ShVAK is armed with a 20 mm cannon; not all rivals have cannons or machine guns. The G-5 ShVAK is one of the fastest vessels in the game, almost twice as fast as other vessels similar in its class. As such, it is best utilized to capture points early, providing cover to allies with a smokescreen, and sneaking around enemies and ambushing them with hit-and-run tactics with its slightly faster and accurate torpedoes.

When playing the G-5 ShVAK in Arcade battles, it is crucial to be aware of your teammates - since most vessels travel at high speed, it is not impossible for your teammates to accidentally collide into you. When this happens, the G-5 is a small and lightweight vessel, and when they clash in the heat of battle, they can flip you over, and you drown.

In battle, whether it is Arcade, Realistic or Simulator, the G-5 ShVAK can be compared to a piranha; it's small, highly agile, resilient, and very fast, making it unstoppable in the hands of a skilled player. When engaging enemy ships, turn the G-5 into them, keeping G-5 profile, very small, and hard to hit. Using the tremendous high speed and manoeuvrability offered, bring the ship alongside and blast them with the ShVAK 20 mm cannon.

It is essential to make every shot count, do not aim for open spaces, aim for areas such as the bridge and engine room where the rounds from the G-5 will be able to cause a lot of damage to critical parts and knocking out sailors on the enemy vessel.

The ShVAK cannon armament, while relatively potent at close-range, is wildly inaccurate at longer ranges. Especially while travelling at or near top speeds, with no modern stabilizer of any kind, the ShVAK is subject to bouncing over the waves, making long-distance shots very difficult. As such, the armament is most effective at short to medium-ranges (100-300 m). The HE belt, with three fragmentation/incendiary-tracer & fragmentation/incendiary rounds to every one AP round, will be the most effective belt against smaller vessels, as they typically have little to no armour, making penetration not terribly important. Against medium to large-sized vessels or a smaller ship with a thick hull, the AP belt, with three AP/AP-I rounds for every one FI-T round, will be most effective. Given its role as a short-to-medium range brawler, though, one should consider taking mostly HE belts, with only a few AP belts, as the likelihood of engaging a well-armoured vessel at this BR is relatively low. That being said, consideration should also be given to the possibility of facing certain other Soviet or Japanese vessels, as some of these do indeed sport relatively thick armour. Larger vessels should ideally be engaged with the torpedoes.

The G-5's torpedoes are more suited to be used against bigger, slower, and less manoeuvrable ships such as the [[BMO]], [[PC-451]], [[SF40 Light]], [[HMS Liscomb]], [[Type K-3 No.1]] and other types which are similar to these. However, it is not impossible to use the torpedoes on smaller targets.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great top speed
* Great manoeuvrability
* 20 mm ShVAK cannon packs a more powerful punch than the DShK machine gun
* As with all PT boats, wields powerful torpedoes
* Torpedoes are stored internally, making it difficult to spot a launch
* Long range torpedoes (10 km)

'''Cons:'''

* No armour
* Low ammunition capacity for the ShVAK; can run out of ammo quickly if not properly handled.
* Inadequate gun elevation and transverse

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
This is one of the probable modifications of the original G-5 ship, since there is little to none historical data to prove it. Already using an engine from the aircraft, it is possible that one was modified with the 20 mm cannon. Standard armament on these patrol boats was a single 7.62 mm (0.300 in) machine gun, which was later upgraded to one or two 12.7 mm (0.50 in) DShK machine guns in different mounts.
