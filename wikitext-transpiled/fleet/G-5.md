== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''G-5''' Motor Torpedo Boat represented a significant evolution from the Sh-4 MTB both before and during WW2. It underwent numerous variations and modifications, with approximately 300 units produced during the war. Initially armed with a single 7.62 mm machine gun and two torpedoes, it was later upgraded to incorporate a 12.7 mm DShK machine gun in subsequent modifications. Throughout the war, the G-5 underwent extensive alterations. Some of these included configurations with dual 12.7 mm DShK machine guns, a single 20 mm ShVAK autocannon ([[G-5 (ShVAK)]]), or, in certain variations, an 82 mm M-8 Rocket Launcher, often at the expense of the torpedo launcher ([[TKA-106]]).

The boat was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game. Its armament consists of a single 12.7 mm DShK machine gun and two 533 mm 53-38 torpedoes. Like many other reserve MTBs, engagements primarily rely on the gun armament, occasionally utilizing torpedoes for slower, heavier vessels. Being the fastest MTB at its BR, it excels in swiftly capturing strategic points and mounting surprise attacks on the enemy.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

[[File:X-RayImage StarboardView G-5.png|thumb|Profile shot of the G-5. The two engines sit at the bow and ammunition storage is tucked behind the bridge where the turret is.]]
The G-5 has no armour in its overall design, to the point where the only armour is the armoured glass, which provides 5 mm of protection located on the windows of the bridge. As such, any small arms armament can penetrate and destroy, critical modules and knock out crew members. The G-5 carries a crew complement of six, which are all located around the conning tower of the ship. Meaning, any well-placed shots with high explosive rounds or concentration of fire on this area, can see all the crew members knocked out and the ship destroyed!

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
In Arcade battles the ship can reach its top speed of 132 km/h within 14.9 seconds and in Realistic & Simulator it can reach up to 94 km/h within 14.3 seconds.
The Reverse speeds can reach up to an impressive 62 km/h! Its small size, combined with its very fast speed, manoeuvrability, creates a highly agile ship.

{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

The only gun on the G-5 is a single 12.7 mm DShK machine gun. It can destroy any motor torpedo boats and some larger boats if you're lucky. Being located in the centre of the vessel, it does have 360 degrees of aiming but is somewhat restricted in depression when pointed towards the bow due to structural designs, meaning it can only be reliably fired at other vessels when aimed at the sides or rear of the ship. You can research two different ammo belts for the 12.7 mm, the high explosive incendiary (HEI) and armour piercing incendiary tracer (APIT) rounds.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-38 (533 mm)}}

The G-5 carries two 533 mm 53-38 torpedoes. They have a range of 4 km at a speed of 82 km/h. With the Torpedo Mode module installed, they can reach 10 km at a reduced speed of 75 km/h. As both torpedoes sit in the aft, pointing towards the bow, they are accurate and easy to aim with.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The G-5 is a fast and manoeuvrable ship, with speeds up to 122 km/h in Arcade and 94 km/h in Realistic & Simulator Battles. The G-5 also offers excellent manoeuvrability, at high speeds compared to it competitors such as the PT, LS and others. The G-5 is one of the fastest vessels in the game, almost twice as fast as other similar vessels in its class.

As such, it is best utilized to capture points early, providing cover to allies with smokescreen, and sneaking around enemies and ambushing them with hit-and-run tactics with its slightly faster and accurate torpedoes.

When playing the G-5 in Arcade battles, it is important to be aware of your teammates - since most vessels travel at high speed, it is not impossible for your teammates to accidentally collide into you. When this happens, the G-5 is a small and lightweight vessel, it is possible when they collide in the heat of battle, that they can flip you over, and you drown.

In battle, the G-5 can be compared to a piranha, its small size, high agility, resilience and being very fast makes it unstoppable in the hands of a skilled player. When engaging enemy ships, turn the G-5 into them, keeping G-5 profile, very small and hard to hit. Using the great high speed manoeuvrability offered, bring the ship close, turn broadside and blast them with the 12.7 mm machine gun.

It is important to make every shot count, do not aim for open spaces, aim for areas such the bridge and engine room where the rounds from the G-5 will be able to cause a lot of damage to critical parts and knocking out sailors on the enemy vessel.

Using the G-5 torpedoes, are more suited to bigger, slower and less manoeuvrable ships such as the following the class of ships: [[BMO]], [[PC-451]], [[SF40 Light]], [[HMS Liscomb]], [[Type K-3 No.1]] and other types which are similar to these. However, it is not impossible to use the torpedoes on smaller & manoeuvrable targets, one of the ways is to out manoeuvre the opponent, and turn into them and launch it allowing the rival to sail into it.

If targeting aircraft: Slow down, get to cover and use the high explosive incendiary (HEI) rounds.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

* Machine gun can carry a surplus of ammunition
* Two torpedoes facing forwards, can help lead to incoming enemies
* Small profile can make it hard to hit from a distance, especially against large-calibre weapons that have a slow fire rate
* Speedy
* Long range torpedoes (10 km)

'''Cons:'''

* Basically no armour
* Only one gun
* Armament cannot fire towards the front except at high elevations
* Machine gun armament has small belt of 50 rounds before reloading
* Front is filled with engines, center filled with other important parts and crew, enemies can easily prioritize targeting for elimination
* Gunner is somewhat exposed due to the lack of a gun shield.

The G-5 motor torpedo boat, produced from 1933 until 1941, was developed from the Sh-4 class of motor torpedo boats. The unarmed prototype model of the G-5, designed in 1932, used imported Italian engines as no satisfactory Soviet engines were yet available. The production model, however, used an adapted Mikulin AM-34 aircraft engine, designated as GAM-34. Its torpedo release system was based off of British WWI-era coastal torpedo boats that were captured during the Russian Civil War. It was also armed with a 7.62 mm machine gun, however, later models were instead fitted with a 12.7 mm machine gun, and it is this iteration of the G-5 that is available as a reserve boat in the USSR naval tech tree. Other variants that were produced included ships that possessed two 12.7 mm machine guns instead of one, and ships that were additionally mounted with ROFS-82 or ROFS-132 rocket launchers. Some even had both (Such as the G-5 TKA 106, available in the USSR's premium naval tech tree). Still others replaced the 12.7 mm machine gun entirely with a 20 mm ShVAK cannon (Such as the premium G-5 (ShVAK), also available in the USSR naval tech tree). Including all variants, an approximate 300 G-5s were built. Despite their classification, they are not known to have been used to torpedo enemy ships very often, instead being relegated for the most part to more standard assignments such as landing units, transports, escorts, and the like. Four were exported to the Spanish Republican Navy for use in the Spanish Civil War, and an additional unknown number to North Korea. They remained in Soviet service until the 1950s.
