== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The GIS 811 was originally laid down in 1943 as PT-388 by Robert Jacob Consolidated Shipyard, City Island, NY, launched and completed in 1944, and delivered to the British Navy as MTB-400 to reinforce patrol, reconnaissance and defence capabilities to Allied naval convoys until the end of WWII. It was later given back to America, who sold her to Italy to help rebuild the Italian flotilla. The Italian Navy later changed the armament, improving it to a 20 mm/65 Breda cannon and a 2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 quad turret, and it served training and patrol missions until 1959 when it was decommissioned.

Introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]], the Vosper 70' GIS 811 is a nimble little coastal boat with highly effective armament that can easily make short work of any other coastal boats it gets its eyes on. It's one of the first boats you'll unlock when playing the Italian naval tree. However, due to how the armament is placed, you need good map knowledge and know how to position yourself to make the most out of the vehicle. This version in game represents one of the early post-war motor torpedo boats the Italian navy had put into service.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Vosper 70' GIS 811 sadly is not very armoured, although it can withstand some machine-gun fire, most naval boats you'll encounter will not need much to take you out. The boat can take some damage if you don't expose yourself entirely, which should give you enough time to either move out of the way or fire back. Enemy aircraft with cannons and bombs also will be a big problem, so try avoid getting hit by them as you dont have much armour when being attacked from the air.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The mobility of the Vosper 70' GIS 811 is very good, although their may be some ships which will slightly be faster you have just enough to usually be in front of most of your team. With this you're able to get to positions or get out of danger when you no longer feel safe. The mobility at times can also be a bit too much and unexperienced players may crash into other ships or beach themselves, thankfully you can regulate the speed of the Vosper 70' GIS 811 if needed.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)|2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 (20 mm)}}

The armament is made up of a single 20mm/65 Breda in the front i.e. the usual Italian 20mm that you find in several Italian torpedo boats and a quad turret with armament 2cm/65 Flakvierling 38 in the back of the boat, the armament, in general, is very good against light rib targets, whose quad turret helps a lot to cause as much damage as possible to enemy boats without having too many problems, for the selection of shots I recommend the standard one for the simple fact that you can penetrate do superficial damage then maximising the damage in both cases.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|W.200/450X5,75 (450 mm)}}The additional armament consists only of two 450mm torpedo launchers, which allow the destruction of tougher targets to destroy such as destroyers, frigates or other ships with good survivability, of course, try to aim the torpedoes at enemy ammo racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->The GIS 811 allows you to quickly reach very good positions to flank the enemy so that you can use all the armament in your possession, always try to position yourself so that you can use all the main armament composed of Italian 20mm and four German 20mm these guns can cause serious damage to enemy coastal ships, while if you find a stronger target with good survivability use torpedoes aiming them at the ammo rack usually under the main towers, remember not to go in frontal because you have little crew and little survival in general because of the hull Vosper is not armoured, you will have some difficulty in shooting down enemy aircraft because they could use rockets and destroy you in one shot, at the end that is also the problem of the tide that makes it difficult to aim in rough water and then you will have to try to hit the enemy the best way possible

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Effective 20 mm guns
* Sufficient AA capability
* Small enough to hide behind rocks, islands, etc
* Torpedoes have a lot of explosive filler
* Capable of destroying other costal boats very quickly
* Sufficient speed and mobility

'''Cons:'''

* Torpedoes have a short range
* Guns are insufficient against bigger boats
* Susceptible to even small arms fire
* Extremely low survivability

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Laid down on 18 August 1943 as '''PT-388''' by the Robert Jacob Consolidated Shipyard, City Island, NY, launched on 17 December 1943, completed on 13 June 1944 and then transferred to the British Navy and renamed HMS '''MTB-400''' it was used for reconnaissance, patrol and escort missions.

After the Second World War it was transferred back to the US Navy on 16 October 1945 then in the following month decommissioned, but this time it was handed over to the State Department, Foreign Liquidation Commission in January 1948, whose motor torpedo boat was purchased by the Italian Navy and transferred on 24 March 1948 and under the peace treaty of World War II renamed '''GIS-001''' and rearmed with new armament with a [[20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)]] and a quad tower with [[2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 (20 mm)]], she was used as a torpedo recovery boat, then immediately renamed '''GIS-811'''.

With the creation of NATO, the peace treaty was no longer valid and with this GIS-811 was redesignated as '''MS-811''' Motor Torpedo Boat then again renamed '''MS-461''', in the last years she would carry out exercises and patrols until 30 June 1959 when she was decommissioned.
