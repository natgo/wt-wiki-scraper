== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The French cruiser '''Guichen''' was originally built as 'RN Scipione Africano', an Italian cruiser of the [[Capitani Romani (Family)|Capitani Romani-class]], before being transferred to France as war reparations. After her launch in January 1941 and commissioning in April 1943, she was sent to Taranto, from where she participated in Operation Scylla, during which she sank a British motor torpedo boat, making it the first and only time during WW2 when an Italian warship successfully used surface search radar to sink an enemy vessel. Scipio on official duty carried new Prime Minister Badoglio to the signing of the long armistice with the Allies, after which she spent the rest of the war assisting Allied warships.

After the end of World War II, the cruiser moved to La Spezia, where in 1948 she was removed from the fleet list and renamed ''S.7'' and after being moved to Toulon, she was transferred to France and renamed ''Guichen'' in honour of Admiral Luc Urbain du Buexic, Count of Guichen. In 1949, the cruiser took part in the return of the French gold reserve back to France. In 1957, Guichen became the flagship of the Atlantic Light Fleet. By 1963, she was disarmed and used as a training ship. She was decommissioned in June 1976, then sold for scrap in January 1982.

'''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]] in her 1957 refit. Despite her size, she is best played similarly to an anti-air destroyer. Lacking a sufficient number of high-calibre main guns, she may struggle in a 1v1 even against destroyers. Her role is primarily in second-line defence, assisting friendly vessels with her excellent anti-air and anti-coastal capability.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|SK C/33 AA (105 mm)}}

Guichen's main armament is not the 138.6 mm guns found on prior French destroyers, but instead the German 10.5 cm/60 SK C/33 cannon found as secondary armament on German heavy cruisers and battleships. These guns feature a very high rate of fire at 17 rounds per minute with an aced crew, or around 15 rounds per minute with a basic crew. When shooting at surface ships, high explosive is still effective against surface modules like gun turrets and rangefinders, but the low penetration means damaging modules deep within the ship like engines and boilers will be difficult. Against cruisers, the thickness of their hull (25 mm steel) means that the HE shells will do very little damage, and will also be stopped by any armour belt.

If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->

{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|L3 (550 mm)}}

Guichen has twelve L3 torpedoes in four triple launchers located near the bridge. There are two launchers on each side of the ship, with decent firing arcs. Despite being anti-submarine torpedoes, they have a decent warhead weight of 200 kg TNT. However, these torpedoes are both short-ranged and fairly slow, with a maximum speed of 46 km/h and a maximum range of 5 kilometres. This means that these torpedoes are best used in close-quarters combat around islands.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* All guns have a high rate of fire
* Search Radar
* Fire Directors have a 3 second update interval
* 57 mm guns do not overheat

'''Cons:'''

* Torpedoes only have a 5 km range, with no "Torpedo Mode" modification
* Lacks SAP or AP shells
* Only the main guns have Timed-Fuse shells, and the ship lacks a tracking radar
