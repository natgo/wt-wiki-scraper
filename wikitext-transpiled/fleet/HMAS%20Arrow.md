== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

The HMAS Arrow was part of a series of 20 patrol boats ordered by the Royal Australian Navy. HMAS ''Arrow'' was commissioned into naval service on 3 July 1968, to serve as light coast patrol, search and rescue and replacing older craft in service at the time.

While possibly being in the eye of the storm due to the evident lack of substantial firepower when compared to relatives at the rank as the armed to the teeth [[Fairmile D (697)]] or [[Fairmile D (601)]], Arrow should not be underestimated. The single 40 mm QF (Quick-Firing) Mark VII gun is a known effective gun. Not only for the superior fire rate but also due to efficient ballistics, range and penetration values. Experienced captains and newcomers alike may take advantage of this gun to make the Arrow shine.

With no surprise on the speed or additional armament, Arrow is straightforward in its playstyle, likely focusing on long-range gunnery to duel faster and smaller patrol boats that probably will be also better armed. In this regard, it is a good learning step to the similar playstyle of the later [[Brave Borderer]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Remarkable 40 mm gun range; capable of outranging smaller calibres at the rank (effective up to 5,000 m)
* An additional 12.7 mm HMG allows to protect the rear of the vehicle against light craft; an improvement when compared to the [[Dark (Family)|Dark-class]]
* Gun penetration can deal with armoured boats such as the Pr.1124 or MBK-161

'''Cons:'''

* Top speed is below average, when compared to nimbler boats at the rank
* Seriously under armed for its size and speed; smaller vessels overwhelm Arrow at close range
* No additional armament; nor torpedoes or depth charges
* Very low combat endurance against bigger vessels due to minimal crew size
