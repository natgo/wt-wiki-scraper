The '''HMAS Nepal (G25)''' is a member of the N-class destroyer family. Initially commissioned as HMAS Norseman in 1941, she was renamed HMAS Nepal during repairs in recognition of Nepal's role in the UK's war effort during World War II. She had sustained significant damage during an air raid on the shipyard owned by John I. Thornycroft and Company. Despite being put into service as the HMAS in 1942, the ship continued to be a part of the larger organization that was commanded by the UK. The HMAS Nepal served in the Indian Ocean for the majority of its wartime tenure as a vessel in the British Eastern Fleet. The HMAS Nepal was transferred to the British Pacific Fleet at the beginning of 1945 and served with them for the rest of the war. The HMAS Nepal was decommissioned upon her return to Sydney in October 1945, and upon her return to the UK, she was recommissioned as HMS Nepal. She was scrapped in 1956.

Introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]], the HMAS Nepal and the [[HMS Eskimo]] have nearly the same auxiliary batteries and main armament. The HMAS Nepal has more torpedoes, a more potent anti-aircraft battery, and a faster top speed than the HMS Eskimo, but she lacks the latter vessel's strong secondary battery and larger crew. This enables the HMAS Nepal to be a multipurpose vessel while retaining the HMS Eskimo's potent long-range engagement ability.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
With a straight stem bow, reduced length and single funnel, the Nepal is a smaller destroyer than her Tribal counterparts, and thus a smaller target. However, the main disadvantage this ship experiences is its less than desirable survivability particularly at close range.
The Nepal is a lightly-armoured destroyer; with armour plating of up to 12.7 mm on most gun emplacements, with anti-fragmentation armour of 3.2 mm on its main batteries. The Nepal has exposed ammo stowages on the bow and stern at multiple points, making it especially vunerable to fire and ammunition detonations, and the hull and superstructure has no armour above or below the waterline. Unlike previous Tribal-class destroyers which had a 3-boiler room layout, the N-class destroyers have two adjacent boiler rooms: this makes them vunerable to losing all power as a penetrating hit at any area near the boiler rooms is likely to destroy both boilers, and these are not protected by armour or fuel tanks.

A crew of 208 sailors means that this destroyer has a much lower crew complement than many of its contemporaries and is less survivable. As such, this ship is best used at range from opponents.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Nepal has two Admiralty three-drum boilers feeding two steam turbines, and can reach up to 46 knots at flank, and has good turning. Furthermore, the stern armament can be brought to bear against a forward target at a relatively low degree of turn: as such, it is not always necessary to present the full hull of the ship to deliver a broadside which allows it to present a smaller target to opponents.

The N-class is similar to the other rank II destroyer [[HMS Eskimo]], sharing an identical main armament and near-identical auxiliary batteries. While the N-class lacks the Tribal's powerful secondary battery and larger crew size, it makes up for it with a better top speed, more torpedoes, and a more effective AA battery. This makes the N-class something of a jack-of-all-trades, while also still giving it the powerful long-range firepower found on the Tribal.

The N-class' guns are the star of the show. While the 4.7-inch cannons lack the deadly rate of fire of the American 5-inch guns, they still pack a hefty punch. They are also some of the most accurate destroyer guns in the game, only beaten in accuracy by the 100 mm guns of the Akizuki. Having four of the guns pointing forwards also allows the N-class to concentrate a constant, heavy barrage of fire directly forwards, allowing it to leave a smaller profile for enemy guns to hit. Make use of the N-class effectiveness at long-ranges and attack other destroyers from afar.

When opponents do get closer, the N-class is still a nasty ship to fight. While the main turrets have a slow traverse, the guns at close ranges are scarily accurate and will hit hard when they do impact. In addition, the N-class has 5 torpedoes, which have an average speed but do immense damage on impact. One torpedo hit can be enough to sink some destroyers, and will do heavy damage to the light cruisers the N-class can fight in an uptier. Aircraft will also struggle immensely against the N-class, thanks to its powerful AA battery. The 20 mm guns can cause a spray of fire for fighter-bombers to avoid, while the quad-barreled 40 mm cannon will make short work of larger aircraft that stray too close. The N-class is also a very fast destroyer once fully upgraded, allowing it to get in and out of position with ease, as well as dictate the flow of the battle effectively.

The main opponents to the N-class are destroyers with fast-firing guns (like the American destroyers and the Germans with the 12.7 cm guns), who can out-gun the N-class effectively at close range. In addition, destroyers with fast torpedoes can make short work of the N-class, which lacks effective counter-torpedo capabilities and is a very easy ship to sink, thanks in part to its vulnerable ammo stowage. Lastly, the N-class should avoid cruisers at all costs. Cruisers can out-gun the N-class at any range, and some can even out-torpedo it as well.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Accurate and powerful guns gives the N-class effective and deadly long-range salvoes
* Good top speed and mobility allows for fast responses to situations across the map
* Effective AA armament can make short work of attack aircraft
* Torpedoes have good distance and a hefty explosive mass, allowing for huge damage on impact

'''Cons:'''

* Poor turret traverse can cause issues in close quarter combat
* Torpedoes are slow compared to contemporaries, especially with the torpedo mode upgrade
* Weak auxiliary armament for defending against torpedo boats, especially when also being attacked by aircraft

[[File:HMAS Nepal AWM-301077.jpg|thumb|HMAS Nepal (ex-Norseman), date unknown.]]
HMAS Nepal was a N-class destroyer built for the Royal Australian Navy. Initially launched as HMS Norseman, the ship was severely damaged by air raids during construction and renamed HMAS Nepal, destined to serve with the Australian Navy. HMAS Nepal served extensively during the Second World War, primarily in the Indian and Pacific theatres of war. Following the cessation of hostilities, she was returned to the British, who eventually scrapped her by 1956.

=== Design and construction ===
The N-class of destroyers were the final class in the trio of classes known as the J-, K-, and N-classes. They were the heaviest-armed out of the three classes and carried a substantial main armament. As with the previous J- and K-classes, the N-class had a reduced torpedo armament in favour of carrying additional anti-aircraft guns. The HMAS Nepal was initially ordered and built as HMS Norseman, but in December of 1941, an air raid caused serious damage to the unfinished ship. As a result, the decision was made to complete her as HMAS Nepal, in honour of the Nepalese contribution to the war effort.

HMAS Nepal displaced 1,760 tons standard and had a crew of 226 officers and men. The ship's main armament consisted of six 4.7 inch (119 mm) QF Mk XII dual-purpose main guns in three dual turrets, two fore and one aft. The ship's anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single 4 inch QF Mk V gun, a four-barreled 40 mm Pom Pom gun, and numerous smaller anti-aircraft guns. Powered by steam turbines producing 40,000 shaft horsepower, the ship was able to reach a max speed of 36 knots (67 km/h).

=== Operational history ===
After her commissioning as HMAS Nepal, the ship was loaned to the Australian navy, while the United Kingdom retained ownership of the ship itself. She was immediately assigned to the Home Fleet, and was used in the filming of the war film In Which We Serve. In July of 1942, the ship was transferred to the British Eastern Fleet, which it would serve with for most of the duration of the Second World War. The ship participated in the later parts of the Madagascar campaign, and participated in convoy escort / patrol duties in the Eastern theatre. In March of 1943, she sailed to Australia for a refit.

Following the completion of the refit, Nepal returned to the Eastern theatre and provided cover during Operation Cockpit and Operation Transom. During this time, she frequently escorted aircraft carriers, and also provided fire support to units on land. In March of 1945, she was transferred to the British Pacific Fleet, and remained there until the end of the war without seeing much action. She was thereafter returned to the British, who reduced her into reserve. She was subsequently used as a training and trials ship, before being scrapped by 1956. HMAS Nepal earned four battle stars for her WWII service.

HMAS Nepal was laid down in Great Britain in September of 1939, initially under the name of "Norseman". As one of the last ships of the N-class destroyer type, she was launched in December 1941, but was soon severely damaged while still in the shipyard during a German air raid.

Despite the severe damage, the ship was repaired and renamed to Nepal, in recognition of Nepal's contribution to the British war effort. After the repairs were completed, the ship was formally commissioned into service with the Royal Australian Navy in May 1942, although still remaining the property of the Royal Navy.

In July 1942, HMAS Nepal was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet and shortly afterwards set out for Kenya. In September, HMAS Nepal was involved in the Madagascar campaign. Before heading to Australia for refits in spring 1943, the ship served as a convoy escort and performed anti-submarine patrols.

After her two-month long refit, HMAS Nepal resumed operations in June 1943, taking part in some major operations in 1944 as a carrier escort. The ship underwent another refit in August 1944, before embarking on some of her final operations.

HMAS Nepal remained active in the Pacific theatre until the end of WW2, until being decommissioned from RNA service in October 1945. The ship was commissioned once more into the Royal Navy shortly after, being ordered to return to Britain.

In the postwar years, HMAS Nepal underwent repairs and modifications, briefly serving as a minesweeper and training ship. In the early 1950s, HMAS Nepal was part of the reserve and awaiting some proposed upgrades. However, those upgrades were eventually cancelled and the decision was made to scrap the ship. January 1956 marked the end of HMAS Nepal's 14-year service life as she was sold off for scraps to the British Iron & Steel Corporation.
