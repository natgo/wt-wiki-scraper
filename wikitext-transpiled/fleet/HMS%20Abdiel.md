== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

The Abdiel-class "mine-laying cruisers" were a class of six fast minelayers. Designed for quick minelaying operations close to enemy waters or shipping lanes, the ships of the class feature exceptionally high top speed that even rivals destroyers and sufficient armaments to fend off the enemy if detected.

Because of these unusual characteristics, the Abdiel-class often found themselves in roles that they were not intended for, especially as a troop transport. The {{PAGENAME}}, the lead ship of the class, also found itself in these risky missions. After minelaying and landing operations around the Mediterranean between 1941-43, Abdiel was sunk on 10 September 1943 during the Operation Slapstick landings off the coast of Taranto, Italy, struck by German submarine-laid mines.

{{Notice|HMS Abdiel is classed as a light cruiser and has a low BR compared to other light cruisers. In this BR bracket, there are some maps that don't feature a cruiser spawn (namely Aleutian Islands) and there is a risk that you won't be able to spawn anything if your line-up consists only of HMS Abdiel herself.}}

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Features fast-firing and accurate 4-inch guns
* High top speed and mobility
* Decent anti-air defense
* Can be loaded with 40 sea mines for area denial

'''Cons:'''

* Being classed as a light cruiser, the ship is forced to spawn at longer ranges where the 4-inch guns are less effective
* Lacks any torpedo armament 
* Practically no armour protection save for the bridge; highly vulnerable to enemy fire
* Extremely vulnerable magazines and mine racks, both sit way above the waterline
