== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''HMS Cadiz (D79)''' is a member of the Tribal-class destroyer family. The HMS Cadiz was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. She was commissioned on April 12, 1946, after being launched on September 16, 1944. She was named after the Battle of Cadiz, a French siege of the Spanish town in 1810 that was eventually lifted in 1812 following the French defeat at the Battle of Salamanca. In 1956, she was transferred to the Pakistan Navy and commissioned as PNS Khaibar. During the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, she was sunk off the coast of Karachi by the Indian Navy missile boat INS Nirghat.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VII, "Armoured Elephant"]], the HMS Cadiz is a fast destroyer equipped with powerful main armaments mounted in the bow. She, like the HMAS Tobruk, possesses superior secondary armament and a high sustained rate of fire. As a result, aircraft and fast-attack vessels may view the HMS Cadiz as a potentially dangerous target. Keep the HMS Cadiz close to the coast, given that she is a lethal opponent for fast coastal craft. Use her to protect allied coastal vessels as they capture objectives to win the battle.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The destroyer HMS Cadiz (D79) was laid down at the Scottish shipyard of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in 1944, but was commissioned after the end of the war, in April 1946. The ship was assigned to the Home Fleet and participated in diplomatic cruises, exercises, and also in the Coronation Review (1953) to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1956, the destroyer was sold to the Pakistan Navy. Before being sent to a new home port, the ship was modernised and refitted, and received a new name - PNS Khaibar. In 1971, during the Indo-Pakistani War, the destroyer Khaibar was sunk as a result of two hits by Soviet-made P-15 Termit anti-ship missiles launched by the Indian missile boat Nirghat. This was the first effective use of missiles of this class by the Indian navy.
