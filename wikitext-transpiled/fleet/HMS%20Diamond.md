== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} British destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]]. 

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
In terms of survivability, HMS Diamond demonstrates commendable resilience, despite lacking anti-fragmentation armor around its hull. Its sleek design, coupled with ammunition storage largely shielded by being below the waterline, significantly enhance its survivability in combat scenarios. However, with a relatively modest crew complement of 330 personnel, the ship remains vulnerable to sustained fire from rapid-firing cannons, particularly those equipped with the potent Mk.22 cannon mount commonly found on American destroyers. Moreover, the threat posed by Soviet 130mm rounds cannot be underestimated, given their powerful explosive filler and potential to inflict significant damage. Fortunately, mitigating factors exist to improve the ship's survivability. Removal of torpedoes, for instance, can drastically reduce the ship's vulnerability to fire. While the torpedoes onboard offer an advantage, their overall performance may not warrant the associated risk, especially considering their relatively modest capabilities compared to other torpedo systems.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
HMS Diamond may have modest mobility, but it stands out as one of the fastest ships within its battle rating, particularly when encountering lower-tier adversaries. Its top speed of 64 km/h allows for swift navigation across maps, offering an advantage in naval engagements. Despite its classification as a destroyer, its relatively compact size grants it agility akin to that of a corvette, affording it a surprisingly tight turn radius.

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|4.5 inch/45 QF Mark V (114 mm)}}
The 4.5 inch/45 QF Mark V cannons aboard HMS Diamond prove to be formidable armaments, particularly effective against light to medium armored ships and aerial targets. Despite their relatively modest explosive yield compared to other munitions of similar caliber, they deliver a considerable punch, ensuring devastating impacts upon target engagement. With an upgraded crew, HMS Diamond achieves an impressive firing rate of up to 20 rounds per minute, mirroring the capabilities of the USS Moffet. A notable feature of these cannons is their consistent firing rate, as there is no need to pause for reloading due to the absence of a ready rack. However, disruptions such as fires or flooding onboard may temporarily hinder this rapid rate of fire. To optimize ammunition usage and effectiveness, it is recommended to utilize HE-VT projectiles whenever possible. These projectiles offer the same explosive filler as standard HE rounds but with the added advantage of a proximity fuze, maximizing the ship's combat efficiency while conserving valuable ammunition space. In situations requiring engagement of armored targets or encounters at challenging angles, such as front aspect shots, SAP projectiles are advised.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|QF Mark V (40 mm)|QF STAAG Mark II (40 mm)}}
The 40mm autocannons serve as versatile weapons with potent capabilities for both air defense and point-blank defense. In air defense roles, these autocannons excel at engaging low-flying aircraft and as a deterrence for high-flying aircraft. Their high rate of fire and effective range make them formidable tools for intercepting fast-moving targets with precision accuracy. Additionally, their ammunition options include a set of munitions ready for all scenarios, universal clip is advised. In point-blank defense scenarios, 40mm autocannons provide reliable firepower for engaging close-range threats such as small boats. Their rapid rate of fire and substantial caliber make them effective deterrents against targets at short distances.
