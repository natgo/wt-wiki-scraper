'''HMS Diamond''' was a Royal Navy [[Daring (Family)|Daring-class destroyer]] commissioned in February 1952. She participated in the significant 1953 Fleet Review and the Suez Crisis of 1956. She was also involved in two notable collisions: first with HMS Swiftsure during a 1953 naval exercise, and later with HMS Salisbury in 1964. She went through one major refit, in 1959. The last episode of her service was as an engineering training ship from 1970 at Gosport until 1981, when she was scrapped in Rainham, Kent.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium destroyer introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]] as the third vessel of her class added to the game. Thanks to her large hull size, she can survive a significant number of hits, especially from HE ammunition, but she's very prone to ammo-rack explosions, as her aft and auxiliary ammunition racks are above the waterline. She features excellent main guns with a wide choice of ammunition, very good torpedoes, and competent anti-air guns to discourage enemy bombers or torpedo boats. Finally, she has a radar with a lead indicator, making it easier to hit distant aerial targets with {{Annotation|HE-VT|High-explosive variable time fuse}} rounds.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
In terms of survivability, HMS Diamond demonstrates commendable resilience, despite lacking anti-fragmentation armour around its hull. Its sleek design, coupled with its primary ammunition storage being largely shielded below the waterline (particularly the forward 4.5 inch magazines), significantly enhance its survivability in combat scenarios. However, with a relatively modest crew complement of 330 personnel, the ship remains vulnerable to sustained fire from rapid-firing cannons, particularly those equipped with the potent Mk.22 cannon mount commonly found on American destroyers. Moreover, the threat posed by Soviet 130 mm rounds cannot be underestimated, given their powerful explosive filler and potential to inflict significant damage. Fortunately, mitigating factors exist to improve the ship's survivability: Removing the torpedoes, for instance, can drastically reduce the ship's vulnerability to fire. While the torpedoes offer a distinct advantage, their overall performance may not warrant the associated risk, despite their respectable capabilities compared to other torpedo systems.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
HMS Diamond may have modest mobility, but it stands out as one of the fastest ships within its battle rating, particularly when encountering lower-tier adversaries. Its top speed of 64 km/h allows for swift navigation across maps, offering an advantage in naval engagements. Despite its classification as a destroyer, its relatively compact size grants it agility akin to that of a corvette, affording it a surprisingly tight turn radius.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|4.5 inch/45 QF Mark V (114 mm)}}

The 4.5 inch/45 QF Mark V cannons aboard HMS Diamond prove to be formidable armaments, particularly effective against light to medium armoured ships and aerial targets. Despite their relatively modest explosive yield compared to other munitions of similar calibre, they deliver a considerable punch, ensuring devastating impacts upon target engagement. With an upgraded crew, HMS Diamond achieves an impressive firing rate of up to 20 rounds per minute, mirroring the capabilities of the [[USS Moffett]]. A notable feature of these cannons is their consistent firing rate, as there is no need to pause for reloading due to the absence of a ready rack. However, disruptions such as fires or flooding onboard may temporarily hinder this rapid rate of fire. To optimize ammunition usage and effectiveness, it is recommended to utilize HE-VT projectiles whenever possible. These projectiles offer the same explosive filler as standard HE rounds but with the added advantage of a proximity fuze, maximizing the ship's combat efficiency while conserving valuable ammunition space. In situations requiring engagement of armoured targets or encounters at challenging angles, such as front aspect shots, SAP projectiles are advised.

If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|QF Mark V (40 mm)|QF STAAG Mark II (40 mm)}}

The 40 mm autocannons serve as versatile weapons with potent capabilities for both air defense and point-blank defense. In air defense roles, these autocannons excel at engaging low-flying aircraft and as a deterrence for high-flying aircraft. Their high rate of fire and effective range make them formidable tools for intercepting fast-moving targets with precision accuracy. Additionally, their ammunition options include a set of munitions ready for all scenarios, universal clip is advised. In point-blank defense scenarios, 40 mm autocannons provide reliable firepower for engaging close-range threats such as small boats. Their rapid rate of fire and substantial calibre make them effective deterrents against targets at short distances.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.IX** (533 mm)}}
As with the HMS Daring in the standard tech tree, the name ship of her class, HMS Diamond is equipped with ten 533 mm Mk.IX** torpedoes, launched from two quintuple launchers located amidships. Notably, this is twice as many as the HMS Diana, the other Daring-class destroyer in the standard tech tree. With 587.2 kg of TNT explosive equivalent and a decent speed of 76 km/h, the powerful Mk.IX** torpedo is useful against any target, especially at close range. However, the torpedo launchers' poor firing arcs restrict their usefulness, as Diamond's captains will be forced to show her vulnerable broadsides to launch them.

'''Pros:'''

* Six fast-firing and powerful 4.5 inch guns with no first-stage ammo racks
* Turrets have good traverse speed and coverage
* Survivable against destroyers due to high crew count
* Good anti-air coverage and armament

'''Cons:'''

* Critical modules are largely unarmoured, vulnerable to armour-piercing shells
* Rear magazine is slightly above the waterline, and the auxiliary shell room in the bow is far above it, making them fatal weak spots
* Relatively sluggish for a destroyer due to high displacement
* Torpedo launchers have somewhat-restrictive firing arcs

HMS Diamond was a Royal Navy [[Daring (Family)|Daring-class destroyer]], laid down on 15 March 1949 at the J. Brown & Co. shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, launched on 14 June 1950, and commissioned on 21 February 1952. Her motto was Honor clarissima gemma, meaning "Honour is the brightest jewel."

HMS Diamond participated in several significant operations during her active service. In 1953, she took part in the Fleet Review marking the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Later that same year, on 29 September, she was involved in a collision with the cruiser HMS Swiftsure during Exercise Mariner near the coast of Iceland. The incident was attributed to challenging weather conditions and the lack of communication or navigation lights enforced by the exercise. As a result, Diamond sustained damage to her bow but returned safely to the shipyard for repairs. Following this, she was deployed during the Suez Crisis in 1956.

After a refit at Chatham Dockyard in 1959, HMS Diamond resumed operations but was involved in a second collision, this time with HMS Salisbury on 25 June 1964 in the English Channel during a naval demonstration. High-speed manoeuvres of multiple vessels in close proximity were found to be at fault. Following repairs, she returned to active service for several more years.

In 1970, HMS Diamond was repurposed as a Harbour Training Ship, moored at Priddy's Hard in Gosport, where she was used for training by the Marine Engineering School. Her steam plant remained functional for watchkeeping training until she was replaced by HMS Londonderry. After serving in this capacity for several years, HMS Diamond was eventually scrapped in November 1981 in Rainham, Kent.
