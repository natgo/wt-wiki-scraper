== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

Designed in the immediate aftermath of World War II, the Daring-class destroyers incorporated lessons learned during the war and reflect change of doctrine of the post-war Royal Navy. The class features an emphasis on operation range and armaments, intended to supplement and eventually supersede cruisers which were deemed too expensive to operate.

Because of her unusually large size for a destroyer at that time, the class were initially called "Darings" in a similar manner to various battleship built after the [[HMS Dreadnought]]. Though they were not as revolutionary as its Great War counterparts, they represented the final evolution of the British "gun destroyer" before the advent of guided missile destroyers in the 60s.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
When compared to her real life predecessor, the [[Battle (Family)|Battle-class destroyer]], {{PAGENAME}} features similar characteristics along with some noticeable changes. She retains two forward-facing 4.5 inch turret of the Battle-class, but receives also an additional turret at the stern. Being designed for operation range and survivability, she is also considerably more resilient to enemy fire thanks to the compact crew compartment.

However, the Diana still shares the common weakness with other British WWII destroyers in terms of armour (or lack thereof). Her hull is almost devoid of any armour save for a thin layer of anti-fragmentation armour around the bridge and turrets. In addition, her anti-air and rear turret's shell room were located way above the waterline, both of them were fatal weak spot that will be exposed when doing broadsides and can be somewhat counterintuitive to the ship's additional firepower improvement.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Being optimized for operation range, the Diana's top speed is below average for a destroyer. In addition, the ship's displacement will also affect her mobility, making her a bit less manoeuvrable.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|4.5 inch/45 QF Mark V (114 mm)}}

The Diana features six 4.5 inch QF Mark V guns as her main armament, mounted in three twin turrets arranged in A-Bs-X position. These were the same weapon system as [[HMAS Tobruk]] and thus shared the same automatic ramming system and shell choice from its Australian counterpart, providing great and consistent rate of fire at 20 rpm with no first-stage ammo rack.

The gun has four shell choices: a HE shell with 2.32 kg of TNT equivalent, enough to cause damage to any unarmoured ship, a HE-TF and a HE-VT shell for anti-air purposes with the same filler as regular HE shell, and a SAP shell with largely the same performance as the one from British 5-inch guns.

As mentioned in the "Survivability and armour" section. While it is tempting to do broadsides to exploit the Diana's additional firepower at the rear, in doing so will expose her unprotected magazines at her bow and stern to the enemy. Thus, while in firefight, it is recommended to face her bow to the enemy at all times only use her frontal armament to minimize the risk of detonation.

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|QF Mark V (40 mm)|QF STAAG Mark II (40 mm)}}

For dedicated anti-air defence, the Diana features six 40 mm Bofors autocannon in two STAAG dual mounts flanking the bridge and one Mk V mount located behind her second funnel.

Compared to the Battle-class destroyers, the Diana's AA defense is somewhat of a downgrade due to the lower gun count and less coverage. Nevertheless, they still provide great defense against enemy aircraft, especially when used in tandem with the 4.5 inch guns.

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.IX** (533 mm)}}

As with other late British destroyers, the Diana is equipped with five 533 mm Mk.IX** torpedoes, launched from a single quintuple launcher located on the midship section. With 587.2 kg of TNT explosive equivalent and decent speed of 76 km/h, these powerful torpedoes are useful against any targets, especially at close range. However, the low quantity of torpedoes on board along with the launcher's poor firing arc significantly restrict its usefulness, as her captains will be forced to show the vulnerable broadsides to launch them.

== Usage in battles ==

'''Pros:'''

* Six fast-firing and powerful 4.5 inch guns with no first-stage ammo racks
* Turret has good traverse speed and coverage
* Survivable against destroyers due to high crew count
* Good anti-air coverage

'''Cons:'''

* Critical modules were largely unarmoured, vulnerable to armour-piercing shells
* Auxiliary shell room at the bow and rear magazine is above the waterline, making it a fatal weak spot
* Relatively sluggish for a destroyer due to high displacement
* Carries only five torpedoes with restrictive firing arc

HMS Diana was laid down at Clydebank, Glasgow on 3rd April 1947, launched on 8th May 1952, and was commissioned on 29th March 1954. Originally planned to be named Druid, this was changed to Diana during construction. HMS Diana was considered a large destroyer, with the design coming from lessons of the Pacific War where long endurance was very important.

With a main armament of six 4.5 inch (114 mm) dual-purpose guns in 3 fully enclosed twin turrets and being fully radar-controlled, the fire control system was considered the most advanced in the Royal Navy at the time. The guns were regarded as highly accurate with a high rate of fire. Completing the armament were 2 x 40 mm Bofors, 5 torpedo tubes and a triple "Squid" anti-submarine mortar.

Seeing combat in the Suez Crisis, HMS Diana was involved with the sinking of Egyptian frigate Domiat, which was engaged in a gun duel with the cruiser HMS Newfoundland. This engagement marked the last time in conflict a ship was sunk by another by gunfire only.

In 1968, Diana was diverted from her route to assist in the search for the British-made, Israeli-ordered submarine Dakar. During this search, Diana diverted again to assist Spanish tanker MV Bahia Blanca which was on fire.

In 1969, HMS Diana was sold to the Peruvian navy, renamed BAP Palacios, and refitted at Cammell Laird with new radar and 8 Exocet missiles.
