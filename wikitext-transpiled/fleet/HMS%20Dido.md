The '''HMS Dido (37)''' is a member of the Dido-class light cruiser family. Constructed in 1940 for World War II, she saw service throughout the war. The keel of the HMS Dido was laid down on October 26, 1937, by the Birkenhead-based Cammell Laird Shipyard. She was launched on July 18, 1939, and commissioned on September 30, 1940, in Birkenhead. In September 1940, the HMS Dido was sent to Scapa Flow for overhaul after being commissioned. High-speed sweeps off Fair Isle and Greenland were part of this. Following this, the HMS Dido's first mission, in November 1940, was to ferry aircraft from the aircraft carrier Furious to West Africa. She escorted convoys in the Atlantic at the start of World War II before moving to the Mediterranean. The HMS Dido took part in the second battle of the Gulf of Sirte in 1942, the landings in Sicily in 1943, and the French south coast in 1944. She escorted Arctic convoys and supported strikes off the coast of Norway in 1945. After the war, the HMS Dido was used for ceremonial purposes. In July 1945, Queen Elizabeth and King George VI were brought to the Isle of Man by the HMS Dido. From 1946 until 1948, she was commanded by P. Reid. She took part in the Fleet Review in 1953 to honour the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II as flagship of the Reserve Fleet. Subsequently, in 1957, she was withdrawn from service and acquired by Thos. W. Ward for decommissioning. She was scrapped at Barrow-in-Furness.

Introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]], the HMS Dido is best used to shield allies from enemy aircraft and hunt enemy destroyers. She is very well protected against destroyers' standard armaments, and in exchange, her main armament can deal a significant amount of damage to them with just one salvo. At medium to long range, however, the HMS Dido will find it difficult to compete with even light cruisers. In addition, most light cruisers can penetrate the weak armour rather easily, so it is not advisable to engage enemy larger vessels unless players have multiple allies to support them.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The ''Dido''<nowiki/>'s hull features 76 mm of rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) plating over the sides of the machinery spaces with 25 mm of RHA covering the ends and the machinery deck. This plating covers the boilers and the parts of propeller shafts that are above the waterline. The steering gear is protected by 25.4 mm RHA plating all around. The main gun turrets and barbettes are also protected by 25.4 mm RHA, as is helm located in the central shaft leading down from the bridge.

The ammunition magazines are very well-protected against other light cruisers' and destroyers' main guns. They are located below the waterline and there is 50.8 mm RHA deck plating over the main gun magazines, as well as covering the bow and stern-facing ends of the magazines. The sides of the magazines are protected by 19.05 mm of anti-fragmentation armour. In addition, there are fuel tanks on each side of the magazines. This means that only plunging fire from high calibre guns can be expected to reach the magazines.

The rest of the hull is entirely unprotected by anything other than the standard 25 mm steel plating of light cruisers. The bridge, in particular, is open and quite vulnerable to getting disabled by even destroyers.

There is also 12.7 mm hardened armour plating facing the front of the 20 mm Oerlikon mounts.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The ''Dido''<nowiki/>'s mobility is rather standard for a light cruiser. She is not quite as fast or as nimble as the ''Enterprise'', but her mobility is adequate for most needs.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|5.25 inch/50 QF Mark I (133 mm)}}

The ''Dido''<nowiki/>'s primary armament consists of ten QF 5.25-inch dual-purpose guns. These are most comparable to the 5"/38 guns carried by most American destroyers and the [[USS Atlanta|USS ''Atlanta'']]. The 5.25-inch gun's rate-of-fire is much lower (10 rounds/minute vs. 22 rounds/minute), firing generally heavier shells.

All of the main gun turrets are capable of full 360° traverse and elevating up to 70°, allowing them to engage aircraft effectively. They also have a relatively fast traverse rate compared to other light cruisers, although a bit on the slow side for engaging aircraft.

The ammunition types available consist of HE, SAP, and HE-VT. HE-VT is broadly superior to standard HE, especially against aircraft. Despite the heavier shells, both contain less explosive filler than the HE shells of the American 5"/38. The SAP is superior to the Common shells of the American 5"/38, having better penetration and more explosive filler. It is capable of penetrating light cruisers, and even heavy cruisers at close range.

{{main|2pdr QF Mk.VIII (40 mm)}}

The ''Dido''<nowiki/>'s designated secondary armament is the two quadruple 2-pdr 'pom-pom' guns mounted amidships. These are primarily anti-aircraft guns, although they can be effective against lighter targets such as destroyers and coastal craft at close ranges.

{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

The ''Dido''<nowiki/>'s designated anti-aircraft armament consists of five single 20 mm Oerlikon mounts. These are lethal against coastal craft and aircraft that dare to approach within range.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.IX (533 mm)}}

The ''Dido'' is armed with two triple 21-inch torpedo tubes located next to the aft funnel, one on each side of the ship. Unlike on British destroyers, these torpedo tubes have wide traverse arcs. They are armed with the Mk. IX torpedo, which has a powerful 340 kg TNT warhead and long range (9.67 km) even without the torpedo modification.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The ''Dido''<nowiki/>'s unusual main gun battery makes her very specialised as an anti-aircraft and anti-destroyer ship. She is very well protected against destroyer guns, and in return, a single salvo from her ten 5.25-inch guns will inflict a great deal of damage to them.

Conversely, the ''Dido'' will struggle against even light cruisers at medium to long ranges, having to rely on whittling down the crews using fires and HE. At close range, her SAP is effective against light cruisers, and the high rate-of-fire compared to cruiser 6-inch guns can be used to disable and then overwhelm them. However, the ''Dido''<nowiki/>'s armour can be penetrated relatively easily by the 6-inch guns of most light cruisers, so engaging in straight-up trading fights will usually result in taking extensive damage, even if the ''Dido'' emerges victorious. The ''Dido'' is mostly helpless against heavy cruisers and battleships other than getting close enough to torpedo them.

Once the HE-VT shells have been unlocked, the 5.25-inch gun is quite effective against aircraft, though the relatively low rate-of-fire makes it less than ideal in the role compared to other true dual-purpose guns such as the British 4.5-inch or the American 5"/38 guns. The 'pom-poms' and 20 mm Oerlikons mostly function as  back-up to the main guns. They should not be relied upon to shoot down aircraft except at close ranges.

Because of her weight distribution and narrow hull, Dido rolls rather dramatically in turns, leaning towards the outer side of the turning circle. It might prove detrimental in close range combat, as guns can't depress enough to fire at anything inside ~4 km range on the raised side (assuming full speed ahead, max rudder deflection).

[[File:HMS Dido (37).jpg|thumb|450x450px|HMS Dido at anchor in the Firth of Forth.]]
HMS ''Dido'' (37) was a British AA cruiser and the lead ship of her class, a series of 16 ships built in the late 1930s to the early 1940s. Designed for fleet air defence, the ships were armed with a 5.25-inch (133 mm) main battery capable of engaging both ships and naval vessels. ''Dido'' was commissioned in 1940 and deployed to the Mediterranean, serving there for the large part of the Second World War. She later deployed to the Arctic, and in 1945 accepted the surrender of the Kriegsmarine. ''Dido'' was present at the Coronation review of 1953 as the flagship of the Reserve fleet, and was scrapped in 1957.

=== Design and development ===
Following the four ships of the ''Arethusa'' class, the British navy decided to construct a new class of light cruiser for anti-aircraft duties - the ''Dido'' class. Displacing 6850 tons on full load, the ships were small even for a light cruiser. Their armour was also scarce, the main belt being just 3 inches (76 mm) thick. The ''Dido''<nowiki/>'s main armament comprised 10 5.25-inch (133 mm) guns in five dual-purpose turrets, which served as the primary anti-ship and anti-aircraft armament. Her anti-aircraft armament was initially weak (quite surprising given her role), composed of three quad pom-poms and five single Oerlikon cannons; this was improved over the course of the Second World War. ''Dido'' was initially laid down in 1937, and was commissioned by 1940.

=== Operational history ===
Immediately after her commissioning, the ''Dido'' was sent to Scapa Flow, and spent the next couple months in training. However, she was soon dispatched to the British fleet in the Mediterranean, and soon began operating as part of the British East Mediterranean fleet. She ran supplies to Malta, and later helped move 7 million dollars of Gold away from the conflict-torn lands of Greece. She participated in several runs to the besieged island of Crete and was later damaged by bombs while escorting a troop convoy to Alexandria. She was later bombed again, but quickly repaired as she made up a significant portion of the ship-starved British East Mediterranean fleet.

''Dido'' spent the greater part of 1942 and 1943 in the Mediterranean, though she travelled back to the UK on several occasions for various reasons. In 1944, she was recalled to the UK and began convoy operations in the Arctic, and thereafter stayed in the northern Atlantic to lay mines and provide fire support. In May of 1945, she fired the last naval shot in Europe as she accepted the surrender of the Kriegsmarine; she then escorted the cruisers ''Prinz Eugen'' and ''Nurnberg'' to internment at Wilhelmshaven. Following the cessation of hostilities, ''Dido'' was reduced to reserve; she took part in the 1953 Coronation review of Queen Elizabeth II as the flagship of the reserve fleet. She was eventually sold for scrap in 1957.

The Dido-class light cruiser was designed in the 1930s as convoy escorts and destroyer leaders, intended for operations in the Mediterranean. As such, ships of the Dido-class had to be both large enough to operate in rough waters as well as fast and manoeuvrable enough in order to keep up with destroyers, whilst at the same time remaining relatively cheap to produce in large numbers.

HMS Dido, the lead ship of her class, was laid down in October 1937. In July 1939, Dido was completed and commissioned into service a year later. HMS Dido's early service life was marked with convoy escort duties in the Atlantic, before joining the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet in April 1941.

As part of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean forces, HMS Dido took part in numerous major operations, including the landings at Sicily and mainland Italy as well as southern France. During her service in the Mediterranean, HMS Dido performed various roles, from doing supply runs over evacuating troops to bombarding shorelines.

By 1944, HMS Dido briefly returned to Great Britain, before being sent off on escort duties as part of the Arctic convoys. In 1945, HMS Dido was sent to Copenhagen, where the warship fired the last naval shot as part of the war in Europe, however not in anger, but in celebration of the surrender of the German Kriegsmarine.

Sometime after the end of WW2, HMS Dido joined the ranks of the Royal Navy reserve fleet, remaining in service for another good decade. In 1957 however, HMS Dido was decommissioned from service and sold for scrap.
