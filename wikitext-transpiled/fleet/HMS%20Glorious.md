== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British battlecruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

One of the trio of the Courageous-class "large light cruiser", the {{PAGENAME}}'s design perfectly encapsulates Fleet Admiral Jackie Fisher's obsession with speed and firepower. Designed to get around the restriction to build new capital ship by the government, the Glorious' appearance is akin to that of a half-finished battleship with protection nowhere close to an actual battleship. Fortunately for the Glorious and her sister ship, the ship would later be converted into an aircraft carrier to put the better use for the wasted deck space after the Great War.

In War Thunder, the Glorious' unconventional design made her distinctive from the other "pocket battleship" at her BR, such as [[Admiral Graf Spee|Graf Spee]] and the [[IJN Ikoma|Ikoma]]. The ship is a true "glass cannon", featuring high offensive firepower in the form of four 381 mm cannons, numerous 102 mm guns, a truckload of torpedoes, along with good mobility to boot. But it still lacks an adequate armour to shield her off from enemy fire.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Four 381 mm guns, enough to cripple any enemy it might have to face
* Numerous fast-firing 102 mm provides steady damage output at mid-to-close range
* Huge empty space at the bow and stern can absorb several hits from shells and torpedoes
* Quite fast and manoeuvrable, despite the size
* Equipped with 40 torpedoes with decent performance

'''Cons:'''

* Very large and distinctive hull shape, easily identified and hit by any enemies
* Poor armour protection, relies heavily on fuel tanks to absorb damage
* Terrible main turret traverse speed, inability to fire reactively
* Poor anti-air defence
* Fixed torpedo tubes restrict its usage to saturational barrages

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Courageous-class battlecruisers were formulated during WW1 by the ever-eccentric First Sea Lord, Jacky Fisher, as part of his 'Baltic Project', a planned attack on the German Baltic coastline. In 1915, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had forbidden new construction of any warships larger than light cruisers, yet Lord Fisher wanted new fast capital ships for the Baltic Project in order to support his proposed landings of troops on the beaches of Pomerania.

In order to get around the rule against new capital ships and also because of Lord Fisher's obsession with speed at the expense of all else, the Courageous class were presented as 'large light cruisers', with extremely light armour, extremely high speed and half the main armament of the new Queen Elizabeth-class battleships. Fortunately for Fisher, many of the politicians up top had little knowledge in naval matters and so they saw the high speed, low armour and just approved the design for construction.

Unfortunately, however, the ships proved to be a little too lightly built and had a tendency to take structural damage in rough seas or at high speed or even when firing the main guns until they were structurally stiffened in response.

As Fisher's Baltic Project never took place, the ships spent the war patrolling the North Sea. HMS Glorious saw little action, other than the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, during which she only suffered damage from a premature shell detonation and her own muzzle blasts. She was also present for the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet in 1918.

The Courageous-class battlecruisers were converted into aircraft carriers in the 1920s.

On the return journey of an evacuation of British aircraft from Norway in June 1940, HMS Glorious was attacked by the German battleships [[Scharnhorst]] and Gneisenau, losing over 1,200 lives in the battle. HMS Glorious remains on the floor of the Fjord today.
