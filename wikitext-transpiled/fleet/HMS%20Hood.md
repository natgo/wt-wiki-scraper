The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British battlecruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

Conceptualized during World War I as the follow on to the Queen Elizabeth class super-dreadnoughts, which were some of the most powerful battleships in the world at the time, the Admiral-class underwent several redesigns, including being reshaped as a battlecruiser class after Admiral Jellicoe stated that the substantial British lead in battleships, as well as the new German Mackensen-class battlecruisers under construction meant that new British battlecruisers were a more pressing priority. After the Battle of Jutland in 1916, another redesign was ordered with a significant increase in armouring, before the first ship was finally launched in 1918. Given the convoluted design process and deficiencies found in the armour layout after Jutland, HMS Hood was the sole completed ship while the rest of the class was cancelled and, prompted by US declarations for a fleet 'second to none', plans for a new and yet more powerful class of battlecruisers, the G3 class, were drawn up instead.

Nevertheless, when the "Mighty Hood" was commissioned into the fleet in 1920, she became the largest and heaviest warship in the world, a title she held for 20 years until the 24th of August 1940, when Nazi Germany commissioned the Bismarck. Due to this, the HMS Hood became the status symbol of the might of the British Empire and the pride of the Royal Navy, up until the fateful battle at the Denmark Strait in 1941.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Hood, while not possessing very exceptional armour, is still reasonably protected, being superior in belt armour to IJN Kongō, and of course being leaps and bounds over the previous British battlecruiser in the tech tree, HMS Invincible. Her armour consists of three layers, all rolled cemented armour, extending from below the waterline to the main deck, and is inclined slightly, which marginally improves its effectiveness. The lowest layer, the main belt, is 305 mm thick and extends from the forward to aft turrets on the ship, and on par with some battleships, though it should be noted that the belt is not very tall and the majority of the hull above the waterline is not protected by it. The second layer is 178 mm thick, extending as far as the main belt, and is more than enough to shrug off cruiser shells. The top layer, 127 mm, extends from just aft of A turret to the end of the main deck.

Her deck armour consists of the three layers, being 32 mm, 51 mm, and 25 mm thick from top to bottom, 108 mm in total which should be enough to keep most shells from the deepest internals at most battle ranges in game, though the middle decks are a bit more vulnerable. Her turrets have a 381 mm thick turret face, tapering off to 305 mm and then 279 mm on the sides. Her barbettes have 305 mm above the deck, and 229 mm - 152 mm below the deck, with 127 mm further down. She also has an armoured conning tower, with 254 mm on the front and 279 mm on the sides.

Overall, her armour protection not the most impressive but certainly not bad and is certainly better than certain other capital ships.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Hood is a fairly fast capital ship, capable of 57 km/h in RB, making her slightly faster than the IJN Kongo, and slightly slower than the Scharnhorst and Kronshtadt. Her acceleration is as can be expected of a ship her size, being quite poor. In addition, her 262 m long hull means she struggles to turn, having an enormous turning radius and bleeds a lot of speed while manoeuvring.

{{main|15 inch/42 BL Mark I (381 mm)}}

Hood currently possesses the largest guns in the game, with eight 381 mm 15"/42 BL Mark I cannons mounted in four twin turrets, larger than those on the Bayern by 1 mm. She has two rounds available, 15 inch 4crh CPC, a SAPCBC shell, and 15 inch 4crh Mark XIIa APC, an APCBC shell. The SAPCBC shell, while having a smaller filler than the equivalent SAP shells on the Bayern and the Japanese 356 mm, is still the strongest SAP shell in the game, solely due to its penetration. Penetrating 487 mm at point blank, it has very minimal penetration falloff, and it still penetrates 308 mm at 15 km, while the Bayern can only penetrate 170 mm at that range, while the Japanese 356 mm SAP can't even reach that penetration at 1 km. This allows the Hood to smash any battleship designed before "all or nothing" armour schemes came into wide use, as while their main belts may be able to hold up, their weaker upper belts stand absolutely no chance, and several of these SAP shells finding their way around the realms of enemy ammunition magazines will have very entertaining results. Due to the high filler, even hits to the upper hull may cause a large enough explosion to detonate ammunition several decks below.

The APCBC shell is fairly strong with ~20 kg of TNT effective filler and decent penetration statistics, making it quite handy for punching deep into the internals of an opposing capital ship and bypassing most, if not all armour that it comes across while in regular battle ranges.

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament.

{{main|4 inch/45 Mark XVI (102 mm)}}

Hood has the standard British secondaries of seven twin 102 mm 4"/45 Mark XVI cannons. These guns do barely any damage to cruisers or capital ships and, although the SAP shell can do work on opposing destroyers, they are most useful in the role of AA batteries. Unlike other British ships using the same gun, Hood's secondaries do not get the much superior HE-VT shell, due to the fact that she was sunk before the shell was developed in real life. The time-fused shells have a habit of exploding after passing behind an aircraft rather than next to it or simply just not close enough to do damage, but it is still better to have a flak field than not.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2pdr QF Mk.VIII (40 mm)|Vickers Mk.V (12.7 mm)}}

Unlike the swarms of light AA guns that can be seen on other WW2-era capital ships, Hood's AA only consists of seven mounts due to the ship accidentally becoming an oversized reef before anti air spam came in vogue. However, three of those mounts are the glorious octuple 40 mm 2pdr QF Mk.VIII, which can spew a lovely cloud of 40mm shells into the general direction of an oncoming aircraft. The other four mounts are the more lackluster quadruple 12.7 mm Vickers Mk.V, which are essentially just there for moral support.

However, the true moral support comes in the form of five 20-barreled UP (Unrotated Projectile) rocket launchers, designed to hurl rockets which lay airborne tripwires attached to mines at enemy aircraft. While they are indicated as 'Auxiliary caliber guns' in-game, due to the fact that testing proved them as useless in-game as in real life, they were unfortunately not implemented.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.IV (533 mm)}}

Hood has twelve 533 mm Mk.IV torpedoes, the same seen on HMS Marlborough, in four launchers, two per side, near the back of the superstructure. The torpedoes are awful, slow, hard to aim, and worst of all, unlike other WW1-era ships, these launchers and their reserve torpedoes are located above the waterline in very exposed positions, meaning they are prone to explode when hit. It is not advised to take them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

HMS Hood is a strong ship on the seas of War Thunder, however her captains should not expect to be capable of tanking enemy fire like some other, more extensively protected capital ships. The Hood does have a similar main armour belt thickness, but her belt is much smaller than other capital ships, a trade-off for her superior speed. In battle, this means that Hood is much more versatile than traditional battleships, as at 57 km/h (31 kn), she is roughly 15 km/h faster than the average speed of most battleships in game. Keep in mind that Hood is very large, so it may not be advisable to enter capture points which are usually exposed, but at least she can reliably keep up with the cruisers and capture the objective in a pinch. Captains of HMS Hood should keep a close eye on her buoyancy, as she has a tendency to take on water much more rapidly than many other ships of her class, and will have a tendency to wallow and capsize very easily as well.

As for notable enemies, [[SMS Bayern]] and [[Parizhskaya kommuna|Parizhskaya Kommuna]] are both ships that will consistently be seen in battles and can do considerable damage very quickly. Bayern can be dealt with by a hit to the front ammo rack with a salvo of SAP shells, and will usually be relatively easy to deal with so long as she isn't at an angle. The Parizhskaya Kommuna can be more difficult to defeat, so it is recommended to attempt to disable turrets before attempting to deal a fatal blow. Both Bayern and Parizhskaya Kommuna will reload faster than Hood, so her captains need to be careful when taking aim, as a mistake in aim can lead to rapid retaliation from the enemy.

The main opponent, though, is the Kronshtadt, which is faster than the Hood, highly survivable and possesses fast-firing 305 mm cannons with capable HE and AP shells that are on roughly par with the Hood's AP shells. It is recommended to aim for the ammunition behind the frontal turrets and hope they will show enough broadside at a close enough range that your own AP can get though the side armour.

The British Admiral-class battlecruisers date back to 1915, when an original battleship design with characteristics similar to Queen Elizabeth-class was converted into 30 knot battlecruisers. In 1916, the project was approved and orders were placed at the shipyards, but the Battle of Jutland, which showed the full omissions in the defence of the British battlecruisers, required new improvements to the project, which dragged on until August 1917.

Although four Admiral-class battlecruisers were ordered and laid down in shipyards, only one would be completed. The one ship of the class that would see completion would become HMS Hood, named after an 18th century British admiral. The ship was laid down in the John Brown & Company shipyard in Scotland in September 1916. Following its launching in 1918 and subsequent fitting-out, HMS Hood was commissioned into the ranks of the Royal Navy in May 1920, thus also becoming the largest warship in service at the time.

Upon entering service, HMS Hood took part in several showing-the-flag and training exercises in the interwar period. In November 1923 the ship set out to circumnavigate the globe as part of The Empire Cruise, visiting ports in South Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States before returning to British waters in September 1924.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1998-035-05, Schlachtschiff Bismarck, Seegefecht.jpg|thumb|350px|right|HMS Hood's explosion with HMS Prince of Wales near, taken from [[Prinz Eugen]]]]
At the outbreak of WWII, the recently overhauled HMS Hood was operating in the area around Iceland, hunting for German vessels. After the Fall of France, HMS Hood took part in Operation Catapult - the destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940, with HMS Hood briefly duelling French battleship Dunkerque and crippling her with four hits that would have sunk the vessel had she not been close enough to the shore to beach herself. However, HMS Hood's most famous and final engagement would become that of the Battle of the Denmark Strait in which the warship, along with HMS Prince of Wales clashed with the German battleship Bismarck and the accompanying heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen. Suffering a lethal strike to one of its magazines shortly after the start of the engagement, HMS Hood blew up and sank within three minutes with catastrophic losses and only 3 survivors. Due to its popularity among the British at the time and its tragic loss during the vessel's fateful last engagement, HMS Hood retains its legendary status and is to this day one of the most well-known British warships.
