The '''HMS Hood (51), 1941''' was the first of the planned four Admiral-class battlecruisers. Ordered during World War I, her keel was notably laid down on 31 May 1916; the same day as the Battle of Jutland. Many design flaws were found in previous battlecruiser designs. This would go on to cause drastic revisions, delaying her launch until August of 1918, much longer than typical for British shipbuilding of the era. She would benefit greatly from this redesign, gaining a belt of equal strength to battleships of her era and the same battery of 8x{{Annotation|15-inch|381 mm}} guns, while still having the speed of a battlecruiser. This essentially made her the first "fast battleship" despite her battlecruiser designation. She was so powerful that during a postwar visit, the US Navy would note that she could defeat any American ship except for the Colorados (the then-latest US Battleship) in straight combat, and could easily outrun all American battleships while doing so. "The Mighty Hood" would be a symbol of the power of the British navy throughout the interwar period, and though scheduled for a massive overhaul this would be curtailed by the outbreak of war. She would famously be sent to intercept the infamous Bismarck on its first voyage, tragically being lost less than 5 minutes after the Bismarck opened fire to an extremely lucky magazine hit. This would galvanize the entire available Royal Navy to converge on and sink the Bismarck; its first voyage becoming the last.

Introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]], HMS Hood is an extremely powerful ship, the strongest battlecruiser built by the Royal Navy. Her main battery stands out with the highest penetration {{Annotation|SAP|Semi-armour piercing}} rounds found on any ship, good armour and great speed complementing the impressive firepower. Coming in her 1941 refit, this, unfortunately, predates the advent of {{Annotation|HE-VT|High-explosive variable-timed}} shells. This leaves the anti-aircraft capability lacking, though not nearly so bad as early dreadnoughts or preceding battlecruisers such as the [[HMS Invincible]]. Captains can expect Hood to perform well in all modes, but notably, the speed is a major advantage for those playing Naval Enduring Confrontation.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
HMS Hood stands out from other battlecruisers in many ways, but one of the most noticeable is in her armour protection. Typically, a battlecruiser was intended to be faster, but less armoured than the battleships of their generation. Hood instead, has equivalent protection to battleships of its generation, with a {{Annotation|12-inch|304.8 mm}} belt, inclined at 13 degrees to give it equivalent protection to the {{Annotation|13 inches|330.2 mm}} of armour found on the Queen Elizabeths. That is a drastic improvement over both the preceding battlecruisers in the Royal Navy and the battlecruisers of other nations. The battlecruiser [[IJN Kongo]] for example, has a measly {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} belt in comparison. This does fall to {{Annotation|7 inches|177.8 mm}} and then {{Annotation|5 inches|127 mm}} of armour higher on the hull, but the belt itself covers the entirety of the vitals from the foremost to sternmost turrets. The main belt will protect against all but the most powerful guns at typical battle ranges, and the lesser armoured portions of the hull don't have very many crew compartments either, leading the ship to be extremely survivable with its 1418 crew. 

The turrets are also well armoured, with {{Annotation|15 inches|381 mm}} of armour on the mantlet and {{Annotation|12 inches|304.8 mm}} on the forward half of the turret. The rear half has {{Annotation|11 inches|279.4 mm}} of armour on both the sides and rear, and the roof has {{Annotation|5 inches|127 mm}} protecting from plunging fire. This will stop battleship shells at all but point-blank range. The turret barbettes are reasonably protected above the deck with {{Annotation|12 inches|304.8 mm}} of armour above the deck, though this falls below the deck to {{Annotation|6-10 inches|152.4-254 mm}}. Notably, Hood doesn't have shell rooms in the barbettes like American battleships, lowering the chance of catastrophic fire when hit.

The deck also has multiple layers of armour as is typical on battlecruisers, the upper layer having {{Annotation|1.25 inches|31.75 mm}} of armour to trigger the fuses on shells and bombs, with a second, {{Annotation|0.75-inch|19.05 mm}} layer to stop the blast and splinters. Just in case a shell manages to get past these two layers there is also a third, {{Annotation|2-inch|50.8 mm}} plate above the magazines. Speaking of, the magazines are positioned well below the waterline and should be well protected from enemy fire unless your opponent has Adalbert Schneider as their gunnery officer. Hood also has torpedo protection with up to 250 kg of effectiveness, which should protect against most torpedoes, with notable exceptions like the Japanese [[Type 93 (610mm) (Family)|Long Lance]].

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Hood is a fairly fast capital ship, capable of 57 km/h in RB, making her slightly faster than the IJN Kongo, and slightly slower than the Scharnhorst and Kronshtadt. Her acceleration is as can be expected of a ship her size, being quite poor. In addition, her 262 m long hull means she struggles to turn, has an enormous turning radius and bleeds a lot of speed while manoeuvring.

{{main|15 inch/42 BL Mark I (381 mm)}}

The Hood possesses large-calibre guns in the game, with eight 381 mm 15"/42 BL Mark I cannons mounted in four twin turrets. She has two rounds available, 15 inch 4crh CPC, a SAPCBC shell, and 15 inch 4crh Mark XIIa APC, an APCBC shell. The SAPCBC shell, while having a smaller filler than the equivalent SAP shells on the Bayern and the Japanese 356 mm, is still the strongest SAP shell in the game, solely due to its penetration. Penetrating 487 mm at point blank, it has very minimal penetration falloff, and it still penetrates 308 mm at 15 km, while the Bayern can only penetrate 170 mm at that range, and the Japanese 356 mm SAP can't even reach that penetration at 1 km. This allows the Hood to smash any battleship designed before "all or nothing" armour schemes came into wide use, as while their main belts may be able to hold up, their weaker upper belts stand no chance, and several of these SAP shells finding their way around the realms of enemy ammunition magazines will have very entertaining results. Due to the high filler, even hits to the upper hull may cause a large enough explosion to detonate ammunition several decks below.

The APCBC shell is fairly strong with ~20 kg of TNT effective filler and decent penetration statistics, making it quite handy for punching deep into the internals of an opposing capital ship and bypassing most, if not all armour that it comes across while in regular battle ranges.

{{main|4 inch/45 Mark XVI (102 mm)}}

The Hood has the standard British secondaries of seven twin 102 mm 4"/45 Mark XVI cannons. These guns do barely any damage to cruisers or capital ships and, although the SAP shell can do work on opposing destroyers, they are most useful in the role of AA batteries. Unlike other British ships using the same gun, Hood's secondaries do not get the much superior HE-VT shell, since she was sunk before the shell was developed in reality. The time-fused shells have a habit of exploding after passing behind an aircraft rather than next to it or simply just not close enough to do damage, but it is still better to have a flak field than not.

<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>.

{{main|2pdr QF Mk.VIII (40 mm)|Vickers Mk.V (12.7 mm)}}

Unlike the swarms of light AA guns that can be seen on other WW2-era capital ships, Hood's AA only consists of seven mounts due to the ship accidentally becoming an oversized reef before anti-air spam came in vogue. However, three of those mounts are the glorious octuple 40 mm 2pdr QF Mk.VIII, which can spew a lovely cloud of 40mm shells into the general direction of an oncoming aircraft. The other four mounts are the more lacklustre quadruple 12.7 mm Vickers Mk. V, which are essentially just there for moral support.

However, the true moral support comes in the form of five 20-barreled UP (Unrotated Projectile) rocket launchers, designed to hurl rockets which lay airborne tripwires attached to mines at enemy aircraft. While they are indicated as 'Auxiliary calibre guns' in-game, since testing proved them as useless in-game as in real life, they were unfortunately not implemented.

{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.IV (533 mm)}}

The Hood has twelve 533 mm Mk.IV torpedoes, the same seen on HMS Marlborough, in four launchers, two per side, near the back of the superstructure. The torpedoes are awful, slow, hard to aim, and worst of all, unlike other WW1-era ships, these launchers and their reserve torpedoes are located above the waterline in very exposed positions, meaning they are prone to explode when hit. It is not advised to take them.

HMS Hood, as a battlecruiser, possesses exceptional speed. However unlike other battlecruisers such as the [[HMS Invincible]] that precedes it, it does not sacrifice armour nor firepower to attain this speed. She can destroy most ships with a single well-placed salvo and is completely capable of duking it out with other capital ships as well. 

;Against BCs & BBs

Whenever Hood is fighting other battlecruisers or battleships, the recommended shell for most situations differs from most other capital ships. At typical ranges in arcade and realistic battles, the {{Annotation|SAP|Semi-armour piercing}} shells will typically be able to penetrate the belt of many battleships. The {{Annotation|15-inch|381 mm}} {{Annotation|SAP|Semi-armour piercing}} actually has more penetration that many early battleships {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}} rounds. Captains should attempt to aim slightly at the waterline around the magazines (typically underneath the front or rear turrets) as the penetration and subsequent discharge of the large explosive mass will extremely often result in catastrophic damage; many "one-shots" can be expected with good placement of salvos. On the off chance that combat is taking place at further ranges; for example in naval enduring confrontation; captains should load a small amount of {{Annotation|APCBC|Armour-piercing capped ballistic capped}} for those situations, though more precise aim will be required as these have less than half the explosive mass.

;Against CAs & Below

Anything that is not a capital ship will be penetrated under almost all circumstances by the {{Annotation|SAP|Semi-armour piercing}} shell; this is the only one which should be used against cruisers and the like. Against extremely lightly armoured targets attempts should be made to engage from angles closer to the bow or stern of the enemy ship if possible. The shells have such great penetration that against lightly armoured cruisers overpenetration is common even with the {{Annotation|SAP|Semi-armour piercing}} round; this results in little damage even with a successful hit. One option when engaging multiple enemies is to utilize the ranging shot function. This fires one turret at a time, mitigating the 30 seconds the main battery takes to reload. The secondary battery also comes into usefulness here, though at only {{Annotation|4 inches|102 mm}} and with a paltry {{Annotation|0.125-inch|3.2 mm}} shield for protection, these are both very limited in capability and extremely easy to dispatch with even autocannons, let alone shell splinters. These should be left unrepaired whenever possible to not drain crew.

The British Admiral-class battlecruisers date back to 1915 when an original battleship design with characteristics similar to the Queen Elizabeth-class was converted into 30 knot battlecruisers. In 1916, the project was approved and orders were placed at the shipyards, but the Battle of Jutland, which showed the full omissions in the defence of the British battlecruisers, required new improvements to the project, which dragged on until August 1917.

Although four Admiral-class battlecruisers were ordered and laid down in shipyards, only one would be completed. The one ship of the class that would see completion would become HMS Hood, named after an 18th-century British admiral. The ship was laid down in the John Brown & Company shipyard in Scotland in September 1916. Following its launching in 1918 and subsequent fitting-out, HMS Hood was commissioned into the ranks of the Royal Navy in May 1920, thus also becoming the largest warship in service at the time.

Upon entering service, HMS Hood took part in several showing-the-flag and training exercises in the interwar period. In November 1923 the ship set out to circumnavigate the globe as part of The Empire Cruise, visiting ports in South Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States before returning to British waters in September 1924.

At the outbreak of WWII, the recently overhauled HMS Hood was operating in the area around Iceland, hunting for German vessels. After the Fall of France, HMS Hood took part in Operation Catapult - the destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940, with HMS Hood briefly duelling French battleship Dunkerque and crippling her with four hits that would have sunk the vessel had she not been close enough to the shore to beach herself. However, HMS Hood's most famous and final engagement would become that of the Battle of the Denmark Strait in which the warship, along with HMS Prince of Wales clashed with the German battleship Bismarck and the accompanying heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen. Suffering a lethal strike to one of its magazines shortly after the start of the engagement, HMS Hood blew up and sank within three minutes with catastrophic losses and only 3 survivors. Due to its popularity among the British at the time and its tragic loss during the vessel's fateful last engagement, HMS Hood retains its legendary status and is to this day one of the most well-known British warships.
