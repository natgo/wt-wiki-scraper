The '''HMS Invincible (85)''' is a member of the Invincible-class battlecruiser family. The HMS Invincible was built for the British Navy by Elswick Yard in 1907 during the first decade of the twentieth century as the world's first battlecruiser. The HMS Invincible was formally known as armoured cruisers until 1911, when they were renamed battlecruisers by an Admiralty order dated November 24, 1911. Until then, a variety of unofficial designations were used, including cruiser-battleship, dreadnought cruiser, and battlecruiser. During World War I, she played a minor role in the Battle of Heligoland Bight because she was the oldest and slowest battlecruiser in the British navy. Despite numerous hits, the HMS Invincible and her sister ship, the HMS Inflexible, sank the armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau during the Battle of the Falkland Islands. During the Battle of Jutland in 1916, she was the flagship of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron. The squadron was detached from Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet a few days before the battle for gunnery practice with the Grand Fleet, and it served as the Grand Fleet's heavy scouting force during the battle. During the battle, she was destroyed by an ammunition magazine explosion after one of her gun turrets' armour was penetrated.

Introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]], the HMS Invincible is well-protected and armed. Most of the ammunition magazines are located below the waterline, making them difficult to hit during battles. It also has a powerful secondary armament with a high rate of fire capable of dealing with close-range attacks from smaller enemy vessels. Her armour, on the other hand, is relatively weak against large-calibre armaments from other battleships. This, combined with the lack of deck armour and extremely poor anti-aircraft armament, renders the HMS Invincible extremely vulnerable to enemy aircraft. Players are advised to always stick with allies to obtain anti-aircraft fire coverage while engaging enemy vessels with its powerful main armament.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
HMS Invincible is a 20,000t vessel with 1,032 crew members, an average crew count for a battlecruiser. The ship has a 150 mm main armour belt which is backed up by 50 mm of turtleback armour and an array of coal bunkers. The main turrets have 177 mm armour on turret faces and barbettes. 

This leaves the ship reasonably resistant to 152 mm and 203 mm shells at long to medium ranges, nevertheless enemy battleships with their much larger cannons will have little trouble cleaving through your protection at any practical range. The armour is ineffective at stopping shells of a calibre larger than 283 mm. The lack of AA guns and rather thin deck armour is insufficient when it comes to fending off strike aircraft.

Whilst the belt armour does extend far enough below the waterline to give some level of protection from shallow torpedoes, the ship is still vulnerable to torpedoes which hit below the belt armour.

'''Pros:'''

* Main battery of eight 305 mm guns with access to SAP rounds can make short work of enemy cruisers, and APC can punish larger targets
* Faster than the other capital ships, inferior only to [[SMS Von der Tann]] in terms of top speed
* Belt armour can shrug off medium calibre gunfire from cruisers and destroyers, and extends below the waterline to give protection against shallow torpedoes
* Shell rooms are well below the waterline and hard to hit with gunfire
* Numerous secondary battery guns with a high rate of fire that can easily deal with close range attacks from smaller unarmoured vessels
* Has underwater torpedo launchers, which can potentially catch close targets unaware

'''Cons:'''

* Vertical armour is very weak against large calibre guns from other capital ships; battleships can often cause crippling damage
* Non-existent deck armour and extremely poor anti-aircraft armament makes the Invincible highly vulnerable to bombers
* 305 mm guns struggle to penetrate battleship belt armour beyond 10km, and the APC rounds suffer from poor post-penetration damage
* Can only fire a full broadside while parallel to an opponent - Angling the ship will only allow a broadside of 6 guns
* Secondary battery SAP shells have low penetration; the guns will struggle to damage even most light cruisers
* Main battery turret armour is thin on the roof, often resulting in disabled turrets or damage gun breeches
* Vulnerable to deep running torpedoes
* Underwater torpedoes have low range and a relatively small warhead in comparison to most deck mounted torpedoes aboard cruisers and destroyers

[[File:HMS Invincible (1907) British Battleship.jpg|thumb|600x600px|A photograph of HMS Invincible, the first British Battlecruiser, in 1907.]]
HMS Invincible was the lead ship of her class of three battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy. She was the first modern battlecruiser ever built, and pioneered the ship type, featuring less armour in exchange for more speed. Her construction led to a "battlecruiser arms race", including ships such as the German [[SMS Von der Tann|Von Der Tann]] and Derflingger classes as well as the Japanese Kongo class. During the First World War, Invincible participated in the Battle of the Heligoland Bight, as well as the Falklands Battle where she and her sister ship Inflexible sank the armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. She ultimately met her demise at the Battle of Jutland, when her magazines detonated following hits from the German force.

=== Design and development ===
Invincible, as the first battlecruiser ever built, was the brainchild of First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher, who was responsible for a wide range of innovations including the Dreadnought. The ships were designed to be fast, with a top speed of 25 knots (46 km/h), but also extremely well armed, with a main battery of 12 inch (305 mm) guns. However, this came at the expense of armour, meaning that Invincible had a weaker armour protection compared to the dreadnoughts. The massive 41 000 horsepower engines that powered the Invincible took up a massive amount of space inside the hull, requiring a reduction in armour.

Invincible, being a larger vessel than her armoured-cruiser predecessors, displaced over 20 000 tons at full load. She had an armament of eight 12 inch (305 mm) guns in four twin turrets, with one fore, one aft, and two on beam positions. The turrets were placed in a position so that all four turrets could fire on a broadside. Invincible carried a secondary armament of twelve 4 inch 40 QF naval guns in single mounts, placed across the fore and rear superstructures. She carried a single 76 mm and 47 mm gun for anti-aircraft defence, as well as four 450 mm torpedoes. Invincible was laid down in April of 1906, and launched a year later in 1907. She was fully commissioned in 1909 and entered service with the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the British Grand Fleet.

=== Operational History ===
Invincible entered service with the British Grand Fleet and participated in fleet manoeuvres along with the rest of the fleet. However, it was apparent during her early service that her main turrets were problematic as the faulty electric turret horizontal drives prevented them from turning properly. As a result, the battlecruiser spent much of late 1913 and early 1914 in dock, receiving new, hydraulic turret drives to replace her electric ones. She was also fitted with a new ranging fire director, but this had not been completed by the time of the outbreak of the First World War.

==== Heligoland Bight and the Falklands ====
Following the start of the First World War, Invincible saw her first action at the Battle of Heligoland Bight. There, she fired 18 rounds at the crippled cruiser Cöln, but failed to obtain hits. Later, Invincible participated in a more important action, the Battle of the Falklands. As part of the British West Indies squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock, she steamed from Port Stanley (in the Falklands) with her sister ship Inflexible to intercept the German squadron led by Admiral Von Spee; Spee's cruiser squadron, led by armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, attempted to attack the British base at Port Stanley hours before. As the battlecruisers had a 5-knot advantage over the German armoured cruisers, they quickly caught up and began straddling the German cruisers with 12 inch shells. After a several hour long battle, both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were sunk, the former with no survivors. Invincible was hit numerous times, but suffered no significant damage.

After the Falklands battle, Invincible returned to Port Stanley for repairs, followed by a more lengthy refit at Gibraltar. During this time, her ranging director was completed (it had been left unfinished with the outbreak of war) and her funnel was extended to reduce the amount of smoke entering the bridge and forward superstructure.

==== Battle of Jutland and sinking ====
[[File:InvincibleBlowingUpJutland1916.jpg|thumb|500x500px|HMS Invincible blowing up after a German shell detonated her ammunition magazines.]]
Invincible ultimately met her demise at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, just a year after she sank the cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at the Falklands. In May of that year, she was assigned to Admiral Beatty's battlecruiser group and ordered to cruise into the north seas to intercept a potential breakout of the German fleet. Soon after, Invincible, along with her sister ships Inflexible and Indomitable, spotted a group of seven enemy ships including two armoured cruisers and promptly fired upon them. They succeeded in crippling the cruiser Wiesbaden with a hit to the engine room, as well as a similar heavy hit to the cruiser Pillau.

Soon after, Beatty's battlecruisers spotted the German battlecruiser line, and promptly opened fire on the battlecruisers Lutzow and Derfflinger. Invincible hit Lutzow twice beneath the waterline, which would eventually lead to her demise. However, she ended up directly in front of Lutzow and Derfllinger, who fired several salvoes at her. One of these shots hit the ship's midships 12 inch shell magazines, which exploded and blew the ship in half. Almost her entire crew of 1026 were killed, including her commanding officer Rear Admiral Horace Hood; six survivors were rescued by escorting destroyers. Hood's widow would later launch the battlecruiser/fast battleship HMS Hood, the heaviest battleship in the world for 20 years. 

Invincible lies at a depth of 55 metres in the North Sea, cut in half by the massive magazine explosion that doomed her. Her wreck is protected by the Protection of Military Remains act of 1986.

=== [[wt:en/news/6974-development-heroes-of-jutland-hms-invincible-en|Devblog]] ===
HMS Invincible was laid down in April 1906 as the lead ship of her class of three new armoured cruisers, intended to replace the preceding Minotaur-class. The ship was launched a year later and completed in March 1909, subsequently being commissioned into service with the Royal Navy. Thereafter, HMS Invincible took part in fleet manoeuvres and several reviews before being sent to drydock for refit. In 1911, the warship was officially redesignated into a battlecruiser, thus becoming the first ship of this kind.

In 1913, HMS Invincible was ordered to the dockyard once more to replace her electrically powered turret traverse mechanisms with hydraulic ones in order to fix ongoing problems and make the ship battle-worthy. However, while works were still being undertaken, the declaration of war on Germany in August 1914 signalled the start of WWI and HMS Invincible was quickly recommissioned.

Already at the outbreak of the conflict, HMS Invincible saw herself in the thick of the action, engaging German ships at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in late August 1914. Later that year, in December, HMS Invincible, along with her sister ship HMS Inflexible, took part in the Battle of the Falkland Islands, sinking the two German armoured cruisers, Gneisenau and Scharnhorst, during the engagement.

HMS Invincible also took part in what would become her last engagement - the well-known Battle of Jutland in May 1916. During the battle, HMS Invincible was struck by fire coming from the German battlecruisers Lützow and Derfflinger, detonating her midships magazine and causing the warship to break in half.
