== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British battleship {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]], but was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/https://warthunder.com/en/news/8880-shop-may-sale-in-the-gaijin-store-enn|2024 May sales]]. It has since been reintroduced, purchasable in-game for Golden Eagles {{GE}} for the [[wt:en/news/9123-shop-hms-iron-duke-is-back-on-the-anniversary-of-its-launch-en|2024 "Anniversary of its Launch"]] mini event.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
HMS Iron Duke, like other British battleships of this time period, uses a distributed armour scheme. Her main main belt has a thickness of {{Annotation|12 inches|304.8 mm}}, slightly angled to increase effectiveness. This falls off to {{Annotation|9 inches|228.6 mm}} and then {{Annotation|8 inches|203.2 mm}} on the hull, before finally ending with {{Annotation|6 inches|152.4 mm}} on the secondary armour deck. The main belt will be resistant to most battleships of the rank, but the higher ranked ships like the [[SMS Bayern]] or [[IJN Fuso]] will be able to penetrate it at most ranges, and the thinner armour above the main belt will be easily penetrated by all capital ships. Iron Duke has no dedicated torpedo protection, though it does have coal bunkers which can absorb some hits.

The turrets are fairly well armoured, though not to the extreme of something like the [[USS Nevada]] with her {{Annotation|18 inches|457.2 mm}} of angled turret armour. HMS Iron Duke has 2 layers of turret armour, with the first coming in at {{Annotation|11 inches|279.4 mm}} of armour, covering the front, rear and sides and a second {{Annotation|3-inch|76.2 mm}} layer contained within. This should be more than enough armour to stop most shells at anything but extremely close range. The top of the turrets also have multiple layers of armour, with both a {{Annotation|3-inch|76.2 mm}} and {{Annotation|4-inch|101.6 mm}} plate protecting from plunging fire. The turret barbette armour ranges from {{Annotation|9-10 inches|228.6-254 mm}}, which unfortunately means that every battleship will easily be able to destroy the ammo elevators, though these won't explode when hit. The magazines are placed well below the waterline, and have multiple layers of deck armour to detonate plunging fire and shield the magazine from hits, with two {{Annotation|1-inch|25.4 mm}} and a {{Annotation|1.25-inch|31.75 mm}} plate providing ample protection.
