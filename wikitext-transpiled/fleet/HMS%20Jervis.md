The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is J-class destroyer named after Admiral John Jervis. Jervis was laid down on 26th August 1937 and commissioned on 8th May 1939. Unlike other J-class destroyers, Jervis' role was to serve as a flotilla leader for the J-class destroyers forming the 7th Destroyer Flotilla. She was identical to K-class destroyer leader Kelly and N-class destroyer leader Napier. On the second day after war broke out, September 2nd 1939, Jervis managed to capture a blockade runner and two more until the end of 1939. She continued to serve in Home Waters until 1940 when she was sent to the Mediterranean where she served until late 1943. In 1941, she took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan where she torpedoed and sunk Italian heavy cruiser [[Zara]] with three torpedoes that hit her magazines and caused fatal explosion. After that, a boarding party from Jervis captured the crippled heavy cruiser [[Pola]], took off the wounded and let HMS Nubian torpedo and sink the heavily damaged ship. She also participated in the Battle of Crete and the First Battle of Sirte. On her way back to Alexandria, she was badly damaged by Italian human torpedo attack and had to undergo a six-week long repair. During 1942, Jervis took part in the Second Battle of Sirte. She also supported Allied landings on Sicily, Anzio, and other places in the Mediterranean. She was decommissioned in September 1944 after taking part in the Normandy landings. She was recommissioned in May 1945 and served in the Mediterranean again until May 1946 when she was placed in reserve. She was sold for scrap in 1954. Jervis was awarded 13 battle honours for her service, two other ships that also served with Jervis matched that number, namely HMS Orion and HMS Nubian, with a single ship exceeding it: the flagship of Mediterranean fleet, HMS Warspite, with 15 to her name.

HMS Jervis is a British destroyer introduced in [[Update "New Power"]]. Her armament consists of three twin 120 mm Mk. XII turrets on CPXIX mounts with 12 rounds per minute utilizing first stage ammunition, after that one is depleted, the rate of fire drops to still very impressive 10 rounds per minute. Her anti-aircraft weaponry consists of a single quadruple 40 mm QF Mk.IIc autocannon, four twin 20 mm Oerlikon Mk.V autocannons, and two single 20 mm Oerlikon Mk.II autocannons. She is also armed with single quintuple and single quadruple Mk. IX torpedo launchers with 533 mm Mk. IX torpedoes with base range of 10 km, above average speed of 76 km/h and one of the heaviest payloads of 587.2 kg TNT equivalent. Jervis suffers from the same issue as many other Royal Navy destroyers, namely very vulnerable magazines above the waterline under the forward turrets that could after single hit lead to catastrophic magazine detonation. Utilizing manoeuvrability and speed to evade enemy shells is advised.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
In real life, HMS Jervis is famous for not suffering any crew loss during her extensive career in World War II, despite occasionally taking serious battle damage. However, the "Lucky J" does not have her immense luck to save her crew from incoming fire in the game.

The Jervis' protection is practically nonexistent. She has only 3.2 mm of casemate armour to protect her main guns, and her Oerlikon autocannon mounts ironically have thicker (but still bad) gun shields of 12.7 mm in thickness. Simply put, the Jervis will take full damage from any of the large cannon calibres, and even small autocannons can pose a threat to her survival.

To make matters worse, almost every vital part of the Jervis is exposed to enemy fire to an extent, her engines, and transmissions are sitting above the waterline with no fuel tanks to absorb incoming shots, and are thus easy to knock out. Her ready ammo racks are fatal weak spots, as they are placed just nearby the main turrets. Any HE shells that would detonate around her turrets will most likely detonate them, causing severe damage to the ship.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Being a destroyer with relatively low displacement, the Jervis is very fast and manoeuvrable. Due to her very poor protection, using her mobility is a key to survive.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|4.7 inch/45 Mk.XII (120 mm)}}

The Jervis is equipped with six 120 mm 4.7 inch/45 Mk.XII cannons, mounted in three twin turrets in A-Bs-X setup. These guns have very good traverse speed, and the placement of the turrets allow the B and X turrets to completely turn around, which will come in handy when using it with quick turning to avoid incoming shots.

The 120 mm guns have a short reload time of 5 seconds (ace crew) and feature four types of ammunition; HE, SAP, HE-TF, and HE-VT. The HE shell is reliable against destroyers and some light cruisers, while the SAP shell is only useful for dealing internal damage at close range due to poor penetration. As the turrets have fast traverse speed and good coverage, the anti-air shells will be useful for engaging enemy planes at range if you wish to.

{{:4.7 inch/45 Mk.XII (120 mm)/Ammunition|4.7 inch HE Mk.VIIA, 4.7 inch SAP Mk.VA, 4.7 inch HE-TF Mk.VIIA, 4.7 inch HE-VT Mk.VIIA}}

=== Secondary armament ===

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament.

If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2pdr QF Mk.IIc (40 mm)}}

The Jervis is outfitted with four 40 mm Pom-pom autocannons in a single quadruple turret as a secondary armament. The turret is located at the midship section, just behind the funnel. The turret can fully rotate but is unable to fire directly at the front and the rear, thus limiting its usage to enemies coming from above or the broadsides of the ship. While the placement of the Pom-pom turret restricts its usage, it can be very deadly against any boats or aircraft within its range.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mark V (20 mm)}}

For dedicated anti-air defence, the Jervis features ten 20 mm Oerlikon autocannons, with two pairs of dual-mounted Mk V on the bridge and between torpedo launchers and another pair of single-mounted Mk II at the stern. The placement of the guns provides wide coverage against surface and aerial threats, though it is always recommended to man the guns yourself if the enemy gets too close.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.IX** (533 mm)}}

The Jervis is loaded with 9 x 533 mm Mk.IX** torpedoes. These torpedoes have 587.2 kg of TNT explosive as the warhead, which is noticeably more powerful than the variants found on British cruisers, and is enough to tackle all targets the Jervis will face. The torpedoes also have a decent top speed of 76 km/h without modification. As the torpedoes have a maximum range of 10 km which is within the range that the Jervis will usually engage, and the torpedo mode modification only adds 3.7 km of extra range, it is advised to uninstall these modifications to increase the torpedo's effectiveness.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Jervis is essentially a glass cannon that is good at delivering damage, but bad at taking it. Due to her abysmal protection, rushing into the enemy or trading shots with them is essentially a suicide, as most of your critical modules can be quickly taken out before you can take your enemy down. Instead, play as a support ship and stay behind your allies, your guns, and torpedoes are a great asset for taking down destroyers and harassing enemy cruisers, and your anti-air defence will keep any of the inbound aircraft or PT boats at bay. With HMS Jervis, you shouldn't travel in a straight line for too long as the enemy will target you, instead using your good mobility and turret traverse speed to avoid incoming fire and do a quick snapshot of them.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

HMS Jervis, J-class Flotilla Leader, was a destroyer of the J class. Commissioned just before the outbreak of war, Jervis saw extensive service in the Mediterranean and Atlantic theatres. She participated in multiple major engagements in the Mediterranean, and later participated in the D-Day landings of 1944. Jervis was retired at the end of the war, and later scrapped. She was highly decorated and received 13 battle honours for her service in the Second World War. Jervis also gained a reputation for being extremely lucky, as she never lost a single crew member during her 5 and a half years of service.<ref name=":0">D-Day Encyclopedia. (2020)</ref><ref name=":1">Smith, G. (2004)</ref>

=== Design and Development ===
[[File:HMS Jervis on sea trials.jpg|thumb|HMS Jervis on sea trials, early 1939.]]
The Jervis, as a member of the J class, was designed as a smaller follow-up to the preceding [[Tribal (Family)|Tribal-class]] destroyers. Being smaller, the J class had a stronger balance between guns and torpedo armament, compared to the "gunship-style" Tribal-class destroyers. Jervis, in particular, was fitted with additional command space to accommodate the Flotilla commander. Jervis displaced 2600 tons, and was capable of 36 knots (66 km/h).<ref name=":0" /> Her main armament consisted of six 4.7-inch (120 mm) guns in three dual turrets, two mounted at the bow and one at the stern.<ref name=":0" /> She also carried numerous anti-aircraft defences as well as eight 533 mm torpedo tubes in two quad-mounts.<ref name=":0" />

Jervis was laid down in mid-1937 and was launched in September 1938. She was completed and commissioned in May 1939, just months before the outbreak of the Second World War.

=== Service history ===
Following her completion and commissioning, the Jervis served as the flagship of the 7th Destroyer fleet. She first served as a patrol vessel in the North Sea, hunting for axis blockade runners; however, she collided with a freighter in March 1940 and was dry docked for repairs.<ref name=":1" /> Once the repairs were completed, she was assigned to the Mediterranean squadron, where she saw extensive service. She escorted convoys to Malta, participated in shore bombardment missions, and provided screening services to the British Mediterranean fleet.<ref name=":1" />

In 1941, Jervis served in the Battle of Cape Matapan, where she sank the crippled Italian cruiser [[Zara]] and boarded Zara's sister ship Pola. She later participated in the battles of Crete and Sirte, where she managed to survive undamaged despite heavy allied losses.<ref name=":1" /> Later on, she was immobilized for six weeks by an Italian manned torpedo.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

In 1944, Jervis was reassigned to the British Atlantic fleet, and provided fire support for the forces landing at Gold Beach for the D-Day landings. She was thereafter decommissioned for a refit, which gave her additional anti-aircraft protection.<ref name=":1" /> She returned to the Mediterranean after her recommissioning, and served as a patrol ship as World War II drew to a close. Following the end of the war, she was laid up in reserve and used by the cadets as a training ship. After being used for explosive tests, Jervis was given to the ship-breakers for scrap.<ref name=":1" />

HMS Jervis is known as an extremely lucky ship: despite being active for almost the entirety of the war and having served in 13 major naval engagements, she never lost a single crew member.<ref name=":0" /> In fact, she was one of just two J-class ships to survive the war. She received 13 battle honours for her service during the Second World War, making her one of the most highly decorated British warships in modern history.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
