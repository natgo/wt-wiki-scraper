== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]].

HMS Kelvin is a member of the trio of J, K, and N classes of destroyers. She is modeled as she was when originally completed in 1939, while her relatives [[HMAS Nepal]] and [[HMS Jervis]] are modeled with their wartime refits. Thus, the Kelvin has weaker anti-aircraft defences than her relatives, in exchange for a heavier torpedo broadside.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Kelvin has absolutely no armour protection other than the gun shields. The main guns have 3.2 mm-thick shields, which will protect against nothing more than light machine gun bullets, while the Vickers .50 cal machine guns have 12.7 mm shields. The hull is standard 16 mm steel, which is resistant to low calibre HE and machine guns, but not much more.

The bow main gun ammunition racks are located slightly below the waterline, but the ones in the stern, as well as the bow secondary ammunition storage, are exposed above the waterline. This makes the Kelvin very vulnerable to ammunition detonation from hits at the waterline, and caution should be taken.

The machinery of the Kelvin is also exposed above the waterline, and she is vulnerable to engine damage as well. In addition, the Kelvin has only one funnel, so if it is destroyed, her mobility will be substantially crippled.

The Kelvin has a crew of 208, which is unremarkable compared to most other destroyers, and substantially worse than the German destroyers, as well as some American ones.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Kelvin has a respectable top speed, and she will easily keep pace with most other destroyers. Her acceleration is good, and she will easily reach her top speed.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|4.7 inch/45 Mk.XII (120 mm)}}

The Kelvin's main armament consists of six QF 4.7-inch Mk. XII guns, four of them in dual-gun bow A and B turrets, with another two in a stern dual-gun X turret. The upper B and X turrets have unrestricted traverse, while the lower A turret is restricted to 145° to either side. Because of this, the Kelvin can bring all of its gun turrets to bear on a target ahead while showing very little broadside. This can make her harder to hit, especially at range and on the move. The maximum elevation is only 40°, which makes them of limited use against aircraft. The traverse speed of the turrets is also somewhat below average.

The guns have a rate of fire of 12 rounds/minute while the 30-round first-stage ammunition rack is not empty, dropping to 10 rounds/minute when they are empty.

The 4.7-inch gun can fire HE, HE-TF, SAP, and HE-VT. HE-VT is flatly superior to HE and HE-TF, hence there is no point using the latter two once HE-VT has been unlocked. It is also very effective against aircraft, though the poor gun elevation means that the Kelvin will often not be able to engage attacking aircraft with the main guns. SAP is useful against armoured targets such as American destroyers with belt armour or light cruiser armour at closer ranges. Due to the smaller calibre, the shells of the 4.7-inch gun generally lack in explosive filler compared to contemporary guns such as the American 5"/38 or the German 12.8 cm guns.

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament.

If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2pdr QF Mk.VIII (40 mm)}}

The secondary armament of the Kelvin consists of a quadruple 2-pounder 'pom-pom' mount. This weapon is mounted amidships, behind the funnel, and is primarily an anti-aircraft weapon. However, it can be very deadly against coastal craft due to its high rate of fire and relatively potent 40 mm rounds.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Vickers Mk.V (12.7 mm)}}

In addition to the 'pom-pom' mount, the Kelvin carries two quadruple Vickers .50 cal heavy machine gun turrets. The heavy machine guns have a high rate of fire, but a fairly long reload. It is effective against aircraft at close range, as well as against unarmoured coastal attack craft, but is mostly useless against armoured targets or other destroyers.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.IX (533 mm)|Y-gun Mk.VII depth charge}}

The Kelvin has two quintuple 21-inch torpedo tube mountings located amidships, allowing for a respectable torpedo salvo. Like all British destroyers, however, these mountings have very restricted fields-of-fire, requiring the target to be almost directly abeam of the ship. They also traverse quite slowly and are thus quite risky to use, unless the torpedoes are being fired while out of combat or against unaware opponents.

The 21-inch Mark IX torpedo itself is a rather respectable weapon, with a good range of 9.6 km and a large explosive warhead of 340 kg. It is considerably slower than the American 21-inch Mark 15 and German G7a torpedo, though it has almost double the range and a much larger warhead than the American weapon. This range can be extended further by installing the torpedo mode modification, if necessary.

The Kelvin also has two 'Y-gun' depth charge throwers located behind the aft torpedo tubes. These cannot be aimed, and are thus very rarely useful at all.

The K class, HMS Kelvin (F37) was a British destroyer of the K class, built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. Designed as a follow-up to the preceding [[HMS Jervis|J class]], the ship was designed as a Tribal-class destroyer with more focus on guns and less focus on torpedoes. HMS Kelvin was laid down in October 1937 and commissioned by November 1939. She saw some service during the Second World War, including the task of transporting British Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the English Channel after the D-Day invasion. HMS Kelvin survived the war, and was scrapped by 1949.

=== Design ===
The J, K and N class destroyers were a group of three classes of destroyers built as a follow-up to the preceding Tribal class. At that point in time, the British Admiralty experienced a shift in destroyer doctrine which favoured guns over torpedoes - this trend was continued through the war until the introduction of the Battle class. HMS Kelvin was armed with a main armament of three twin 4.7 inch (119 mm) QF Mark XII dual-purpose main guns, with two fore and one aft. She also carried a secondary armament of a single quad pom-pom anti-aircraft gun, along with two quadruple 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine guns. HMS Kelvin did not carry any torpedo tubes, but could carry depth charges for anti-submarine warfare. Powered by steam turbines delivering 44,000 shp, she could make 36 knots (67 km/h).

=== Operational History ===
The HMS Kelvin was commissioned by November 1939 and entered service with the British Navy in the British 5th Destroyer Flotilla. She would later scuttle the destroyer HMS Ivanhoe after the latter struck a mine during the Texel disaster. She escorted the battleship HMS Revenge as she bombarded the port of Cherbourg, and was subsequently reassigned to the British Mediterranean fleet under Admiral James Somerville.

After arriving in the Mediterranean theatre, HMS Kelvin<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first action was to bombard the town of Benghazi with her sister ships Kashmir, Kelly, and Kipling. She survived this action with little loss of life, but needed repairs and was thus sent all the way to Bombay in India. By March 1942, she had returned to the Mediterranean, and took part in the Second Battle of Sirte, where her convoy was attacked by a formidable Italian force including the battleship Littorio.

Later in 1942, Kelvin contributed to the sinking of the Italian torpedo boat Lupo, alongside the J-class destroyers Jervis, Janus, and Javelin. In January 1943, she bombarded the port city of Zuwara which culminated in the Battle off Zuwara, where the destroyers sank an Italian convoy attempting to evacuate from Tripoli. She then left the Mediterranean theatre yet again, to be refitted back in the UK. In June 1944, she transported the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, along with various other foreign leaders, across the English Channel to inspect the troops that had landed in the D-Day landings. She then returned to the Mediterranean theatre, where she would stay for the rest of the war. HMS Kelvin survived the war and was broken up for scrap in 1949; she earned eight battle stars for her service during the Second World War.
