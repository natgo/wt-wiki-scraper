== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Direct Hit"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7350-event-export-order-en|2021 Export Order]] event.

A Tribal-class destroyer, HMS Mohawk is unique in that it carries a fourth main turret, allowing for increased firepower over its sisters, in exchange, it has a smaller AA battery.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

Mohawk's mobility should be deemed adequate but not perfect. The Tribal-class was repurposed as fleet destroyers, and as such, the mobility performs fine enough to attend to the needs of flexible anti-air support for cruisers fleets, or while performing a flanking attack throughout naval engagements. The Tribal-class was fitted with three Admiralty three-drum boilers that powered two Parsons geared turbines generating 34,000 hp which translates into 67 km/h, reached in about 28 seconds.

The top speed is averagely on par or in few cases inferior against most German destroyers at ranks II and III. Thus it is likely no real mobility advantage can be played over German counterparts. Versus similarly ranked Japanese or Italian destroyers, the opposite occurs. Though minimal in some instances, the Mohawk might have the upper hand in catching up with enemy destroyers such as [[IJN Yuudachi]], [[IJN Kiyoshimo]] and [[IJN Ayanami]].

Do not forget about some other destroyers as the Japanese [[IJN Shimakaze]] and the Soviet [[Tashkent]] and [[Moskva]]: these feature outstanding top speed over 80 km/h. Therefore, it is crucial to quickly assess these mobility disparities when gunnery is leading a deadly salvo on such swift enemies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* A powerful set of four twin 4.7-inch cannons (most RN Destroyers only got 3 sets)
* Primary guns have great precision even at long ranges (~10 km)
* Crew size is slightly above average, an usual trait of the battle-ready [[Tribal (Family)|Tribal-class]]
* Dual-purpose guns; HE-VT shells for primary and secondary guns makes it easy to destroy aircraft
* Amongst the fastest Bluewater ships on the British naval tree

'''Cons:'''

* Carries only 4 torpedoes and limited depth charges
* Short-ranged auxiliary 12.7 mm machine guns
* Ammo racks are easily detonated by SAP or APCBC shells near the waterline; no armour present in the area

== History ==

The destroyer Mohawk was laid down as one of the Tribal class destroyers on July 16th, 1936 at the Southampton shipyard. Like all destroyers of the series, the Mohawk differed from most ships of her class in high firepower of the main calibre and good torpedo armament, while maintaining a displacement under the London Treaty - no more than 1,850 tons. Immediately after construction, Mohawk joined the destroyer flotilla in the Mediterranean. Before WWII started, the destroyer performed training, diplomatic and civilian missions in the Mediterranean Sea.

After the war began, Mohawk went back to her native waters, where on October 16th, 1939, during the first Luftwaffe raid on the British Isles, she suffered from a nearby bomb explosion, fragments of which killed 15 crew members and mortally wounded the captain. During World War II, the destroyer began active combat service in Norwegian waters and then in the Mediterranean against the Italian fleet. As part of the 14th destroyer flotilla, Mohawk participated in the defeat of the Italians at Cape Matapan, where destroyers sank the heavily damaged cruisers Pola and Zara, after rescuing the remnants of their crews. On the morning of April 16th, 1941, the 14th Flotilla attacked an Italian convoy near Tunisia. The crippled and sinking leader of the escort, the Italian destroyer Luca Tarigo, was able to launch two torpedoes at the Mohawk in manual mode. Both torpedoes reached their target - the first hit the stern and damaged the controls, the second led to the explosion of the stern boiler and the deck breaking in two. The destroyer sank almost immediately, killing 41 crew members.
