<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

The Southampton is the lead ship of the Southampton-class of light cruisers, a part of what became known as the Town-class that were the most capable light cruisers available to the Royal Navy at the outbreak of World War II. Compared to previous British light cruisers such as the [[HMNZS Leander|Leander]] and [[HMS Arethusa|Arethusa]], the Southampton is a substantial advance in terms of firepower and protection.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Southampton has much better overall protection than previous British light cruisers. The machinery is protected by a thick 114 mm citadel belt, with 63.5 mm ends. This provides good protection against even heavy cruiser guns at longer ranges when angled. However, the deck armour over the machinery is only 31 mm thick, which is mostly enough to protect against long range light cruiser fire, but not much more. 

The main gun magazines are protected within armoured boxes, with 114 mm upper and 76 mm lower side protection. The roofs of the boxes are protected by 51 mm of armour. Altogether, the magazines are very well protected against light cruiser fire, and are difficult to penetrate even with heavy cruiser guns at range and when angled. The shell rooms adjacent to the magazines are much more lightly protected, at only 25.4 mm anti-fragmentation armour, but a hit there, while causing serious damage, will not be immediately fatal to the ship, unlike a magazine penetration.

The rest of the ship is much more lightly protected. The light turret and barbette protection remains a serious Achilles heel of the ship, like on preceding British light cruisers. It is only 25 mm thick, making even destroyer AP/SAP/Common shells a potential threat. Like almost all British cruisers, the Southampton also has an open bridge with only minimal splinter protection (6-9 mm). This makes her very vulnerable to getting disabled and losing crew to hits to the bridge, especially with HE shells.

The Southampton has a crew complement of 748 men, which is small compared to other light cruisers like the [[USS Cleveland]] or her half-sister-ship [[HMS Belfast|Belfast]].

<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Southampton is a little slower compared to the other British cruisers at the same BR, though her speed remains fairly respectable for a ship of her size. Her handling and acceleration are about average.

{{main|6 inch/50 BL Mark XXIII (152 mm)}}
The main armament of the Southampton consists of four turrets with triple BL 6-inch Mark XXIII guns. These guns have a high sustained rate of fire at 8 rounds/minute with the best possible crew. Due to the large number of barrels and high rate of fire, the Southampton is capable of throwing nearly 100 6-inch shells per minute at a target. The gun accuracy at medium ranges is reasonable, although the horizontal dispersion is quite noticeable. These guns can also elevate to 45 degrees, which allows them to be used to reasonable effect against aircraft, especially once HE-VT is available. The turrets all have a below-average traverse arc of only 145 degrees to each side, which means that the Southampton has to show more broadside than most other light cruisers in order to unmask all her guns.

The main guns have a selection of four shells: HE, HE-TF, HE-VT, and CPBC. The explosive fillers for the HE, HE-TF, and HE-VT shells are identical (a respectable ~4 kg TNT), with the HE shell being slightly better at setting fires to ships, while the HE-TF and HE-VT have higher shrapnel counts and can burst on air targets. There is little point in using the HE-TF shell once HE-VT is unlocked, since the latter is not dependent on accurate rangefinding and is therefore a much superior anti-aircraft shell. The CPBC semi-armour piercing shell combines a decent filler for a 6-inch shell (~1.87 kg TNT equivalent) with respectable penetration, and is the shell of choice against enemy cruisers.

{{main|4 inch/45 Mark XVI (102 mm)}}

The Southampton's secondary armament consists of eight QF 4-inch Mark XVI guns in four twin gun mounts, with two mounts on each side of the ship. These guns are most effective against aircraft, especially with HE-VT, although their high rate of fire (20 rounds per minute maximum each) can also make them a threat to coastal craft and even lighter destroyers.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===

<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>.

If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2pdr QF Mk.VIII (40 mm)|Vickers Mk.V (12.7 mm)}}

Complementing the 4-inch and 6-inch guns in the anti-aircraft role are two quadruple QF 2-pounder Mark VIII "pom-pom" mounts located on each side of the first funnel and two quadruple Vickers .50 cal heavy machine gun mounts on each side of the rear mast. The "pom-poms" can put out a lethal amount of 40 mm shells against aircraft or coastal craft that dare approach within effective range, but they have a substantial reload time once empty. The heavy machine guns are less effective, but can still be a deterrent at close ranges.

=== Additional armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.IX (533 mm)}}

The Southampton has two triple torpedo tubes, one on each side of the ship. These fire the 21-inch Mark IX torpedo which has a speed and range of 67 km/h and 9.6 km, respectively (56 km/h and 12.34 km with the torpedo mode installed). The warhead is a hefty 340 kg TNT, and can be a threat to even battleships.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Southampton is a quantum leap over the previous British light cruisers in terms of firepower. She has 50% more main gun firepower than her predecessor, the [[HMNZS Leander|Leander]]. The combination of a large number of barrels, high rate of fire, and decent shell explosive fillers makes her a very deadly opponent at short/medium ranges, especially to destroyers. She also maintains a respectable torpedo armament, allowing her to threaten even battleships if they get within effective torpedo range.

The protection is a bit more of a mixed bag. It is very hard to quickly destroy the Southampton due to her excellent magazine and belt protection, but the thin turret armour and unarmoured bridge mean that she is quite easy to disable and will tend to lose a lot of crew through turret and bridge disables. This is further exacerbated by the small crew complement. The ship itself has quite a large profile, and thus it is harder to take advantage of cover. She also has somewhat poor turret traverse arcs, which means she has to show a lot of broadside in order to use all of her turrets.

As she is depicted in her early-war configuration, the anti-aircraft suite of the Southampton is quite underwhelming, especially compared to the previous British cruisers and her sister-ship [[HMS Liverpool|Liverpool]]. This can be compensated to some extent with the main and secondary guns and good aim, since they have access to effective HE-VT shells, but the close-range anti-aircraft guns should not be relied upon, especially under AI control.

It is important to note that the Southampton can be matched against battleships at its battle rating. The 6-inch guns are mostly ineffective against battleships beyond setting fire to them with HE, so it is best to avoid fighting them head-to-head at all costs. The torpedoes are also an option if a battleship carelessly allows the Southampton to get within effective range.

The Southampton has a hangar, catapult, and handling facilities for aircraft, but is presently not capable of launching seaplanes.

[[File:HMS Southampton 1937.jpg|thumb|470x470px|HMS Southampton before her refit in 1937.]]
The HMS Southampton, pennant number 83, is a light cruiser of the Town class. Launched in 1936, she went on to see service during the Second World War. She initially served as the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser squadron of the Home Fleet, and later participated in several engagements with German vessels. She was reassigned to the Mediterranean in October of 1940. However, in January 1941, she was bombed by Italian aircraft and suffered crippling damage. As a result, she was scuttled with torpedoes from her escorts.<ref name=":1">Helgason, G. (1995)</ref>

=== Design and development ===
The Southampton was a member of the Town class, a group of light cruisers built in the 1930s. Initially intended to be built as Arethusa-class cruisers, the design was changed after the construction of the American Brooklyn-class and Japanese Mogami-class ships. The vessels were 180 metres long and displaced 11 000 tons, as they weren't regulated by the Washington naval treaty.<ref name=":0">RBJ. (2008)</ref> The ships carried an armament of twelve 152 mm guns in four triple turrets, a big upgrade from the six-gun Arethusas. The ships also carried numerous anti-aircraft defenses, and two triple torpedo launchers. She was capable of 32 knots (59 km/h).<ref name=":0" />

The HMS Southampton was laid down on November 11th 1934, and launched on March 10th 1936.<ref name=":0" /> She was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy in March of 1937.<ref name=":0" />

=== Operational history ===
Following her commissioning, the Southampton entered service with the 2nd Cruiser squadron of the British Home Fleet. After the outbreak of the Second World War, she participated in the hunts for the German merchant Johannes Molkenbuhr and the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. During this time, she was damaged twice; first by a 500kg bomb while she was laid up at Rosyth, and later by a German air attack off the coast of Norway.<ref name=":1" />

In November of 1940, Southampton sailed for the Mediterranean. She later participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento and escorted resupply missions to Malta. However, on January 11th of 1941, she was attacked by twelve Stukas of the Luftwaffe. Hit by two bombs, the ship caught fire and suffered severe damage. With 80 sailors dead and no electrical power, the decision was made to scuttle the ship. Thus, she was sunk by four torpedoes from the cruiser Orion and a single torpedo from her sister ship Gloucester.<ref name=":1" />
