== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The hull of the Ha-Go is made up of 6 mm steel, with no additional armour protection. In addition, it only has a crew of 10, which overall does make it a fairly weak vessel. It is quite low down in the water, which may cause enemy boats to miss the hull at the longer ranges but this really is the only passive advantage the Ha-Go has in terms of survivability. At the closer ranges though the vast majority of enemy vessels will be able to tear through the hull of the Ha-Go fairly easily, it's also very vulnerable to high calibre cannons as well, and can be hull broken if it takes a shot from one of these cannons.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The speed and mobility of this vessel is notably one of its weakest assets, it can reach 34 km/h in AB and 25 km/h in RB. It's fairly unresponsive to changes in speed but not necessarily changes in direction, it takes a long time to accelerate and decelerate but it can turn and change direction fairly easily, which is useful for maintaining angles of attack for the weaponry. The main detriment relative to the speed though is in regards to its survivability, as this vessel is relatively unarmoured, large and slow for its battle rating, it accumulates a lot more damage due to the slow speed, this unfortunately makes it a very easy vessel to hit and critically damage.

{{main|Type 97 (57 mm)}}
[[File:Ha-Go Fighting Boat Model 1 (2).jpg|thumb|528x528px|The Ha-Go Fighting Boat Model 1]]
This boat is equipped with the 57 mm Type 97 cannon, which is functionally very similar to that found on the I-Go Ko and Chi-Ha tanks, though it has some slight ballistic differences. For the Ha-Go though it's a fairly underwhelming weapon for a primary. It will do significant damage to smaller boats when the shot lands but landing a shot is the hardest part. It comes with three different rounds:

* HE - Decent damage output over a fairly wide area
* HEAT - Higher damage output over a condensed area, with lower velocity
* APHE - Very little damage potential due to low explosive mass

Overall the stock HE round is the most consistent to use at range, dealing a fair amount damage, blacking out compartments on smaller boats with a single hit. The HEAT contains more explosive filler, and is optimal against more armoured targets, but it doesn't spread its damage like the HE shell does. Due to its lower muzzle velocity, it can be difficult to aim, but a few shells will knock out any small ships you face. The APHE is close to useless functionally, it contains less than half the explosive filler compared to the HE and does a very little amount of internal damage, use HEAT instead if you are facing armoured targets.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 98 (20 mm)}}

The Ha-Go is equipped with twin 20 mm Type 98 cannons for its secondary weapon. These cannons perform very well against aircraft and boats alike, however they can't fire directly forwards, as the cabin blocks the line of sight. All in all, its a modestly powerful weapon and more reliable than the primary 57 mm gun. The magazine for each cannon contains 20 rounds and reloads very quickly, allowing for a steady stream of fire against enemy vessels or aircraft. It comes with three belts:

* Universal - A mix of high explosive and armour piercing rounds.
* HET - Majority high explosive rounds
* APT - Majority armour piercing rounds

While HET rounds remain more viable over longer ranges, and against aircraft, APT rounds contain much higher killing potential at close range (<u><</u>1km) due to their ability to quickly destroy compartments. This is especially important as the Ha-Go is very vulnerable to close range machine gun fire and autocannon fire in general  due to its exposed crew compartment, and will quickly lose out in longer engagements. Bring both APT and HET belts, swapping between the two for maximum efficiency.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 3 depth charge}}

The Ha-Go can carry eight Type 95 depth charges, which can be dropped to maim other naval targets, they have rather limited viability though as most MTBs will be able to outrun the explosion. However they are useful in the event of being rushed by a smaller naval vessel, as if the drop is timed right the depth charges can easily take out enemies performing this manoeuvre.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
[[File:Ha-Go Fighting Boat Model 1 (1).jpg|thumb|606x606px|Ha-Go Fighting Boat engaging an enemy LS class vessel]]
A very important aspect of staying afloat in the Ha-Go is to not actively make yourself a target, if this boat is caught out in the open it will be very easy for enemy vessels to hit, as it's so slow and unarmoured, a single high calibre cannon round will break the hull, and autocannon fire will steadily chew through the hull and crew members. Open water is a very dangerous place to be in this vessel, it works best around the terrain where it can use the environmental cover. It's a good idea to hug the various terrain on most maps, be it islands or shipwrecks, this way the vessel has some form of constant cover.

It's recommended to play defensively with this boat, due to your slow speed and relative fragility. The twin 20 mm cannons still make for a decent versatile weapon, and can be lethal at close ranges. To maintain cover, it's possible to stick the rear of the vessel out of cover so only the rear compartment and the twin cannons are visible, this way the majority of the vessel is protected from taking fire, and the most effective weapon has a wide area it can cover, and if a dangerous enemy boat appears or you're taking too much fire, you can simply accelerate off out of sight. This vessel has no active defensive qualities, so to make it work effectively, you'll need to negate the negatives of its lack of armour and lack of mobility, staying somewhat sedentary around hard cover from the terrain is one of the most effective ways to do this.

The main 57 mm cannon will do substantial damage to smaller craft if the round connects, but it has very low velocity and is close to unusable in rough seas, on more placid water it can be used somewhat effectively, but most of the time the secondary 20 mm guns will be more effective, and can also tackle enemy aircraft fairly well. The time it takes to range in the 57 mm cannon, isn't really worth its potential damage output, the twin 20 mm guns will deal a constant stream of damage, and are much easier to aim accurately over distance, or for hitting weak spots.

Ha-Go Fighting Boat Model 1 (波號戦斗艇一型), also known Se-Ha (せは艇) was one of the first prototypes of small escort boats (小護衛艇) by the Imperial Japanese Army. It was designed to escort "Daihatsu"-class landing crafts that were transporting munitions to offshore islands.

In January 1944, the Imperial Japanese Army 10th Technical Research Institute ordered Hitachi Zosen Sakurajima shipyard to make two types of small escort craft. The first, called Ha-Go Fighting Boat Model 1 "Se-Ha" (Ha-Go meaning "Mark A"), was to be equipped with two 150 hp engines, and a second named the Ha-Go Fighting Boat Model 2 "Se-Ni" equipped with two 60 hp engines.

The Se-Ni was completed in October 1944 but the top speed was only 9 knots so the plan was cancelled. Se-Ha was eventually completed in December 1944, but after trials the engineers decided to try to modify the design to get more speed.

A third design, "Se-Ha Kai" was completed in July 1945. In a trial cruise during October 2-5, its speed reached 13 knots so research ended. By the surrender of Japan, it had not been formally adopted, but would have been officially named the Type 5 Small Escort Boat. ("Type 5" already in game is Large Escort Boat.)
