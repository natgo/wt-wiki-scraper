== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''Hugin class''' was a set of small patrol boats designed for the post-war German Navy by a Norwegian designer. The two boats were ordered for evaluation since Germany decided to test a new hull shape different from their previous fast attack vessels, specifically designed to operate in narrow coastal waters. The two vessels were ordered in 1960 from the Norwegian company Båtservice Verft, of Mandal, that had already a decent experience with these sorts of designs. The experiment, however, failed and in 1964 the vessels were transferred to the Turkish Navy.

It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' works very well in most conditions at its BR, but it suffers from lack of armour, a mediocre armament and the fact that is very small. It will usually fight early destroyers and gun boats with far more powerful armament. However the Hugin is very fast, and has very capable mobility. The 40 mm Bofors L/70 model 1948 cannon has access to pretty capable ammo belts, a decently large ammo pool and enough penetration to deal with other torpedo boats and even heavier gun boats armed with more conventional cannons. Is a good idea sneaking through the coast and attacking unsuspected destroyers or frigates using your torpedoes, while using your good mobility to rush capture points at the start of the match.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
As expected for a vessel of its BR and class, the Hugin has rather poor survivability. Like most torpedo boats, the Hugin has a very exposed main armament and the ammo magazines are also very exposed to even 12.7 mm fire. Even small high explosive projectiles can set the boat afire and disable it or even destroy it by killing most of the crew in case of a direct hit to the crew compartment.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Like most small vessels, the ''Hugin'' has a good top speed and acceleration, being able to reach capture points with ease. This mobility is best used to ambush stronger enemies or to rotate positions quickly.

The most important upgrades for this vessel are the "Smokescreen", "Torpedo Mode", and "Artillery Support".

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/70 model 1948 (40 mm)}}

The Hugin's main armament consists of two 40 mm L/70 m1948 Bofors cannons, which offer good firepower against light targets, but they are not so good against heavier opponents or small aircraft due to their low rate of fire.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|G7a (533 mm)}}

For dealing with strong foes, the Hugin has access to four 533 mm torpedoes. These are fixed to the hull and are thus quite hard to aim; as such, use the superior mobility of the Hugin to point your front to the enemy ship and quickly retreat to cover behind islands or other ships after launching.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Hugin is best used as a support vessel, its superior speed and mobility gives it the ability to quickly reach capture points. Considering its primary armament, it has enough firepower to defend itself against lighter vessels that may only have .50 cal MGs or small autocannons. However, the Hugin should stay on the move to avoid being targeted by destroyers and heavier vessels with powerful cannons.

To deal with these enemies, use the terrain to your advantage, closing distances with your target when they enter the areas of the map with hills and islands around them. As you close distance, try to quickly appear behind or beside your target, launch your torpedoes and retreat to cover.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Adequate top speed and agility
* Good primary armament against light vessels
* Access to torpedoes to deal with heavier vessels such as destroyers

'''Cons:'''

* Poor survivability
* No secondary armament to deal with enemy aircraft
* Fixed torpedoes limit launch opportunities

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

During German rearmament in the Cold War era, the West German Navy, the ''Bundesmarine'', had built a number of fast attack vessels mostly based on previous designs of World War 2. However since the Cold War era introduced much superior technology, these vessels were very outmatched by Soviet and East German designs.

Thus, in the 1960s, the German Navy was interested in the adoption of a new concept for a completely different shape for vessels made for narrow coastal waters. A Norwegian company by the name ''Båtservice Verft'' was interested in providing Germany with these designs. This company already had experience in designing small motor boats and they provided Germany with a prototype fast patrol boat called the ''Nasty'', designed with a hard-chined planing hull.

Germany acquired only two boats, named Hugin and Munnin after Odin's ravens in Norse mythology. The two vessels remained in service for almost four years, but the experiment was not successful and they were transferred to the Turkish Navy in 1964.
