== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (阿賀野, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Agano River) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Agano is very fast for a cruiser and can keep up with some destroyers when fully upgraded.The ship makes up for its overall semi-weak armour with speed. It is able to weave in and out of combat at will and is relatively manoeuvrable when compared to its usual adversaries.

If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.''

=== Additional armament ===

''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.''

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships is a catapult with one Aichi E13A1 scout plane (the second stored on the trolley is not available) which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The E13A1 is equipped with a [[Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm Type 97]] defensive machine gun and a formidable load of 4 x 60 kg bombs. It also has the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilize the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new! Carrying a heavier bomb load than most other scout planes, this unit has a very good chance to sink enemy boats or even a destroyer.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 16 Long Lance torpedoes are devastating against enemy ships
* Very fast for a cruiser, can keep up with some destroyers when fully upgraded
* Main guns have a great rate of fire in first-stage, equal to US cruisers
* One scout plane

'''Cons:'''

* 25 mm AA guns cannot engage close targets
* Torpedoes have very limited firing arc
* Armour is mediocre, other cruisers will punch right through it at close range
* Turrets are large and lack armour, can thus easily be disabled
* Main gun shells are very weak

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Agano was the lead ship of four light cruisers built to supercede and replace the older cruisers serving as destroyer flotilla flagships in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Launched in October 1941, she entered service a year later and saw her first operation escorting troop transports to New Guinea in December 1942. The ship was involved in Operation Ke, the evacuation of 10,652 Japanese troops from Guadalcanal as well as the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, an American victory which closed the Solomon Islands campaign. Several weeks later, American airstrikes damaged the ship as it lay in port at Rabaul and whilst en route to receive repairs, she was struck by a torpedo from an American submarine which flooded the boiler rooms and knocked out all power. The submarine Albacore prepared to finish the helpless and immobile ship, but was prevented from doing so by depth charges from the Urakaze. Taken under tow to Truk, Agano underwent 4 months of repairs before being able to attempt the journey back to the home islands of Japan in February 1944, for more permanent fixes. Ambushed by the American submarine Skate, Agano was hit by 2 torpedoes and sank 6 hours later.

Her destroyer escort Oite took on 523 survivors from the Agano, but was herself sunk 2 days later by Grumman TBF Avengers of Task Force 58 during Operation Hailstone. She sank almost immediately with the loss 172 out of her 192 complement whilst all 523 survivors of the Agano were lost.
