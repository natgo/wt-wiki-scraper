'''Agano''' (Japanese: 阿賀野) was the lead ship of her class of Imperial Japanese Navy light cruisers (in Japanese also designated as 阿賀野型軽巡洋艦 - second-rank cruisers of the Agano class). Launched and commissioned in October 1940, she saw limited combat during her service. Although designed as a modern vessel, she was criticised for her inadequate anti-aircraft armament. Agano participated in several missions, including the Battle of Bougainville Island, but her role was marginal at best. In November 1943, she was heavily damaged during the Rabaul air raids, losing her rudder and two propellers. While attempting to return to Japan for repairs, she was torpedoed by the American submarine USS Skate on 16 February 1944 and subsequently sank, marking the first loss of her class.

'''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced along with the initial release of the Imperial Japanese Navy in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]]. She has a fairly high speed, long-lance torpedoes, scout planes, and a good rate of fire, making it easy to fight against destroyers and other cruisers, while also being very competent at winning missions through objectives. Her biggest downsides are very limited anti-air capability, relatively poor survivability, and low penetration of the armour-piercing rounds, making her a difficult vessel to play in uptiers.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Armour is virtually non-existent. A few accurate salvos from an american. soviet or even german destroyer will send IJN Agano to the bottom of the sea.'' 

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Agano is very fast for a cruiser and can keep up with some destroyers when fully upgraded.The ship makes up for its overall semi-weak armour with speed. It is able to weave in and out of combat at will and is relatively manoeuvrable when compared to its usual adversaries.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
{{main|25 mm/60 Type 96 (25 mm)}}

''Anti-aircraft defenses can be described as adequate at best. 10 x 25 mm AA guns in four separate mounts can shoot down a slow-flying or non-maneuvering plane at distances of under 2 km. However, they will have trouble dealing with a fast and maneuvering aircraft.''

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
{{main|Type 93 Model 1, Mod 2 (610 mm)}}

''The ship has 16 type 93, mod 2 torpedos in 2 torpedo tubes with the impressive explosive mass of almost 500 kg (627 kg of TNT equivalent), and the travel distance of 20 km at the speed of 91 km\h. They are capable of dealing a fatal blow to most opponents including battleships, provided that the hit lands anywhere near their ammo.Note that the firing angles of the tubes are very limited.'' 

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships is a catapult with one Aichi E13A1 scout plane (the second stored on the trolley is not available) which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The E13A1 is equipped with a [[Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm Type 97]] defensive machine gun and a formidable load of 4 x 60 kg bombs. It also has the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilize the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new! Carrying a heavier bomb load than most other scout planes, this unit has a very good chance to sink enemy boats or even a destroyer.

== Usage in battles ==
''When downtiered your best bet is to go after enemy destroyers as your fast-firing (6 second reload) 6inch guns provide you with excellent means of disposing of them. One has, however, to be accurate with their shots, as the ready rack only has 20 shells per gun, and when that is gone you are left in a very precarious position. It is best to find a safe spot and have it reloaded. Try to avoid duels with enemy cruisers as your guns can hardly penetrate most of them.  When uptiered you can face WWI battlecruisers, heavily armoured cruisers which your guns can only scratch. Your only realistic way of fighting them is to use your torpedos.''  

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 16 Long Lance torpedoes are devastating against enemy ships
* Very fast for a cruiser, can keep up with some destroyers when fully upgraded
* Main guns have a great rate of fire in first-stage, equal to US cruisers
* One scout plane

'''Cons:'''

* 25 mm AA guns cannot engage close targets
* Torpedoes have very limited firing arc
* Armour is mediocre, other cruisers will punch right through it at close range
* Turrets are large and lack armour, can thus easily be disabled
* Main gun shells lack penetration power

Agano was the lead ship of four light cruisers built to supercede and replace the older cruisers serving as destroyer flotilla flagships in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Launched in October 1941, she entered service a year later and saw her first operation escorting troop transports to New Guinea in December 1942. The ship was involved in Operation Ke, the evacuation of 10,652 Japanese troops from Guadalcanal as well as the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, an American victory which closed the Solomon Islands campaign. Several weeks later, American airstrikes damaged the ship as it lay in port at Rabaul and whilst en route to receive repairs, she was struck by a torpedo from an American submarine which flooded the boiler rooms and knocked out all power. The submarine Albacore prepared to finish the helpless and immobile ship, but was prevented from doing so by depth charges from the Urakaze. Taken under tow to Truk, Agano underwent 4 months of repairs before being able to attempt the journey back to the home islands of Japan in February 1944, for more permanent fixes. Ambushed by the American submarine Skate, Agano was hit by 2 torpedoes and sank 6 hours later.

Her destroyer escort Oite took on 523 survivors from the Agano, but was herself sunk 2 days later by Grumman TBF Avengers of Task Force 58 during Operation Hailstone. She sank almost immediately with the loss 172 out of her 192 complement whilst all 523 survivors of the Agano were lost.
