== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (綾波, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Twilled Waves) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

Overall a generally capable and well-rounded destroyer, it trades the secondary/anti-aircraft armament of most other destroyers for a powerful and long-range torpedo armament, meaning it is exceptionally vulnerable to aircraft.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

Overall {{PAGENAME}} has average survivability and armour for its battle rating.

She has a {{#unit:jp_destroyer_fubuki|броня|корпус|толщина}} mm of {{#unit:jp_destroyer_fubuki|броня|корпус|материал}} armour on her hull, {{#unit:jp_destroyer_fubuki|броня|надстройка|толщина}} mm on her superstructure, and {{#unit:jp_destroyer_fubuki|броня|башня|лоб}} mm over her main firing tower, which is average for a destroyer in the same BR. Her guns carry 3.175 mm of anti-fragmentation armour that, unlike in the equivalents, provides protection from all directions. Her {{#unit:jp_destroyer_fubuki|crew}} crew count is also average.

Looking at the weak points of her layout, the primary gun turrets are very large and relatively easy to knock out, while hits amidship are very likely to knock out at least one torpedo mount and one of the engines. On the other hand bulk of the ammunition is stored underwater, making it a difficult ship to ammo-rack.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility
|SpeedForwardStockAB = 57
|SpeedBackStockAB = 21
|TurnTimeStockAB = 116.767
|TurnSpeedStockAB = 40
}}

50,000 IHP coming out of four Kampon boilers and two Kampon 'Ro' geared turbines give her a max speed of ~65 km/h, which is fairly middle of the road for comparable destroyers. She has a 5.4s rudder shift which is his is decent enough mobility, but won't win any prizes compared to other destroyers. When taking evasive action, the ship's turn rate is faster than the turret's targeting rate, requiring more steady course to re-adjust firing solution.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Top two research priorities should be Tool Set and Fire Protection System. Beyond that its primarily sprint towards Torpedo Mode. Rudder Replacement is generally a must-have for arcade, due to the amount of torpedoes dropped during the battle, while in Realistic mode Propeller Replacement would be a higher priority. Beyond that Ventilation and Shrapnel Protection are always a good add-ons for destroyers. Least important modification in the tree is the Bomb mortar.

[[File:Ayanami primaries.jpg|thumb|right|Ayanami's broadside with the HE shells captured]]
{{main|127 mm/50 3rd Year Type (127 mm)}}

The Type 3 127 mm gun found on the Ayanami is mounted on a particular three, twin mount turrets that were historically called a "Model B" or "Type B" (B型砲を, B-gata-hō). They are located in a rear-heavy configuration, bearing one turret in the front and two rear turrets in a super-firing configuration. Guns have two types of shells available: HE and HE-DF. The shell speed of 910 m/s is the second-best among comparable destroyers, exceeded only by a modern [[Albatros-Klasse (143)]], firing shells at 914 to 925 m/s (depending on the type). She has a 7.5s (8 rounds/min) reload speed with a stock crew and a 5.5s (11 rounds/min) reload speed with a fully aced crew, which is one of the lowest rates of fire, compensating it with a large number of shells fired in a broadside.

The HE shell has 54 mm (0° angle) of penetration at 1,000 m, dropping off to 27 mm at all angles at 10,000 m. It carries 2.2 kg of a Type 91 explosive filler (military name for the Trinitroanisole) that has an equivalent power of 2.31 kg of TNT. It's a significant upgrade from Mutsuki's 1.95 kg TNT equivalent 120 mm HE shell, but relatively low comparing to 3.22 kg TNT equivalent onboard [[Farragut (DD-355)|Farragut's]] [[5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)|5 inch]].

The HE-DF is delayed fuse ammunition, should be used only to engage enemy aircraft at a distance, supplementing relatively weak secondary armament. While hitting a small target is certainly a difficult challenge, it's much easier than on the predeceasing Mutsuki due to notably higher shell travel speed significantly better vertical guidance (+75° vs +33° on Mutsuki) and a higher targeting speed (5.1°/s horizontal and a whopping 23°/s vertical).

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 93 (13.2 mm)}}

The secondary weaponry on the Ayanami consists of two twin 13.2 mm Type 93 machine guns located amidship, on a platform attached to the rear smoke funnel. Practically speaking they are applicable primarily for anti-aircraft role, similarly to the machine guns on the [[IJN Mutsuki|Mutsuki]], but they have notably higher firepower, even if overall they are the weakest secondaries among Ayanami's BR.

Firing 476 RPM with a magazine of 120 rounds of ammunition and a reload speed of two seconds gives them a decent uptime. These Type 93 machine guns can use Universal (T/AP/HEI/AP), HEI or AP belts of ammunition. The AP belts have 26 mm of penetration at 10 m, dropping off to 12 mm at 1,000 m; while the tracer round in the HEI belt has 10 mm of penetration at 10 m, dropping off to 6 mm at 1,000 m. Their traverse is very good, covering up to +80°, however overall these are just two dual machine guns of a relatively low calibre, which is the weakest secondary armament.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
[[File:Ayanami-torpedo-firing-arcs.jpg|thumb|right|Graphic detailing port firing arcs for each of the launchers, with a total firing arc of 90° and an overlapping arc of 40°]]
{{main|Type 90 (610 mm)|Type 95 depth charge}}

The Fubuki-class has three triple torpedo mounts of a 610 mm calibre. They can carry an onboard reload so total amount of torpedoes are 18. Spare torpedo storage are placed on side of funnel and 2nd turret.  These torpedoes are the Type 90, which have good speed - 85 km/h or 52 mph - and 7 or 15 km range respectively (Torpedo Mode modification off/on). The Type 90 carries 480 kg of TNT equivalent explosives, which is only beaten out by the [[Type 93 (Disambiguation)#Torpedoes|Type 93s]] found, between others, in subsequent [[IJN Yugumo|Yugumo]]. Overall, they are strong torpedoes for their 4.0 BR, given their good range, fast speed and large explosive filler. Torpedo Mode modification is a tier IV, making it a time-taking unlock.

Unlike on the [[IJN Mutsuki]], launchers on the Ayanami have a much more intuitive setup, with the first, front launcher covering the widest firing arc (80°), but also being the first one to fire when manoeuvring bow-first towards the enemy. Second, middle launcher having relatively decent 66° firing arc and oriented towards rear of the ship is also fairly usable. The tricky one is the third launcher, aiming exactly perpendicular to the ship, and having a very narrow field of fire. It plays more of a support role, forcing the ship to expose its entire length to the enemy. Overall though, it's a very practical setup, making Fubuki-class an extremely dangerous enemy, able to release torpedoes without you knowing it, or cover an entire strait with a wall of torpedoes.

The Ayanami can mount eight Type 95 depth charges, located near the rear of the vessel. They have a 100 kg TNT equivalent filler but are less effective at this point without submarines in the game at this time.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Fubuki-class is a good long-range combatant. Fast shell travel speed of her guns enables effective engagement at ranges where enemies would struggle with a response, which is further aided by a relatively fast and long-range torpedoes (that can trade speed for a significant increase in range with the Torpedo Mode modification).

The ship can also be effectively used as a kiter, owning it to a rear-heavy primary armament and an ability to deploy a significant number of a powerful, long-range torpedoes. However, an average speed for the BR makes it far more challenging to choose the engagements when compared to faster Mutsuki.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Exceptionally high shell speed
* Effective torpedoes for its battle rating
* Torpedoes have exceptional range, allowing it to potentially "snipe" enemy ships outside of their gun range
* Large torpedo armament, with 9 tubes and 18 torpedoes

'''Cons:'''

* Inadequate secondary armament
* Poses very little threat to the aircraft
* Outgunned within the range of secondaries by any other destroyer in the same BR
* Lack of AP shells means it cannot effectively damage ship interiors or fight armoured ships

The Special-Type Destroyers represented in-game with IJN Ayanami were designed in 1922 due to the Washington Naval Treaty. Under the criteria of a speed of 39 knots (72 km/h), a 4,000 nautical mile range and a strong torpedo armament, the class were ordered in 1923. Their armament and size were very good for their time and remained a fair enemy up to the end of WW II. They were designed to 'cruise' in the Pacific, as the bow was shaped to provide protection against the weather. Built between June 1928 and March 1933, they fall into three main groups: The Fubuki class, using the Type 3 'A' mount, the Ayanami class, using the Type 3 'B' mount and with other changes, and the Akatsuki class, which had three boilers and a torpedo launcher/turret. However, their heavyweight caused stability issues and after the Fourth Fleet Incident, they were rebuilt in 1935-1937 with more ballast, a slightly different bridge, and less gun and torpedo ammunition. Eight Ayanamis also were retrofitted with Type 3 'C' guns. These rebuilds increased their weight further to 2,000 tons, and over 2,400 with a full load. IJN Ayanami was sunk in November 1942, when the battleship USS Washington shelled her and caused heavy damage resulting in its scuttling by fellow Ayanami-class ship, Uranami.
