== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (初春, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Early Spring) was the lead ship of her class, the first Japanese destroyer designed after the signing of the London Naval Treaty. Due to the displacement restrictions of the treaty, additional vessels of the most recent Fubuki-class destroyers were not allowed to be constructed, so a new design was proposed for future generations of destroyers. However, this didn't deter the Japanese naval design bureau from fitting the same amount of armament on a slightly shorter hull with one less gun, thereby pushing the capabilities of the hull. This resulted in a very top-heavy design, which only came in serious question following the "Tomozuru Incident" of 1934 and the "4th Fleet Incident" of 1935.

She was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]]. Hatsuharu appears in her planned pre-refit configuration, featuring a densely packed and top-heavy structure that makes any hit likely to damage at least one or two critical components. Three 127 mm cannons are mounted on the bow of the ship, providing a higher amount of firepower in a head-on engagement compared to other Japanese destroyers. Additionally, the ship has three triple-mount torpedo launchers squeezed into the center, allowing for the ability to fire 9 torpedoes simultaneously. Though these torpedoes can be reloaded at sea, it poses a risk of an explosive ammo rack if the ship is hit.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The Hatsuharu has a relatively low crew count of only 212 sailors. But most of the important parts are safer because they are located below the waterline. the most endangered place is the ammo elevator because in case of a fire it can detonate the ammo. the main armament is defended with the 3.175 antifragmentation armor so shrapnel probably won´t knock it out but a direct hit will destroy it.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

Probably due to the low displacement, the ship is quite manouverable. The ship has decent acceleration and good top speed, it also has quite good stopping power.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|127 mm/50 3rd Year Type (127 mm)}}

The ships primary weapons are two double-barreled 127mm cannons and one single-barrel 127mm cannon. The first stage reload speed is 6 second and the normal reload speed is 6.6 seconds. The player has the option to choose from two shell types HE with penetration of 28mm of armor and HE-TF with penetration of 26mm with the capacity of  750 shells.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|40 mm/62 Vickers (40 mm)}}

The ship is fitted with two 40 mm autocannons which are positioned as anti-aircraft guns but are considered auxiliary weapons. They have a fire rate of 200 shots per minute and ammo capacity of 50 rounds. the cannons can be fitted with three ammunition the HE clips which are best used as anti-aircraft, the AP clips which can be used to destroy smaller ships or boats, and the HE-TF clips which are good for anti-aircraft fire.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 90 (610 mm)|Type 95 depth charge}}

The ship can be fitted with torpedoes and a bomb mortar. The torpedoes are very effective at closer ranges, and because the torpedo tubes can each hold 4 torpedoes (there are two torpedo tubes located at the center of the ship) the player has more chances to hit the target. Also, the torpedoes are quite fast (max speed 91km per hour) and have a heavy explosive mass of 375 kg which is the equivalent of 480 kg of TNT. The bomb mortars have very limited use right now because of absence of submarines and can only hit ships at about 500 meters.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
