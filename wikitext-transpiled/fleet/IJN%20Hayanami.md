== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (早波, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Early Waves) is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Winged Lions"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7469-event-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2021 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R.]] event.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Just like its sister-ship [[IJN Yugumo|Yugumo]], Hayanami upgrades over [[IJN Ayanami]] in survivability, primarily due to its lower profile, but also higher crew count. Notably, the Yugumo-class has a much lower freeboard, lower forecastle, and much smaller smoke funnels. This in effect gives it a better chance of avoiding enemy fire, especially at the long range, even though overall it is a longer ship. Additionally, its survivability is further aided by having ammunition stored deep underneath the water line, and having torpedo turrets protected against fragmentation damage, though they are still one of the easiest components to damage on the ship.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

Hayanami comes spaded as a premium and has a max speed of 79 km/h. Overall its relatively comparable with equivalents in other nations, if not slightly slower, though the differences are within 5% range between most of the destroyers in the same BR. The maximum reverse speed is -31 km/h spaded.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
[[File:Yugumo Main guns.jpg|thumb|right|[[Type 3 (127 mm)|Primary guns]] firing with other weapon systems clearly visible on the hull]]
{{main|127 mm/50 3rd Year Type (127 mm)}}

Like all regular Japanese destroyers, the Hayanami has 3 turrets boasting dual Type 3 127 mm cannons, offering the same capabilities and the same shell choice as the [[IJN Yugumo]]. Though as Hayanami sees the same risks in BR, her captain will have to rely on very accurate gunnery and torpedo laying abilities to keep the ship afloat.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|25 mm/60 Type 96 (25 mm)}}

The Hayanami is equipped with three twin mountings of the 25 mm Type 96 autocannon, 1 more than her sister Yugumo. Its setup clearly plays a primary role as an anti-aircraft weaponry, having turrets located to provide optimal AA coverage, however they are classified as an auxiliary armament and will use those crew skills instead of anti-aircraft. The high-explosive type rounds this gun fires will have no trouble knocking out any airplane it hits. AP type rounds are also available and can be used against small torpedo boats that want to sneak. Each twin mounting is placed on side of the ship which mean they can't shoot at the same target unless its aircraft.

* Universal belts: good balance between firepower and tracer contents, useful for newcomers to the Japanese 25 mm autocannon.
* APT belts: Full of AP shells, good against boats but you might not meet lots of them in destroyer.
* HEI belts: Trades tracer rounds for extra firepower, harder to aim but very good at knocking out aircraft.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 93 Model 1, Mod 2 (610 mm)|Type 95 depth charge}}

Like her sisters, Hayanami uses the very potent Type 93 Model 1, Mod 2 torpedoes. Those are the second most powerful torpedoes in-game just after the Type 93 Model 3 variant, which enables it to sink nearly any destroyer with a single hit. To compare with equivalents of other nations, Hayanami's torpedoes have an equivalent of 627.2 kg TNT, while German [[G7a (533 mm)|G7a]] has 358.4 kg, British [[Mk.IX (533 mm)|Mk.IX]] has 340 kg, and US [[Mk.15 (533 mm)|Mk.15]] has 224 kg, all also having much lower range and slower speed. It's one of the best torpedoes available, bested only by [[Type 93 Model 3 (610 mm)|Type 93 Model 3]] or more modern anti-ship torpedoes, such as [[Mk.16 (533 mm)|Mk.16]].

[[File:Yugumo Depth Charges Distance.jpg|thumb|right|Explosion size and distance of the depth charges released from Yugumo with a minimal fuze time]]

Hayanami also has the ability to equip 8 Type 95 depth charges. All are stored above deck and ejected pneumatically to either port or starboard, up to four on each side.

Depth charges currently have an extremely limited use, having no submarines in the game and being limited to a combination of a static position where they were dropped at, and a specific time at which enemy has to arrive in order to risk any damage from the charge.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Like all torpedo-centric destroyers Hayanami excels in Arcade Battles with the ability to restock torpedoes mid-battle, but has a much tougher time in Realistic Battles. With her mediocre survivability and lack of AP shells, it's always best to sit back and make use of the 20 km range the torpedoes offer. While playing Arcade, it's best to keep distance and use the cannons as a secondary, whereas in RB torpedoes should be prioritized for heavier and deadlier targets such as cruisers and not instantly thrown in the water, closing the gap towards a capture point to capture and rearm while defending off against other ships with the main cannons.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Can release 8 torpedoes at once
** With an additional 8 torpedoes that have to be reloaded afterwards
* One of the best torpedoes (Long Lance)
* Good mobility
* Small profile

'''Cons:'''

* No access to armour-piercing shells
* Weak anti-aircraft armament, especially against higher altitude bombers
* Torpedo tubes are damaged easily
* Low crew count

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
{{Main|Yugumo_(Family)#History|l1=History of the Yūgumo-class}}

The Japanese Yugumo-class destroyer Hayanami was completed in December 1942 at the Maizuru shipyard, and entered service in the summer of 1943. In the autumn of the same year, she escorted transports and landing ships on routes from the Japanese metropolis to the Micronesian islands and to the Solomon Islands. On June 7, 1944, the destroyer was torpedoed by the American submarine USS Harder near the Tawi-Tawi Islands, an explosion occurred on the ship and the destroyer sank. The 45 survivors were saved by the destroyer Urakaze.
