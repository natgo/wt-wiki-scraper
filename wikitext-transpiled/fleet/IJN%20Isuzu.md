== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (五十鈴, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Isuzu River) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

The IJN Isuzu is in her 1944 refit, with the sole purpose of acting as a floating anti-aircraft platform in an attempt to counter the United States' air superiority and slow down their advance. To achieve this, her 140 mm guns were replaced with a 127 mm anti-air cannons, as well as a staggering 50 x 25 mm Type 96 anti-air cannons. Giving her an unparalleled anti-air capabilities for her rank in exchange of anti-ship firepower.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Even when compared to the infamous Omaha-class cruisers such as the [[USS Trenton]], the IJN Isuzu's protection is easily one of the worst among the range of cruisers in the game. Most of the Isuzu armour were concentrated around the engines, which were a double-layered RHA with 38 mm thickness for the outer layer and 25 mm for the inner layer. This armour can shield off the blast of HE shells, but will not protect her engines from SAP or AP shells.

As her crew compartments is mostly located on the first deck without protection, and as she has a large number of AA mounts, the Isuzu will lose a considerable amount of her crew with a few HE salvos. The ship's low crew count of 510 sailors will not help her to withstand enemy fire for long.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
With her low displacement, the IJN Isuzu is very fast and agile for a light cruiser. This will be important for the Isuzu's survival as you have to manoeuvre a lot to evade incoming fire.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|5 inch/40 Type 89 (127 mm)}}
Isuzu's main armament consists of 6 x 5 inch (12.7 cm) cannons mounted in 3 turrets. They have no protection so they can be easily knocked out. There are 2 types of shells avaible: HE and HE-TF (time-fused). While HE shells aren't as effective against ships as the previous ship's ([[IJN Akizuki]]), time fuse shells can easily destroy enemy planes, especially when they are diving. In combination with the secondary armament, this ship excels in anti-aircraft fire. Fire rate isn't quick, but it is enough to aim a few shells at air targets.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|25 mm/60 Type 96 (25 mm)}}
As an anti-air cruiser, the Isuzu is equipped with 50 x 25 mm Type 96 AA cannons placed all over the ship, a large amount of AA guns of a Japanese ship (only behind the [[IJN Tone|Tone]] with 62 AA guns). The sheer amount of the guns give the Isuzu a massive burst output that will deter any aerial threats from getting close.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 93 Model 1, Mod 2 (610 mm)}}
The only capable anti-ship weaponry the Isuzu have at her disposal is eight Type 93 Model 1 "Long Lance" torpedoes launched from quadruple launchers on each side of the ship. As the previous ship in the line, the [[IJN Yugumo|Yugumo]], demonstrated its potential, these fast and deadly torpedoes need no further introduction. Although the Isuzu carries only half of the "Long Lance" of the Yugumo and is therefore less effective at long-range anti-ship duties.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Due to her disproportional main and secondary/anti-air armament, the Isuzu is essentially an oversized destroyer in term of playstyle. The Isuzu's six 127 mm guns are reasonably effective against most destroyer she will usually face, but is inadequate against anything larger than that. Thus, the Isuzu perform best as an escort ship, providing supplementary and anti-air support for friendly ship, while the Long Lance torpedoes can help the Isuzu to sink some enemy ships.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* 127 mm guns have good rate of fire and good traverse speed
* 50 x 25 mm AA guns gives the Isuzu one of the best AA defence capability in the Japanese fleet
* Very good top speed and mobility
* Equipped with deadly Type 93 torpedoes

'''Cons:'''
* Extremely poor protection
* Engines and transmission can be easily damaged
* 127 mm guns lack stopping power against enemy cruisers
* Will be always outgunned by every cruiser and even some destroyers
* Open turrets with lack of gun shield, can be easily disabled
