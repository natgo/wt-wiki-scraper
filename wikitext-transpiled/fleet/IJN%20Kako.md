== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (加古, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Kako River) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese heavy cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

Designed to meet the 10,000-ton displacement restrictions of the Washington naval treaty, the early refit Kako features several unique quirks for a heavy cruiser. To reduce the weight of the ship, the Kako features only few secondary and AA mounts. While this made her particularly vulnerable against aerial threats, the result is that the Kako has only 8,640 tons of displacement - comparable to most of the post-treaty light cruisers - while having greater protection compared to ships of a similar or higher displacement, as well as similar good mobility.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
For a heavy cruiser, the Kako's protection is average. The main citadel is covered with 76.2 mm of RHA and citadel deck armour varies between 31.75 to 34.9 mm. The armour can withstand a fair amount of beatings from mid-to-long ranges (6 km or more), thought became much more vulnerable when not angled.

While the Kako features a low crew count of 616 men, she is able to maintain most of her crew due to the lack of secondary and AA mounts, which means she will only lose sailors when the crew compartment is damaged.

Along with her sister ship [[IJN Furutaka|Furutaka]], the Kako has the unique perk of being able to withstand fire damage with little to no crew loss due to her crew compartments is located further away from the deck and are spaced from each other. This ability makes the Kako much more bearable for new captains who don't have FPE, and allows experienced captains to focus on repairing the more serious damage on the ship.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- 'Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Due to her low displacement, the Kako features good mobility that is comparable to a light cruisers. She can accelerate and decelerate faster compared to other heavy cruisers and turns quite well when upgraded.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|20 cm 3rd year type No.1 (200 mm)}}

The Kako features six 200 mm 3rd year type No.1 cannons mounted in six single turrets arranged in an unusual A-Bs-C-X-Ys-Z setup. While the turret itself had sluggish traverse speed, this peculiar turret setup allows the A-B and X-Y turrets to rotate freely without having to turn around when the ship is changing directions, as well as provides wide gun coverage when angled.

The 200 mm guns are extremely powerful for the Kako's battle rating, as they can deal a serious damage against more advanced cruisers when aimed properly and are devastating against destroyers that she will usually face. The main guns have access to two type of shells; an HEF shell with 8 kg of TNT equivalent, which is very powerful against destroyers and deals consistent damage against cruisers, and an APC shell with 219 mm of
penetration at 10 km with decent 3 kg of explosive filler, this shell is able to penetrate any opponent and deal serious internal damage, as well as  penetrate dreadnoughts at close range.

On the other hand, the 200 mm guns have a slow reload time of 15 seconds (ace crew), and a whooping 22 seconds when all the ammunition in the ready rack has been used. The guns also have a rather poor accuracy as the shells will occasionally scatter around the target.

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|120 mm/45 10th year type (120 mm)}}

The secondary armament of the Kako is four 120 mm 10th year type cannons, placed in pairs on the port and starboard side of the superstructure. The guns have a short reload time of 4 seconds and a relatively good accuracy. This, however, is your only line of defense against aircraft, as your anti-air armament is just four machine guns. The guns are loaded with HEF shells by default with an option to use HE-TF shell for anti-air defence.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
[[File:Type 93 13.2mm on Kako.jpg|thumb|right|Type 93 machine guns are located on both sides of the Kako's main superstructure]]
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 93 (13.2 mm)}}

The Kako has only four 13.2 mm Type 93 machine guns for anti-air armament. The guns are mounted in a twin-barrelled setup on the ship's superstructure. The guns have very poor damage output and will not help to deter any aircraft and PT boats that come close to the Kako. This leaves the 120 mm guns as the only reliable defensive weapons against PT boats.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 8 No.2 (610 mm)}}

The Kako is loaded with 24 x 610 mm Type 8 No.2 torpedoes, launched from fixed launchers on each side of the ship. From each side can be launched up to 12 torpedoes, with six loaded inside the tube and other six in the ready racks. While the torpedoes are not as fast or powerful as the famous Type 93 torpedoes, they still pack 380.6 kg of TNT equivalent, which can sink a destroyer in a single hit and deal a considerable amount of damage against cruisers. Unfortunately, the aforementioned fixed torpedo launchers will limit the usage of the torpedoes, as you will have to move your hull to adjust your torpedo aim and exposing your vulnerable sides. Thus it is mostly suitable for mid-to-long range area denial barrages.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships is a catapult with one E7K2 scout plane which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The E7K2 is equipped with only defensive machine gun turrets (ventral as well as dorsal) but it does carry 4 x 60 kg bombs. It also has the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilize the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new! Carrying a heavier bomb load than most other scout planes, this unit has a very good chance to sink enemy boats or even a destroyer.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Kako's playstyle mostly depends on the opponent she faces. In a match with the same tier opponents such as destroyers and early light cruisers, the Kako is capable of pushing the targets by lending its devastating firepower at its battle rating to quickly dispatch the opponents while tanking hits in return. Otherwise when facing more advanced and better-protected cruisers, the Kako can act as a fire support ship, delivering powerful salvo and launching barrages of torpedoes at longer ranges. Her main anti-air armament are the 120 mm secondaries, especially when equipped in HE-TF shells, while they will rarely stop a dive bomber, they can score kills against a larger bombers at range, like a [[Pe-8]]. For that reason, it's best to stay near friendly (preferably non-Japanese) warships that can provide a more potent anti-air cover.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Created as a counter to the American Omaha and British Hawkins class cruisers, the Furutaka class was designed to act as a scouting cruiser capable of protecting the main fleet from enemy scouts. While the ship was designed before the Washington Naval Treaty, she still fell within the displacement and calibre limits with 7,500 tons of displacement and the main armament of six 7.9 in/20 cm cannons mounted in single turrets; she also had a torpedo armament of 12 x 21-inch torpedo tubes mounted in the hull. These armaments would change as both Furutaka and Kako were modernized shortly after being completed, with their single mounted guns being replaced with three twin turrets and two quad-torpedo launchers being added near the aft.

During the first months of the Pacific War against the United States, Kako was assigned to Sentai 6 and tasked in covering the invasions of several islands including Guam, Wake, and New Guinea. Sentai 6 was then assigned to Operation MO, the invasion of Port Morseby, and partook in the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 7, 1942. Their next major action would not be until August, but would also be their largest. Kako and Sentai 6 had been assigned to the new Eighth Fleet. In response to the American invasion of Guadalcanal, the Eighth Fleet sortied out to counter the invasion force. On the night of August 8-9, 1942, Kako and the fleet of 4 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, and a destroyer surprised the Allied Fleet in a night attack off Savo Island.

Fighting at close ranges with searchlights, flares, and star shells, Japanese naval artillery devastated the Allied fleet, sinking 4 heavy cruisers and forcing the American support ships to abandon the Marines on the island. While the battle was a stunning victory for the Japanese, they failed to sink any of the landing ships and fled the area for fear of retaliation from American carrier planes; However, it was the American submarine S-44 who got revenge. On August 10, while the Eighth fleet was returning to Rabaul, the S-44 fired four torpedoes at Kako, scoring three hits. The Kako quickly took on a list before her boilers detonated, sinking the cruiser but only taking 68 sailors with her. Kako was struck from the Japanese Naval list a month later.
