The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (清霜, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Clear Frost) is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/6163-development-the-japanese-fleet-in-war-thunder-pre-orders-for-the-pg-02-and-kiyoshimo-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6694-shop-may-sale-in-war-thunder-en|2020 May sale]]. It has since been made available temporarily for purchase in-game with Golden Eagles ({{GE}}) for the [[wt:en/news/7549-special-national-foundation-day-in-japan-en|2022 "Day of Japan"]], [[wt:en/news/8082-special-national-foundation-day-in-japan-en|2023 "National Foundation Day in Japan"]] and [[wt:en/news/8340--en|2023 "JSDF Day"]] mini-events.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!--''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''-->

Kiyoshimo's profile is rather low compared to destroyers of other factions, mainly because of being top-heavy. This in effect gives her a better chance of avoiding enemy fire, especially at long-range engagements, even as an overall longer ship. Additionally, her survivability further is aided by having ammunition stored deep underneath the water line, which ensures survival if faced with AP shells and having torpedo turrets protected against fragmentation damage, though they are still one of the easiest components to damage on the ship.

=== Mobility ===

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|127 mm/50 3rd Year Type (127 mm)}}

The Kiyoshimo has six 127 mm dual purpose guns that have a high velocity and flat trajectory that enables you to easily hit targets at 10 km. With an Ace crew, you can reduce the reload rate to ~6 seconds, which enables you to win long ranged gunfights. If the Kiyoshimo is caught at close range, it is suggested to take out the enemies turrets and go for crew as these guns lack any type of AP shells.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|25 mm/60 Type 96 (25 mm)}}

The Kiyoshimo is armed with twenty-eight 25 mm anti-aircraft guns as its secondary armament. These are effective at close range as they can throw a lot of shells into the air, but it is recommended to stay near allied ships for air cover as the range of these guns is short.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
{{main|Type 93 (13.2 mm)}}

<!--''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.''-->

On top of her 28 x 25 mm anti-air arsenal, she has 4 x 13.2 mm machine guns across the ship which on their own don't offer too much firepower, and should be used in unison with 25 mm cannons to clear PTs and air targets.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 93 Model 3 (610 mm)|Type 95 depth charge}}

The Kiyoshimo's torpedoes are the special Type 93 Mod 3 torpedoes, the other users being the [[IJN Akizuki]] and [[IJN Shimakaze]]. It has reduced range of 15 km compared to the standard 20 km [[Type 93 Model 1, Mod 2 (610 mm)|Type 93 Model 1]]s found on other Japanese ships. While not gaining any speed advantage, it does gain an even larger warhead: ~1000 kg of TNT instead of ~600 kg. These torpedoes have a tendency to destroy anything they hit. These are especially useful in Naval EC.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good top speed
* Good manoeuvrability
* 2 quad torpedo launchers with one reload each
* Very deadly torpedoes
* 127 mm guns have good ballistics
* 28 x 25 mm AA with a lot of ammunition

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turret traverse
* Turrets tend to be taken out often
* 25 mm AA only effective at close range (max range about 3 km)
* 127 mm guns have no AP (Only HE and HE-DF)
* 127 mm guns are almost useless against air targets (due to slow traverse)

== History ==
<!-- Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History) and add a link to it here using the main template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <ref></ref>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <references />. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under === In-game description ===, also if applicable). -->
IJN Kiyoshimo (清霜, "Clear Frost") was a ship of the [[Yugumo (Family)|Yugumo]] class built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the Second World War. As an incremental improvement over the previous Kagero class, Kiyoshimo had an improved anti-aircraft armament. Completed in May of 1944, Kiyoshimo was present at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and was ultimately sunk by American land-based bombers in December of that year.

=== Design ===
The Yugumo class was essentially a slightly-improved version of the preceding Kagero class of destroyers, armed with a heavier anti-aircraft armament. They displaced 2110 tons at standard load and had a crew complement of 228 officers and crew. Kiyoshimo carried a main armament of six 127 mm Type 3 guns in three dual turrets - one fore and two aft. These guns were designed with a high maximum rate of elevation to be used as dual-purpose guns, but their slow fire rate and lack of high-angle rangefinding devices severely hampered their effectiveness against aircraft.

Kiyoshimo carried a secondary armament of twenty-eight 25 mm anti-aircraft guns in fourteen single, four triple and one dual turrets. These weapons were the standard anti-aircraft guns for all Japanese warships during the Second World War. Kiyoshimo carried a torpedo armament of two quadruple 610 mm torpedo tube mounts firing the dreaded “Long Lance” torpedoes, along with four reloads. Her anti-submarine armament comprised two depth charge throwers with 36 depth charges.

=== Service history ===
Kiyoshimo was completed in May of 1944, after which she was immediately sent to join the Japanese forces in the Philippines. She was present at the Battle of Leyte gulf and was hit by an American bomb, and received five near-misses. She assisted the battleship Musashi after she was hit by numerous bombs, and later evacuated the survivors when the battleship sank. She was repaired in Singapore in November of that year. On December 26th, Kiyoshimo was at sea when she was crippled by American bombers, and finished off by a torpedo from the torpedo boat PT-223. 82 men were killed, while the destroyer Asashimo rescued 169 survivors and American PT boats rescued five.
