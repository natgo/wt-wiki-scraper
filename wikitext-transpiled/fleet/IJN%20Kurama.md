The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (鞍馬, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Mount Kurama), was the final vessel constructed within its class, which comprised two armoured cruisers. These ships were originally ordered for service during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. Designed to carry armament comparable to battleships and to operate alongside them despite a lower displacement, their construction was overshadowed by the prioritization of the Kawachi-class and the repair/reconstruction of ex-Russian vessels captured at Tsushima. It wasn't until 1911 that both ships were finally commissioned, by which time they were already outdated compared to the emerging battlecruiser class, offering superior speeds and armament. Following their belated commissioning, these cruisers found themselves participating in various ceremonial events. Kurama attended the Coronation of King George V and accompanied fleet review in 1914. Subsequently, during World War I, she served as an Allied vessel, safeguarding Allied merchant shipping in the South Pacific and supporting landings on German-occupied Caroline and Mariana Islands. In the 1920s, Kurama was assigned to the northern fleet, where she played a role in covering the landings of Japanese troops in Russia during the Siberian Intervention, providing support to White Russian forces. However, the fate of the Kurama-class was sealed by the Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated their scrapping.

It was introduced during [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8494-event-tokushu-heiki-assemble-and-test-an-honorable-missile-to-obtain-prizes-en|2023 Tokushu Heiki event]]. As an Armoured Cruiser predating WWI, Kurama offers the firepower and speed akin to battleships, albeit with the armour profile of a heavy cruiser. Due to her age, she primarily contends with light and heavy cruisers from the WWI to WWII era. Equipped with an array of formidable guns, Kurama can effectively engage both destroyers and cruisers, with her main batteries possessing the capability to pose a threat even to battleships. This positions her best at the rear of the fleet, where she can provide support to other vessels and engage enemy ships from a distance. Despite her impressive offensive capabilities, Kurama is hindered by her slow speed and relatively weak armour. Additionally, a notable drawback is her lack of anti-aircraft defenses. Reflecting her 1920s configuration, which predates the recognition of the importance of aerial power, Kurama is outfitted with only 76 mm and 47 mm cannons for AA-defense, leaving her vulnerable to aerial attacks.

Like many larger ships before and during World War I, internal torpedo tubes were installed on the ship, primarily as supplementary armament for close-range combat against enemy vessels.

However, these should not be utilized under normal circumstances. They are intended for use only in the event of a dire situation where engagement ranges are extremely close and other guns are inoperative, a scenario which ideally the captain of Kurama would seek to avoid. The torpedo tubes are best left empty as they are unlikely to see much use to begin with, or they could be kept in reserve in case the Kurama frequently finds itself under attack by destroyers rushing its position.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Utilizing the Kurama effectively requires a nuanced understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. With its formidable 305 mm cannons, the Kurama excels at both leading assaults and providing support, depending on the situation at hand.

When facing lighter targets such as destroyers and cruisers, the Kurama's main guns can devastate them with high-explosive (HE) rounds. Meanwhile, its secondaries provide continuous fire, ensuring sustained pressure on the enemy. A strategic approach involves loading HE in the main guns for maximum damage to lightly armoured foes, while reserving armour-piercing (AP) rounds for the secondaries to deal with closer-range engagements.

However, the Kurama's lacklustre armour makes it vulnerable to ships with heavier armaments. To mitigate this risk, maintaining distance from battleships and battlecruisers is crucial. Attempting to rush these formidable adversaries would likely result in swift defeat due to the Kurama's poor armour and mobility. Instead, adopting a sniping approach by utilizing the main guns from a safe distance and bombarding them with secondary armaments proves more effective.

Furthermore, given the Kurama's deficient anti-aircraft defense, sticking close to teammates is advisable. This allows for mutual support and protection against aerial threats, compensating for the Kurama's vulnerability in this aspect. By understanding and leveraging these tactics, players can maximize the Kurama's potential on the battlefield, ensuring its effectiveness in combat scenarios.

=== Construction ===
In 1904, the temporary military budget for the Russo-Japanese War was sanctioned. By January 31, 1905, construction orders were dispatched to Yokosuka. By June 11 of that year, the Imperial Japanese Navy provisionally christened the armoured cruiser as "Kurama" (initially slated to be named Ibuki). On August 23, the construction of the armoured cruiser Kurama commenced at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Then, on October 21, 1907, precisely at 3:07 p.m. (from the third slipway), the ship was launched, graced by the presence of Emperor Meiji and Empress Haruko (later Empress Dowager Shōken) at the launch ceremony. Weighing in at 6,380 British tons, Kurama smoothly entered the waters of Yokosuka, marking a successful launch. Simultaneously, the armoured cruiser was formally christened as "Kurama" and classified as a first-class cruiser (armoured cruiser). By February 28, 1911, construction was completed. Initially designed to be a fast vessel with firepower rivaling that of the Katori-class battleships, Kurama found itself outdated upon launch due to the emergence of dreadnoughts and battlecruisers. On March 1 of the same year, she was integrated into the Second Fleet.

===Usage===
====Pre-War====
;Mission to Britain
Immediately after being commissioned, Kurama, accompanied by the second-class cruiser Tone (a protected cruiser built in 1907), embarked to Britain under the command of Vice Admiral Hayao Shimamura. There they partook in the coronation fleet review of King George V. In late March 1911, Vice Admiral Shimamura and the crews of Kurama and Tone were granted an audience with Emperor Meiji. Setting sail on April 1 from Yokosuka, the two cruisers participated in the fleet review at Spithead on June 24. Subsequently, on either November 12 or 22, they returned to Yokosuka. By December 1, She was withdrawn from the 2nd Fleet.

;After
* Feb. 20, 1912: '''3-inch guns on top of the main gun turrets were added.'''
* Aug. 28, 1912: The IJN revised the classification table for naval vessels. {{Annotation|Four ships|Chikuma, Ikoma, Kurama, and Ibuki}}, including Kurama, were reclassified as '''battlecruisers'''.
* Dec. 1, 1912: Assigned into the 1st Fleet.
** Feb. 10, 1913: 1st Fleet stationed in Takao, Japanese-Taiwan conducted naval patrols in the southern Qingdao area.

* Aug. 23, 1914: Japan declares war on Germany, joining World War I

On September 14, the 1st Southern Expeditionary Unit was formed with Kurama as the flagship, accompanied by Tsukuba, Asama, the 16th Destroyer Flotilla (Umikaze, Yamakaze), Nankai Maru, and Enkai Maru. Departing from Futami Port on September 17, they engaged in merchant convoy protection and provided support for the landings of the German-held Mariana and Caroline Islands. They returned to Yokosuka Naval Base on January 17 of the following year.

** July 25, 1918: While undergoing repairs, removed from the 5th Squadron
* Dec. 1, 1918: Reassigned to the 3rd Fleet, 5th Squadron (Kurama, Ibuki, Mikasa)

====Siberian intervention====
The Siberian Intervention, from a Japanese perspective, was Japan's military involvement in Siberia from 1918 to 1922 during the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. Japan, along with several other Allied nations, sent troops to intervene in the Russian Civil War with the goal of securing economic and strategic interests in the region. The Japanese forces primarily aimed to safeguard the Trans-Siberian Railway, protect Japanese nationals, and counter Bolshevik influence. Despite initial successes, the intervention faced logistical challenges, diplomatic tensions, and opposition from local Bolshevik forces. Japan gradually withdrew its troops from Siberia by 1922, with the intervention ultimately having mixed results and implications for Japan's foreign policy in the region.

Kurama was assigned to support during the whole intervention and sailed along the Russian coast.

* Sep.-Oct., 1919: '''Two 40 cm signal searchlights installed at Sasebo'''
* Dec. 1, 1920: Removed from the 3rd Fleet, 5th Squadron - This would be the last time assigned to a fleet

====Washington Naval Treaty====
In late 1921, as the political aftermath of World War I drew to a close and concerns over a potential naval arms race mounted among major powers, discussions for the Washington Naval Treaty commenced. This multilateral agreement, signed in 1922, involved key naval players such as the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Italy. Its primary objective was to curb naval armaments and forestall an escalation of military tensions by introducing disarmament ratios and limitations on specific types of warships. Among its significant provisions were caps on both the total tonnage and armaments of capital ships, along with constraints on the construction of new capital ships and aircraft carriers. Representing a concerted effort to preserve peace and stability in the aftermath of World War I, the treaty sought to diminish the naval capabilities of participating nations while advocating for arms control measures.

The Kurama-class, like many other ships, was destined to be decommissioned in accordance with the Treaty, expelled from the naval register on September 20, 1923. Her armament was removed at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, followed by torpedo tubes, and finally her boilers. On January 19, 1925, the hulk of Kurama was demolished and scrapped by Kobe Steel Works.
