== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (最上, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Mogami River) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese heavy cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The IJN Mogami is one of the most well protected cruisers in the game, with 140 mm of RHA covering the entire front and rear ammunition stowages, 100 mm of RHA protecting the engine compartment, 105 mm of RHA bulkheads, though this will NOT stop other heavy cruisers from ammoracking you if you do not angle. The ship has 910 crew which is just mediocre for a heavy cruiser. The major downside of this ship is its extremely thin (25.4 mm) turret armour so users will have a hard time dealing with HE spam from US destroyers and light cruisers.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility}}

The ship can reach a max speed of 64 km/h (RB), with the complete rudder's turning time of 4.05 seconds (aced crew) which is one of the best for heavy cruisers.

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 93 Model 1, Mod 2 (610 mm)}}

Four triple-mount 610 mm Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo launchers, with two on each side. Altogether, the IJN Mogami carries 24 torpedoes total.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships are two catapults carrying one Aichi E13A1 scout plane each (the [[E7K2]] stored on the trolley is not available) which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The E13A1 is equipped with a [[Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm Type 97]] defensive machine gun and a formidable load of 4 x 60 kg bombs. It also has the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilize the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new! Carrying a heavier bomb load than most other scout planes, this unit has a very good chance to sink enemy boats or even a destroyer.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list.

[[File:Mogami running trials in 1935.jpg|thumb|500x500px|Mogami as seen during her sea trial, 1935. Note her pre-refit 6-inch main armament.]]
IJN Mogami was a ship of the Mogami class of light cruisers, built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the interwar period. Designed to be converted into heavy cruisers later on, they were the largest and most heavily-armed cruisers ever built until the introduction of the American Brooklyn-class several years later. Mogami was launched in 1935, and saw extensive service across all theatres of the Pacific war. Later on, she was converted into an aircraft cruiser with her entire rear deck replaced by a hangar emplacement similar to those found on the Tone-class cruisers. Mogami was sunk during the battle of Leyte Gulf, along with her sister ship Suzuya; none of the four Mogami-class cruisers would survive the Second World War.

=== Design and development ===
Mogami was the first of four Mogami-class cruisers. To comply with the Washington Naval Treaty, she was initially classified as a light cruiser with an official displacement of 8,500 tons. However, she was designed from the outset to be refitted with 8-inch (203 mm) guns and made into a heavy cruiser in a later refit. Her main armament consisted of fifteen 6-inch (152 mm) guns in five triple turrets, giving her one of the heaviest broadsides of any Treaty cruiser. She was also fitted with moderate anti-aircraft protection and four triple torpedo tube launchers carrying the deadly Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedoes.

Mogami's relatively heavy armour and large armament placed extensive strain on the 10,000-ton limit that she was built to comply with. In fact, a British Admiral once quipped that "(The Japanese) are either lying to us or building (the Mogamis) out of cardboard." Indeed, the low displacement gave the Mogami relatively weak stability, which was improved later on through the addition of large bulges on the sides of the hull. Mogami was commissioned in 1935, but didn't see much service before the outbreak of war as engineers refitted her with her 8-inch guns as well as the aforementioned hull bulges.

=== Operational history ===
After her commissioning, the Mogami returned to drydock yet again. It had been discovered during her sea trials that her hull was highly unstable, and thus she was given large hull bulges to remedy the instability. Her armament was also replaced with her intended complement of 10 8-inch (203 mm) guns in five dual turrets. Starting from 1940, she participated in the occupation of French Southeast Asia with her sister ship Mikuma.

After the Pearl Harbour attacks, Mogami covered the invasion of British Borneo. There, she encountered an enemy force attacking Japanese landing personnel, composed of the American cruiser USS Houston and Australian cruiser HMAS Perth. Along with her escorting destroyers and sister ship Mikuma, the Japanese force was able to destroy both cruisers quickly. Mogami herself emerged relatively unscathed, and spent the latter part of early 1942 attacking shipping in the Southeast Asian area.
[[File:Mogami after Midway.jpg|thumb|Mogami's destroyed bow after her collision with her sister ship Mikuma.]]
In June of 1942, Mogami was one of the escort ships tasked with escorting the Japanese Carrier fleet on the attack on Midway Atoll. However, as they had left later than the rest of the fleet, they lagged behind and the order was given for them to slow down and proceed at a leisurely speed. However, the order was received late, and Mogami, along with her sister ships Suzuya, Kumano and Mikuma, was already within 90 kilometres of Midway atoll. They were spotted by an American submarine, and due to some communication errors, Mogami ended up colliding with the Mikuma, her bow shearing into the Mikuma's port hull. The two ships ended up stuck to each other, and the Japanese crews worked frantically to resolve the collision.

The rest of the Japanese convoy continued on their course, leaving several destroyers to escort the cruisers. During this time, the two cruisers were attacked by a flight of B-17s from Midway that failed to score any hits. Finally, the ships were unstuck, and Mogami was headed towards Wake Island when the pair of cruisers were attacked by a flight of 31 SBD Dauntlesses from the carriers Enterprise and Hornet. Mogami was hit by six bombs and severely damaged, while Mikuma was sunk.

Mogami returned to port for repairs. During this time, it was decided to convert her into an aircraft-carrying cruiser similar to the Tone-class. Her damaged rear turrets were both removed and replaced with a spacious flight deck for operating up to 11 seaplanes. She also received a bolstered anti-aircraft armament with 30 additional 25 mm anti-aircraft guns being fitted. It was in this capacity that the Mogami spent the later part of 1943, primarily as a patrol and scout ship off of the Marshall Islands.

In June of 1944, Mogami made up part of the force headed to the Philippines to fend against the inbound American invasion force. This attempt failed miserably as the remnants of the Japanese naval air arm was destroyed in the "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot", and the carrier Hiyo was sunk by torpedoes. Mogami retired back to Okinawa, where she was given an additional refit of anti-aircraft guns - this brought her total to 60 barrels.

In October, Mogami returned to the Philippines as part of the Japanese force that would engage in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles ever fought. Her floatplanes discovered a force of 12 carriers on the morning of October 24th 1944, as well as numerous battleships, cruisers and destroyers. Soon after, the Japanese force was attacked by American surface forces, and Mogami suffered two hits from USS Portland, which destroyed her bridge and killed her commanding officers.

Soon after, she collided with the Japanese cruiser Nachi and suffered severe damage when the collision set fires that caused her torpedoes to explode and disable her starboard engines. She was then hit by multiple heavy salvoes from the American cruisers, which disabled her port engine. Battered by enemy shells and bombs from Carrier-based TBM Avengers, the order was given to abandon ship. She stayed afloat for several hours more, until a torpedo from an escorting destroyer finally sent her to the bottom. In this engagement, her sister-ship Suzuya was also sunk.

=== [[wt:en/news/6359-development-mogami-going-all-out-en|Devblog]] ===
Development of the Mogami-class cruiser dates back to the early 1930s, when the IJN launched its development as part of a naval rearmament program. Wishing to substantially strengthen their navy's cruisers, the IJN high command ordered for a new design to be drawn up which would practically reach the very limits of the London Naval Treaty in effect at the time.

The new warship was initially set at a displacement of 8,500 tons and was to be armed with fifteen 155 mm guns, spread across five triple turrets. However, even at the design stage it was already clear that the real displacement would significantly exceed this limit and would be around 11,000 tons so it was decided to conceal the true data. In December of 1934, Japan denounced the Washington Agreements, and refused to sign the Second London Treaty in January of 1936. As a result, in the period between 1939 and 1940 all cruisers of the Mogami type underwent reconstruction, in which the main weapons were replaced by ten 203 mm guns in five turrets, the ships were then formally reclassified as heavy cruisers.

Nonetheless, Mogami-class cruisers raised concerns with other naval powers, some simply dismissed their design specifications as being false, while others, such as the U.S., began building counterparts of their own. Four Mogami-class heavy cruisers took part in several major operations during WW2, including the Battle of Midway, Leyte Gulf and many others. All ships of the class were lost in combat between June 1942 - November 1944.
