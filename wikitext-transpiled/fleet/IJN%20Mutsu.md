== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The Nagato-class battleship '''Mutsu''' of the Imperial Japanese Navy was laid down in 1918, launched in 1920, and commissioned in 1921. She was one of the "Big 7" battleships allowed to retain 16-inch guns under the Washington Naval Treaty. She played a significant role in Japan's interwar policy. During the Second World War, Mutsu participated in several operations, including the Battle of Midway and the Guadalcanal campaign, though she never engaged in direct combat. Her career came to an end on 8 June 1943 when a magazine explosion at Hashirajima anchorage split the ship in two, resulting in the loss of 1,121 crew members.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]]. She was the first 16-inch vessel in the game, trading excellent damage output for lower survivability, particularly due to her aft magazines being exposed above the waterline. She is also a very easy target for enemy bombers, being defended solely by four [[3-inch/40 Type 41 (76 mm)|76 mm]] guns. Overall, though, she is an excellent surface combatant and one of the most dangerous enemies in the top tier.

The battleship '''Mutsu''' was laid down at Yokosuka Navy Yard on 1 June 1918 and launched on 31 May 1920. Along with Nagato, she was one of Japan's most capable warships at the time of commissioning in October 1921, quickly becoming a symbol of national pride and a central element of the First Fleet. During her early years, Mutsu took part in various naval manoeuvres, including a high-profile visit from the Prince of Wales in 1922. The battleship also played a significant role during Japan's withdrawal from Siberia and participated in relief efforts following the Great Kanto Earthquake in September 1923. In the 1930s, she underwent multiple refits to modernise her armament, propulsion, and defences.

Mutsu played a significant role in the Washington Naval Treaty negotiations of 1922. Initially slated for scrapping, Japanese delegates successfully argued for her retention, citing her recent commissioning and operational status. This decision made Mutsu one of the "Big 7" battleships, vessels allowed to retain their 16-inch (406 mm) main guns under the treaty. The "Big 7" also included her sister ship Nagato, three American Colorado-class, and two British Nelson-class battleships. Her preservation under the treaty ensured Japan maintained a strong naval presence in the interwar period, though it came at the cost of allowing other nations to build additional capital ships to maintain the agreed-upon ratios.

During World War II, Mutsu was part of the Combined Fleet's 1st Battleship Division, primarily operating in Japanese home waters. She participated in Operation Z, the attack on Pearl Harbor, by patrolling the [[wikipedia:Bonin Islands|Ogasawara Islands]]. Later, she participated in the Battle of Midway as part of the Main Body from 4-5 June 1942. In the latter half of 1942, she supported operations in the Guadalcanal campaign. July 1942 saw her transfer to the 2nd Battleship Division, where she continued to serve, avoiding direct engagement in significant naval battles. Her limited operational use reflected Japan's strategic priority on conserving capital ships as the war situation became increasingly dire.

On 8 June 1943, while anchored at Hashirajima, Mutsu suffered a catastrophic internal explosion in her No. 3 magazine, splitting the ship in two. The cause of the explosion remains debated, with theories ranging from accidental detonation to sabotage. The sinking resulted in the loss of over 1,121 officers and crew, marking a tragic end for one of Japan's greatest battleships.

As part of the naval rearmament program leading up to and during WWI, the Japanese navy was constructing a number of new battleships and battlecruisers, incorporating the latest technologies. IJN Mutsu was one of these ships, being ordered into construction in June 1918 and seeing completion in 1921. Along with her sistership, IJN Nagato, they were the first warships in the world to be fitted with 16" cannons, which greatly increased their firepower and range. Being subject to several upgrades and modernizations in the interwar period, Mutsu entered WWII as one of the most powerful battleships in the world. However, this warship only saw limited combat action and was tragically lost in 1943 while at port due to a catastrophic magazine detonation which destroyed the ship and caused many losses.
