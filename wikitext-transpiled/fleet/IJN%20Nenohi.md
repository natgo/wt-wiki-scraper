== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (子日, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: New Year Day) is the second ship of her class and appears in a refit after the realization of the top-heavy design being a crucial vulnerability. Unlike [[Hatsuharu]] in her pre-commission fit, Nenohi's armament layout is more like conventional Japanese destroyers. Nenohi saw early service in the invasion of French Indochina as a radio post and took part in the Aleutian campaign in the Pacific theatre.

It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]]. Being a later refit of the [[Hatsuharu]], her layout is more conventional to the Japanese norm and exchanges frontal firepower and total torpedo count for the better [[Type 93 (610 mm) (Family)|Type 93 oxygen torpedoes]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
While being of the Hatsuharu class, her kind had to be rebuilt (twice) to make up for structural weakness. This results in Nenohi being slightly longer, displacing more tons (1,981 t → 2,229 t) after her last refit and hence carrying more crew (212 → 240). While the metals used to rebuild Nenohi are of better quality, the thickness was reduced to save on weight while having the same armour effectiveness. The bridge is slightly further from the first funnel decreasing the chance of both funnel and bridge being taken out in the same salvo.

The change of armament layout also benefits the survivability of Nenohi over [[Hatsuharu]], with the frontal single mount turret being moved to the stern of the ship, so there is only one forward barbette with ready rack ammo above the waterline, and the decrease of total torpedoes loaded onboard is less of an exploding vulnerability.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Nenohi being slightly longer than her initial design, her total displacement increased from 1,981 t to 2,229 t, this without change in propulsion makes her slightly less manoeuvrable and slower than Hatsuharu.

{{main|Type 93 Model 1, Mod 2 (610 mm)|Type 95 depth charge}}

As a 1942 ship, her 610 mm torpedo tubes are loaded with Japan's state-of-the-art Type 93 oxygen torpedoes which can cause a lot of damage and havoc in the waters she and other Japanese ships sail. Just like most Japanese ships and the torpedo doctrine of the Japanese navy, she offers two turrets with 3 tubes totalling 6 tubes, which can be reloaded once.

Additionally, Nenohi can be equipped with Type 95 depth charges, which in War Thunder can only really be used in extreme occasions when patrol boats pass through the 25 mm firing arc and sit at the stern of Nenohi, being able to defend herself by dropping the charges.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Playing like any Japanese destroyer, the main selling point is the torpedo arsenal. She carries the very deadly and fast Type 93 oxygen torpedo which can beat ships 20x her size. At the lower ranks and downtiers Nenohi can face, her 12.7 cm cannons can cause plenty of damage against other destroyers and lighter vessels. Once Nenohi starts facing bigger targets, the best tactic in arcade battles is to sail away from combat range and utilize torpedoes as the primary weapon, while leaving the 12.7 cm's for close-range self-defence. In realistic battles, torpedoes should be preserved for hits that are 100% certain to hit, as reloading torpedoes on objectives is a lengthy process and not very practical.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Possesses the Type 93 oxygen torpedo
* Decently hitting 12.7 cm cannons at her tier

'''Cons:'''

* Fairly weak anti-air defence of only 2 dual mount 25 mm's
* Lacks armour-piercing shells for the 12.7 cm
* Slow turret traverse

=== Operational history ===

;Early Service

Commissioned in September 1933, the second ship of the Hatsuharu-class Nenohi was quickly returned together with Hatsuharu to the dockyard after the "Tomozuru Incident" to fix the flaw in top-heavy design. After the refit, she and her class were assigned to the 1st Fleet, training up her crew as a new ship until 1940, reassigned to the 2nd Expeditionary Fleet and patrolling and escorting Japanese troops landing in French Indochina. During the initial stage of the invasion, she was docked in Hanoi and served as an ad-hoc radio station to coordinate wireless communications, later she would be rebased in Haiphong while maintaining her role there.

;Pacific Service
[[File:Nenohi Historical.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Nenohi photographed by US intellegence]]

At the start of the Pacific war with the attack on Pearl Harbour, Nenohi was assigned as flagship of the 21st Destroyer Division under the 1st Fleet again and remained in Japanese home waters on ASW patrol. In late January 1942, she was deployed with the invasion force of the Dutch East Indies, covering landing operations at Kendari on Sulawesi, Bali and Lombok as part of "Operation H". She returned to Sasebo Naval Arsenal at the end of March for maintenance.

From May 1942, she was reassigned to northern operations and partook in "Operation AL" in support of the Aleutians campaign, patrolling around Attu, Kiska, and Amchitka Island. On the 21st of May, while refuelling from the Fuji Maru, the crew spotted a submarine at 800 m at the stern of the Nenohi, attacked it with Type 95 depth charges and reported it sunk. Upon receiving the report, the 5th Fleet ordered the confirmation, identification, and any documents on the submarine. The search party was abandoned on the 3rd of July without any trace of the submarine.

;Sinking

During the escort of the seaplane tender Kamikawa Maru in the afternoon of 5th of July, sailing at 9 knots (16 km/h) in a dense fog with less than 2 km visibility range, Nenohi was torpedoed by USS Triton southeast of Attu, near Agattu Island at 12:50. The ship was hit by a single torpedo starboard amidships, splitting her hull and sinking. The surviving crew and captain from the initial hit climbed the side of the capsized ship in 2 minutes to stay above water, chanting 「子ノ日万歳 (Neno-Hi Banzai)」 until disappearing in the cold water 5 minutes later. Even though it was summer, the Aleutian waters were very cold and with the fog being too thick, any kind of help came too late for 188 crew members including the captain. The next day the seaplane force suspended operations for the day at Kiska island and dispatched the destroyer Inazuma to find any remaining survivors, 38 who drifted their way onto land on Cape Sabak of Agattu Island survived and were rescued. On 31 July 1942, Nenohi was scrapped from the navy list.
