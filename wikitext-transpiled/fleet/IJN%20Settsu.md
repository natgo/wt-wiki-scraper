== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (摂津, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Settsu Province) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese battleship {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High firepower and durability
* Carries torpedoes

'''Cons:'''

* Poor mobility
* Meagre anti-air defence
* Huge profile

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Following the end of the Russo-Japanese War in the early 1900's, the state of the IJN was generally perceived to be unsatisfactory by high ranking Japanese officials. Furthermore, in terms of quantity and quality, the Japanese navy was lagging behind other naval powers such as Great Britain or the United States. In addition to all this, a severe economic recession following the war greatly reduced Japan's ability to build new warships and expand its naval power.

Nonetheless, a new fleet expansion strategy was adopted and whose first steps were the construction of two new dreadnought-type battleships. This resulted in the creation of the Kawachi-class, made up from the battleships Kawachi and Settsu. These two warships became the first two dreadnought-type battleships to be built by Japan.

Settsu was laid down in January 1908 at the Kure Naval Arsenal, launched in March 1911 and completed in July 1912. During WWI, Settsu served alongside her sistership, but seeing only limited action. In 1919, Settsu was put in reserve, receiving an overhaul before being disarmed in 1922 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

Shortly after, Settsu was converted into a target ship, keeping this role throughout the interwar period as well as WWII. In the end, Settsu was badly damaged by an Allied air raid on Kure in July 1945, leaving the ship beached. The ship's hulk was subsequently raised and broken up for scrap in the immediate postwar years.
