== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (鈴谷, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Suzuya River) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|155 mm/60 3rd Year Type (155 mm)}}

Suzuya's main armament consists of 15 x 155 mm/60 3rd Year Type cannons mounted in five triple turrets in A-B-Cs-X-Y setup. Due to the guns' setup, Suzuya is able to deliver a full salvo at a steep 60 degrees angle, thus increasing the ship's protection effectiveness.

The 155 mm guns have three shell choices: a rudimentary HE shell with 3.39 kg of TNT equivalent, an APHEBC shell with high penetration (131 mm at 10 km) and a sizeable filler of 1.21 kg of TNT equivalent, and an HE-TF shell with the same filler as the HE shell, though is not useful due to the gun's slow reload and traverse. As with other similar guns, both shells have high shell velocity at 920 m/s and thus are reasonably accurate at all ranges.

The guns have a rather mediocre rate of fire for its calibre at 6 RPM (10 second reload with ace crew) compared to other 150-155 mm guns with 7-8 RPM as baseline. This is made up with the sheer volume of rounds it can deliver for each salvo, with a well-aimed barrage capable of causing severe damage to the enemy ship.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|5 inch/40 Type 89 (127 mm)}}

Suzuya features 8 x 127 mm/40 Type 89 dual-purpose guns in four twin turrets placed around the funnel, which are reasonably effective against coastal boats and destroyers due to fast reload time. As with the main guns, it has two shell choices of a basic HE shell and a HE-TF shell with slightly higher filler but much better shell velocity (910 m/s).

Since Suzuya's dedicated anti-air weapons are quite weak, it is possible to use the 127 mm as a supplementary flak battery. Due to the HE-TF shell's high velocity, it can be surprisingly effective at longer ranges, though its performance gradually decreases as the enemy gets closer than 2 km.

''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.''

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships are two catapults each carrying one E8N2 scout plane (the third E8N2 and single [[E7K2]] stored on trolleys are not available) which provide unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The E8N2 is equipped with both an offensive machine gun and a defensive machine gun turret, and carries 2 x 60 kg bombs. It also has the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilize the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new!

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Features the same hull as the Mogami heavy cruiser; able to withstand a fair amount of enemy fire before sinking
* Lots of guns (5 turrets with 3 guns in each turret)
* 24 Long Lance torpedoes
* Anti-torpedo bulges along the hull are filled with water and can absorb explosions of up to 250 kg TNT equivalent
* Very fast for a cruiser of this size
* Two scout planes

'''Cons:'''

* Like most Japanese cruisers, very weak anti-aircraft armament
* Wide hull makes evading enemy torpedoes difficult as it takes some time to manoeuvre the ship
* Torpedo arcs are limited, have to show almost full broadside to launch torpedoes. Better rear angles than forward
* Slow rate of fire for the calibre of guns: guns have longer reload than equivalent guns in other nations
* Large, lightly armoured turrets can be easily knocked out

== History ==

The IJN ''Suzuya'' was the third of four [[Mogami (Family)|''Mogami''-class]] heavy cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese navy. To comply with the regulations of the Washington Naval Treaty, she was classified as a light cruiser and built with fifteen 6-inch (152 mm) guns. However, the ship was designed from the outset to be armed with dual 8-inch (203 mm) turrets, which were refitted onto the ship in 1937. ''Suzuya'' served extensively in the Second World War, participating in major conflicts such as the Battle of Midway, Solomon Islands campaign and the Battle of the Philippine Sea. ''Suzuya'' met her end at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, where she was crippled by American torpedo bombers and subsequently abandoned.

=== Design and construction ===
''Suzuya'' was the third of four ''Mogami''-class cruisers. To comply with the Washington Naval Treaty, she was initially classified as a light cruiser with an official displacement of 8,500 tons. However, she was designed from the outset to be refitted with 8-inch (203 mm) guns and made into a heavy cruiser in a later refit.<ref name=":0">Chen, C. (2007)</ref> Her main armament consisted of fifteen 6-inch (152 mm) guns in five triple turrets, giving her one of the heaviest broadsides of any Treaty cruiser. She was also fitted with moderate anti-aircraft protection and four triple torpedo tube launchers carrying the deadly Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedoes.<ref name=":0" />

''Suzuya'' was launched on November 20th 1934 at a ceremony attended by Emperor Hirohito. She was completed in January of 1936 but was immediately drydocked to allow her hull to be reinforced. She entered service in late 1937, but was immediately drydocked again to be refitted with her intended armament of ten 8-inch (203 mm) guns in five dual mounts.<ref name=":0" /> In-game, ''Suzuya'' appears in her pre-modification light cruiser configuration.

=== Operational history ===
[[File:Suzuya Sea Trials.jpg|thumb|400x400px|IJN Suzuya during sea trials, 1935]]
Following her rearmament, which was completed by December 30th 1939, ''Suzuya'' was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Division of the Japanese 2nd fleet, along with her sister ships ''[[IJN Mogami|Mogami]]'', ''[[IJN Mikuma|Mikuma]]'' and ''Kumano''. Before the war, she served primarily in the South China Sea, as well as the occupation of French Indochina.<ref name=":1">Hackett, B., & Kingsepp, S. (2018)</ref> At the time of the Pearl Harbour attack, she was covering the invasion of Malaya; she was subsequently part of a task force hunting for the British Force Z (consisting of the battleship ''Prince of Wales'', battlecruiser ''Repulse'' and escorting destroyers), but proved unsuccessful in locating her target; the ships were eventually sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

From April 1st 1942, ''Suzuya'' participated in commerce raiding in the Indian ocean, intercepting and destroying several Allied merchantmen. She went on to serve at the Battle of Midway, where she intended to shell the island in preparation for the Japanese invasion; this order was called off.<ref name=":1" /> She saw extensive service escorting the Japanese carrier fleet during the Solomon islands campaign, and participated in the bombing of Henderson Field at Guadalcanal. She was attacked by American torpedo-bombers, but survived unscathed.<ref name=":1" />

In mid-1944, ''Suzuya'' was part of the cruiser squadron escorting the Japanese carrier fleet on the Marianas campaign; however, American aircraft decimated the Japanese air group in the 'Great Marianas Turkey Shoot', resulting in the crippling of Japan's remaining carrier air group. She met her own demise just three months later, at the Battle of Leyte Gulf; attacked by American aircraft, a bomb near-miss caused her No. 1 torpedo tube, laden with Long Lance torpedoes, to explode.<ref name=":1" /> The resulting fire caused severe damage, and she was abandoned. ''Suzuya'' was removed from the navy list in December of 1944. Her wreck has never been found, and is believed to lie at a depth of almost 9 kilometres.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
