The IJN Tone is capable of carrying 24 Long Lance torpedoes in 4 sets of 3, 2 per side. Each torpedo tube has an onboard quick reload, so 12 torpedoes can be launched per side before needing to reload in a capture zone or port. One notable characteristic about the torpedo launchers is that the aft sets have better forward-firing angles than the fore sets, but the forward angles still aren't particularly incredible. However, all the sets have good rearward firing angles.

As the torpedoes are Long Lances, they can detonate if they are hit and will destroy the IJN Tone nearly 100% of the time. Essentially they are completely unarmored ammunition racks. Conversely, if an enemy ship is hit with a Long Lance, there is a high likelihood of destroying it outright or sinking it via flooding.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Devastating anti-aircraft armament
* 4 turrets placed in the bow providing amazing firepower while staying in cover
* Fast torpedoes with amazing range and damage potential
* Powerful secondary guns for a Japanese cruiser
* 250 kg of anti-torpedo protection bulges along the hull and good belt armour make this a durable ship
* Like other Japanese cruisers, very fast in a straight line

'''Cons:'''

* Turrets easily disabled due to very close proximity to each other
* Awkward gun placement means enemy ships can flank you without resistance
* Torpedoes are difficult to launch without showing broadside
* Extremely poor armor on main battery turrets, even AA caliber guns can disable them

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

[[File:Tone 1942.jpg|thumb|450x450px|Tone seen in 1942.]]
The IJN Tone was the lead ship of the Tone class of two heavy cruisers built for the Japanese navy. Designed as a scout cruiser to operate within large task forces, the ship was built with a unique armament scheme and a large rear deck for carrying seaplanes. Completed in 1938, she saw extensive service during the Second World war and served in many major battles including the Battles of Midway, Santa Cruz and Leyte. Relegated to training duties by early 1945, she was sunk by American naval aircraft in July of that year, and was later raised and scrapped.<ref name=":0">WWII Cruisers. (n.d.)</ref>

'''Design and construction'''

Tone, along with her sister ship Chikuma, were designed as a pair of heavy scout cruisers to provide long-range reconnaissance services to the Japanese carrier fleet. Due to the Japanese doctrine of not carrying reconnaissance aircraft on their carriers, the Tone carried six Aichi E13A reconnaissance floatplanes on a huge spacious rear-deck. Thus, the ship featured an unconventional main armament configuration - four twin 8-inch (203 mm) turrets all located forward of the superstructure.<ref name=":0" /> She also carried numerous anti-aircraft defences and four triple 610 mm torpedo launchers located at the sides. She displaced 11 500 tons, and could make 35 knots (65 km/h).<ref name=":0" />

The Tone was ordered in 1932, and was laid down on December 1st 1934. She was launched in November of 1937, and was commissioned on November 20th 1938.

'''Operational History'''

The Tone was present during the attack on Pearl Harbour in December of 1941, and launched her reconnaissance aircraft in support of the raid. She later participated in the Battle of Midway, where her floatplanes helped discover the inbound American carrier group. Later on, she participated in the Battle of the Solomon Islands, and the battle of Santa Cruz. During the latter engagement, the Tone played a major role in delivering supplies to the troops at Guadalcanal, and performing scouting duties for the Carrier task force.<ref name=":0" />

Tone then returned to the Japanese port of Kure to receive additional anti-aircraft guns. She served a short stint as a commerce raider in the Indian ocean, but was then reassigned to the Japanese carrier group as a scout and escort for the Battle of the Philippine Sea. At the battle of Leyte Gulf, Tone provided her floatplane scouting duties as required; she survived with minor damage while her sister ship Chikuma was sunk.<ref name=":0" /> At that point, she retired to the Japanese home islands, where she would stay for the remainder of the war. On July 24th 1945, Tone was attacked by USN aircraft; hit by nine bombs, she settled onto the seabed. She was stricken from the navy list, and subsequently raised and scrapped after the end of the war.<ref name=":0" />

Initially, Tone and her sistership Chikuma were laid down as Mogami-class cruisers. However, as design flaws with early Mogami-class vessels became apparent and Japan abandoning the London Naval Agreement, the decision was made to change the design of these two ships and create a separate class from them. As a result, Tone-class cruisers resembled the general design of the Mogami-class, but had all their gun turrets placed on the forecastle while also featuring a heavier emphasis on seaplane operations, having their entire aft deck space dedicated to it.

Tone was completed in 1938 and joined the ranks of the IJN in November that year. Upon completion, Tone and her sistership formed the 8th Cruiser Division, operating together as part of this unit for the majority of their service careers during the upcoming conflict. Their first combat mission was none other than participating in the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, with their floatplanes acting as scouts for the upcoming attack.

Subsequently, Tone and her sistership took part in almost all significant battles of the Pacific Theatre, being involved in the invasion of Wake Island, the Battle of Midway, the Battle of Guadalcanal, the Battle of the Philippine Sea and many others. Towards the end of the war, Tone underwent several refits, substantially bolstering her AA firepower and radar equipment with each drydock visit.

While Chikuma was already lost in October 1944 as part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Tone continued serving on until the very end of the war, being sunk at Kure harbor in July 1945 following a major allied air raid on the Japanese naval base. The ship's wreck was subsequently dismantled in the immediate postwar years and sold for scrap.
