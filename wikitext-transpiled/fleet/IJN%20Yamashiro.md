'''Yamashiro''' (山城) was the second ship of the [[Fuso (Family)|Fusō-class]] battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, laid down in November 1913 and commissioned in March 1917. Throughout the interwar period, she underwent several modernisations, enhancing her armament, armour, and superstructure, including the enlargement of her distinctive pagoda-style mast. Despite these upgrades, Yamashiro was considered inferior to newer battleships, limiting her active deployment. During World War II, she served mainly as a training ship and participated in troop transport missions until October 1944, when she became the flagship of Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura's Southern Force. In the Battle of Leyte Gulf, specifically the Battle of Surigao Strait, Yamashiro was sunk after an engagement where she was focused by multiple US battleships, marking the last battleship-versus-battleship combat in naval history.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank Japanese battleship introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]], with an additional pre-order which opened on 18 October 2023, granting a unique title - "''Oni no Yamashiro''" - and a unique Kyoto Prefecture flag. These bonuses have not been obtainable since 31 October 2023, when the update was released and pre-orders closed. Yamashiro has six turrets with twin 356 mm cannons, which can fire an extremely powerful broadside of twelve 356 mm shells, something that no other vessel can match in her BR. Similarly, her secondary casemate guns are able to deal with destroyers and light cruisers, although they suffer from very limited accuracy. Finally, her anti-air defences and torpedoes are mostly symbolic, offering limited effectiveness. Compared to her [[IJN Fuso|tech-tree equivalent]], she trades a lower BR for worse survivability, less accurate secondaries, and a much worse anti-air/anti-boat capability.

Yamashiro was the second vessel of the [[Fuso (Family)|Fusō-class]] battleships, laid down on 20 November 1913 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and launched on 3 November 1915. Her construction was delayed due to budgetary constraints. During this period, her sister ship [[IJN Fuso|Fusō]] was completed and entered service. Criticisms of Fusō's design, particularly issues related to the protection scheme and the placement of rangefinders, prompted modifications to Yamashiro's design during her construction.

As a result of these alterations, Yamashiro differed significantly from Fusō despite starting as identical twins. The most noticeable difference was in the design of the superstructure: Yamashiro's bridge had a straighter, more forward-leaning appearance compared to Fusō's pagoda-style superstructure. Additionally, the orientation of the third turret was modified, with Yamashiro's turret facing aft while Fusō's faced forward, allowing for a better design of the internal machinery and ammunition-handling spaces. During the interwar period she served in various capacities, including as a training vessel, and underwent a number of refits, with the largest modernisation lasting from December 1930 to February 1935, including upgrades to her main, secondary, and anti-air guns, complete replacement of the machinery, adding torpedo bulges, and extending the length of the entire vessel by nearly 8 metres.

She took part in the beginning of the Second World War in the Pacific, as part of Battleship Division 2 during the attack on Pearl Harbor (Operation Z), but did not see combat. Following that, Yamashiro served largely as a training vessel during the later stages of the conflict. In 1942 she took part in the Battle of Midway (Operation Mi), but was kept away from combat. She continued her service as a training vessel and received a few minor refits during that period, most notably to the radars and fire control systems as well as increased anti-air complement. Finally, in October 1944 she became the flagship of Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura's force during the Battle of Leyte Gulf (Operation Shō-1-Go). On 25 October 1944, Yamashiro participated in the Battle of Surigao Strait, where she was sunk by United States naval forces, marking one of the last battleship-versus-battleship engagements in history. The ship was lost with most of her crew, including Nishimura himself. In December 2017, the wreck of Yamashiro was discovered in the Surigao Strait by a research team led by Paul Allen.
