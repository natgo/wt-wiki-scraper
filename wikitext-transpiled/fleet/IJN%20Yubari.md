== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (夕張, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Yūbari River) is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

The {{PAGENAME}} was built between 1922 and 1923 as an experimental test bed for various new innovations made by the Imperial Japanese Navy, such as weight-saving design and the then state-of-the-art Kampon boilers. As a result, the Yubari ended up being something between a very heavy destroyer and a very light cruiser.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Yubari is a very small cruiser, being only slightly longer and heavier than the [[IJN Akizuki|Akizuki]] at 138.9 metres in length and 4,450 tons of displacement. When combined with her decent mobility, she can be somewhat harder to hit at range.

Being such a small and very light cruiser also means that the Yubari doesn't have much protection. Her armour profile is roughly the same as the [[IJN Kuma|Kuma]] with smaller shell rooms, which means it's very poorly protected against any other cruisers and even destroyers at closer range. Yubari's fatal weak spot is her rear ammunition storage that sits above the waterline and is very easy to hit and detonate.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Yūbari offers speeds closer to destroyers over light cruisers at the cost of still getting a rather far large fleet spawn. Her speed and small figure allow her to dodge shells with more ease compared to a regular-sized cruiser.

{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|140 mm/50 3rd Year Type (140 mm)}}

The armament of the Yūbari is rather lacklustre for a cruiser, but it should be kept in mind that she's built as a testbed and plays closer to a destroyer rather than a cruiser with her size, speed and fewer (but larger) guns compared to regular destroyers. Her 4 x 140 mm cannons come in 2 dual-mount turrets in the front and back of the ship, coordinating the [[120 mm/45 10th year type (120 mm)|120 mm/45]] in main and auxiliary calibre shooting with one button allows the captain to output quite the forward firepower, leaving your target size minimal, while still dishing out considerable damage against destroyers and light cruisers.

Broadsiding to use the back turret offers more damage output but makes the ship a larger target so keep that in mind. The armour should suffice against weaker destroyers, but facing heavy-end destroyers and other cruisers, it's ill-advised.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|120 mm/45 10th year type (120 mm)}}

As mentioned with the primary, the auxiliary calibre should be fired in unison with the primary guns as it doesn't offer too much on its own. The 120 mm is mounted in a single mount turret as the most forward turret 1 level below the forward primary.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|25 mm/60 Type 96 (25 mm)}}

Having 25 x 25 mm Type 96s, Yūbari offers a decent amount of close anti-air cover for herself and nearby vessels, causing havoc among small patrol boats and shredding them within ~2 km.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 8 No.2 (610 mm)}}

Carrying 2 torpedo launchers with 2 tubes each, Yūbari offers 4 torpedoes on the ready with 4 more on reserve ready for reloading. The turrets are a rather old model and are slow to traverse.

The Type 8s aren't the top-of-the-line [[Type 93 Model 3 (610 mm)|Type 93 ''Long Lance'']] torpedoes but still offer the same bang and range without the speed.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Small size (comparable to some destroyers) makes her harder to target
* Sufficient armaments and armour to take on any destroyers at range
* Good AA armament

'''Cons:'''

* Terrible survivability against other cruisers
* Only 4 main guns, very poor damage output against cruisers
* Carries only 8 torpedoes, only 4 can be launched before reloading
* Average top speed and mobility
* Rear ammo racks sit above the waterline and are thus prone to detonation
* Outclassed by almost every cruiser she will face
* Extremely short SAP fuse delay makes damaging enemy ships' internal modules difficult

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Imperial Japanese Navy authorized the construction of the Yubari class during the First World War as part of the 8-4 Fleet Construction Program.  Due to budgetary constraints, the ship did not start construction until 1922. Like many pre-war Japanese vessels, it sought to put as much weaponry as possible on a limited size hull. It was designed to have the hitting power of a 5,500-ton class cruiser in a 4,500-ton package.  While in many cases, this resulted in overweight, top-heavy and unseaworthy boats, the Yubari class accomplished this using an intelligent application of structural armour. <ref>Stille, M., 2012, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45, Osprey Publishing</ref>
