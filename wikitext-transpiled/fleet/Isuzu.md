== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (いすず, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Isuzu River) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese frigate {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|3 inch Mk.33 (76 mm)}}

Isuzu carries four 3-inch Mk.33 automatic cannons in twin installation. The turrets are placed at the front and back of the ship and can effectively cover your vessel from all sides. HE shells can take care of unarmoured targets especially small boats which can be destroyed within a few shots. For armoured targets and destroyers, you can choose APHE shells but you still have to keep in mind that it is a 76 mm multi-purpose cannon. HE-VT shells are good for use in AA roles as there is not any secondary armament you can rely on.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->

{{main|Type 54 model 3 (533 mm)|Mk.6 mortar depth charge|Mark 108 Weapon alfa}}

As one of the special armaments, this ship carries Mark 108 Weapon alfa without any upgrades. This is an anti-submarine rocket, but in-game you can only use it for close-range combat against ships. It shoots RUR-4 rockets that have a speed of 306 km/h and carries 113 kg of TNT, which is equal to small torpedoes. The biggest disadvantage is the range, which is only 800 m especially, combined with the fact that fast boats can easily dodge these rockets. Blindspot in front of the ship (thanks to the main armament turret) makes this weapon very situational.

After unlocking the "Bomb mortar" upgrade, you can equip 2 x Mk. 6 depth charges which are projected from mortars. These weapons have an extremely limited range (only a few hundred metres off each side of the ship) and would only be used during a close-in brawl. Keep in mind that the depth charges do take a few seconds to fly through the air and sink before they detonate, so be aware of timing their firing. Each Mk. 6 depth charge has an explosive charge of 136 kg TNT, which will obliterate any small craft and deal significant damage to a larger ship.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Isuzu has upgraded firepower from its in-game predecessor [[Chikugo]] but it shares the same imperfections of not very long-range and small calibre compared to opponents you will meet. That means you should stick to the same tactics that work for Chikugo, such as not attempting to battle against long-range destroyers and rather focusing on boats and sub-chasers. You should not take this ship into the late game as there isn't any anti-air armament and you will be easy prey for bombers that can overwhelm you if coming from different directions.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Radar
* Main guns can engage variety of targets
* Guns have high rate of fire
* Mark 108 missiles are effective against close targets

'''Cons:'''

* Guns overheat quickly
* No secondary or anti-aircraft armament
* Slow compared to destroyers
* Destroyer spawn

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== [[wt:en/news/6516-development-isuzu-hard-hitting-frigate-en|Devblog]] ===
During the late 1950's, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force (JMSDF) was planning on expanding their destroyer fleet with a number of new ships intended to complement the recently modernized destroyers leased from the US Navy. However, these plans were revised shortly afterwards due to the JMSDF realizing that their frigates in service at the time, as well as being older leased US vessels, were starting to show their age and were getting ever closer to their planned retirement, scheduled for the early 1960's.

As a result, development of a new frigate began in the late 1950's, eventually resulting in the creation of the Isuzu-class. The first two ships of the class, Isuzu and Mogami, were laid down in April and August of 1960, respectively, while the remaining two ships, Kitakami and Ōi, were both laid down in June of 1962.

The first batch of ships entered service with the JMSDF in 1961, with the other half being commissioned in 1964. Ships of the Isuzu-class served faithfully with the JMSDF until they were decommissioned in the early 1990's, also serving as a base for the development of its successor design - the Chikugo-class - shortly after their introduction.
