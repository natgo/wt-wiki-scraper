== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (あやなみ, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Twilled Waves) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese frigate {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

Technically a destroyer, JDS Ayanami's light armament leads it to be classified as a frigate in-game and be put in the Coastal tree. Compared to the preceding Isuzu, Ayanami is better in every way, having another pair of dual-purpose 76 mm guns, double the number of torpedoes, and is faster and has more crew. The 6 dual-purpose guns and modern FCS allows it to destroy aircraft and fight MTBs and other frigates effectively. Unfortunately, it can meet large destroyer leaders and light cruisers like [[USS Somers]] or [[HMS Dido]], which far outclass Ayanami in firepower and have the survivability and size to mostly ignore its guns. Ayanami can try to use its good accuracy and high rate of fire to target the guns of the larger ships, and then escape with smoke or close the distance and target them with torpedoes and depth charges.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* 6 guns with HE-VT provides excellent anti-air ability
* High rate of fire shreds smaller vessels
* Modern FCS and radar gives the guns very high accuracy and range update time
* Radar detects aircraft from a long distance away, allows the player to preemptively switch to HE-VT shells

'''Cons:'''
* Meets much larger ships with the firepower to easily destroy it
* ASW torpedoes are weaker than ones found on destroyers
* No secondary weapons, means it has to manually switch to HE-VT shells to fight aircraft
