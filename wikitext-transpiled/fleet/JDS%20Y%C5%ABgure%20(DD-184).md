== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''Ariake-class, JDS Yūgure (DD-184), 1960''' (ゆうぐれ, [[Abbreviations#.28JP.29_Naval|namesake]]: Twilight), formerly '''USS Richard P. Leary (DD-664)''', was a [[Fletcher (Family)|Fletcher-class]] destroyer of the US Navy. She was loaned to Japan in 1959 along with a sister ship (''JDS Ariake (DD-183)'', formerly ''USS Heywood L. Edwards (DD-663)''), and underwent modifications to serve as a training and experimental vessel. The Yūgure participated in mine warfare until 1974, when she was decommissioned and returned to the US Navy. She was scrapped in 1976 together with her sister.

She was introduced during [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7107-event-future-technology-en|Future Technology]] event. Yūgure is a stripped-down [[Fletcher (DD-445)]] that sacrifices one 5-inch gun, torpedoes, and 20 mm cannons for additional 40 mm twin mounts. This gives her a reduced battle rating and allows her to face less powerful opponents more often. The remaining 5-inch guns have a high fire rate and damage output that can destroy older destroyers easily, and the 40 mm cannons can deal with small patrol boats effectively.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

Prior to being loaned to the JMSDF, Yūgure was known as the USS Richard P. Leary (DD-664) and was one of many Fletcher-class destroyers built for the USN during WWII. Commissioned in 1944, the ship took part in some of the last major operations in the Pacific theatre before being decommissioned and put into reserve in 1946.

In 1959, USS Richard P. Leary as well as another Fletcher destroyer were loaned to the JMSDF and was renamed to Yūgure. In Japanese service, the destroyer was modified several times to better fit the anti-submarine warfare and training ship roles. Yūgure would end up serving with the Japanese Navy until 1974 before the ship was returned to the U.S. and ultimately sold for scrap in 1976.
