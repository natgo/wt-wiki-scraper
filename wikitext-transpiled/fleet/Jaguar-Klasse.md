== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
A Jaguar-Klasse (140) could be compared to the Jaguar, which is part of the Panthera onca family. The Jaguar-Klasse (140) is sleek low profile ship, offers high agility, fast speeds with speeds up to 80 km/h and very deadly, by itself. Just like a Jaguar (Panthera onca) in real life.
It features a pair of deadly rapid-firing 40 mm autocannons, placed on the bow and stern. These offer an astonishing reload time of up to 0.25 Seconds. Additionally, the Jaguar-Klasse (140), has been installed with four 533 mm G7a Torpedo tubes, which are able to sink the mightiest ships in the game.
A Jaguar-Klasse (140) Does not contain any armour plates on the hull or on the super-structure. However, around its 40 mm cannons, it has 9.52 mm hardened armour installed.

This means the ship is very exposed to HE and AP rounds. The ship carries 4,000 rounds of ammo & 4 torpedoes. Ammo is stored below decks, in places: in front of the ship super-structure and at the rear of the ship. A single well-placed shot in either of these locations, with a large HE round, will denote these and cause the ship to explode, sending the crew to Davy Jones locker!

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
In arcade mode this ship offers an excellent speed of 111 km/h, In Realist & Simulator modes it offers a top speed of 80 km/h, its full speed can be reached from 0 to 80 km/h in a blistering time of 23.6 seconds. The handling of this vessel in combat, is great, it is able to dodge and dance enemy torpedoes & bombs. It is also able to offer great manoeuvrability, in being able to change course without warning, putting enemy range finders to shame.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|40 mm/70 MEL58 (40 mm)}}

The cannons are placed on the stern and bow of the ship, each turret has a single MEL58 autocannon with 2,000 rounds of ammo per gun, with each clip having 8 rounds. The placement of the cannons offer great coverage of the ship. The super-structure does not restrict the rearview, which allows for the rear and flanks to be checked with great ease.

*Top reloading speed is 0.25 seconds, with a crew qualification of an ace status.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|G7a (533 mm)}}

The G7a torpedoes do not need to be researched, they are included. However, the tubes are placed angled to the ship. When firing the torpedoes, the course of the ship must be changed to the direction in which they are intended.  Unlike other torpedo boats, where the tubes are installed in the direction of the stern which allows for the torpedoes to run in a straight line, without having to change course.

The G7a torpedoes offer great speed and hitting power for this rank.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Load the ship with AP or universal rounds, it's important to note that this ship cannot engage well at long distance anything over 3,000 m should not be engaged with the cannons. The ideal range for enemy ships to be engaged at is under 2,500 m, where it is possible for each round to be traced, tracked and adjusted to hit the enemy.

In short, sneak up on targets, do not give away the position of the ship, by firing the guns too early.  Or find somewhere concealed, just await for them to sail pass at full steam, then come out full gun's blazing strafing their hull, from stern to bow, using AP or universal rounds in a few runs the enemy ship will soon be ablaze and sinking.

Enemy destroyers will often be focused & locked on other destroyers or larger prey. However, sometimes they will notice, take evasion by heading in the splash of their shell's, to avoid the shell's hitting the ship. Head into them, then turn suddenly and repeat until you are within torpedo range.
Additionally, if the enemy destroyer is very close within 1,500 m, Target their main and secondary weapons with the 40 mm cannons to knock them out and get as close as possible before releasing the torpedoes. One good hit, ideally to stern or bow, will result with the enemy ship sinking!

'''Biggest threats''' - The [[Pr. 206]], [[Pr.206-M]], [[Fairmile D (697)]] pose one of the biggest threat to this ship.  These ships offer incredible manoeuvrability, speed & firepower.  Which are most likely to be encountered in battle alongside destroyers.

'''Air threats:''' - Enemy aircraft pose an extinction-level event for this ship, if the aircraft lines up and opens fire. It will most likely hit your ammo storage areas, below the decks resulting in the ship exploding faster than the meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs.
However, as long as the sky is observed and enemy aircraft are detected in time, wait until they are in the dive and just before they open fire load AP and shoot engine block, it will knock the enemy fighter out. If it is a bomber or attacker aim for the wings and flight deck, a few well-placed rounds will terminate them in mid-air.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==
<!-- Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History) and add a link to it here using the main template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <ref></ref>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <references />. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under === In-game description ===, also if applicable). -->
The Type 140, Jaguar-Klasse was a class of fast attack craft developed for the German navy following the end of the Second World War as a development of the German E-boats of WWII. The boats featured substantial armament compared to wartime designs, including new 40 mm Bofors guns and 533 mm torpedo tubes. In total, twenty Jaguar-class boats were built starting in 1957; they were all retired by 1974 and either scrapped or sold to foreign navies.

The Jaguar class was developed by the Lürssen shipyard in Germany as ''Schnellboot'' ''55'', and designed to be highly-capable small surface combatants. The ships displaced 210 tons full load and were 42 m long. Powered by four diesel engines, the ships were capable of reaching 42 knots (78 km/h) max, or 39 knots (72 km/h) sustained. The ships were armed with two 40 mm Bofors L/70 guns with a total of 3168 rounds of ammunition, as well as four 533 mm torpedo tubes. The ship's aft torpedo tubes could be replaced with minelaying equipment, and the ships were capable of carrying depth charges. Each ship's complement consisted of 39 officers and men.

In total, twenty Jaguar-class vessels were constructed between 1957 and 1960, all named after predatory animals. Most ships served in the German navy until 1975-76, when they were retired. Following their retirement, most Jaguar-class ships were sold to the Turkish navy, while some others were scrapped or cannibalized for spare parts. As well, several vessels were converted into private yachts. The Jaguar class lent its design to the Seeadler subclass of 10 vessels, which differed only in the type of engine. Both classes were succeeded by the [[Albatros]]-class fast attack craft, which was capable of carrying Exocet anti-ship missiles.
