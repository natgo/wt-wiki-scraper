== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]] as a reward during the 2019 [[wt:en/news/6521-special-operation-f-r-o-s-t-en|"Operation F.R.O.S.T"]] event.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
With a construction made of steel and a crew of 120 sailors, the survivability of the vessel is normal, but not great. The ship may resist one or two shots from a Destroyer, but will quickly be sunk if you do not do anything to evade fire.

'''Armour type:'''

* Antifragmentation armour

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|SK C/32 (105 mm)}}

Instead of using 12.7 cm cannons like its sister ships, the Jaguar uses 10.5 cm cannons. While being smaller than the guns of its contemporaries, they can still perform effectively with a lower reload speed. They offer a little more forgiveness to the player, while often offering less to the target. The damage dealt by the HE round with the base fuse, along with its reload, allows the player to whittle away at the target, and with a little aiming, can render the target completely defenceless.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2 cm/65 C/30 (20 mm)}}

The ship is equipped with two 20 mm guns as secondary armament. This guns can provide a little protection against low-flying aircraft or the smaller torpedo boats. It's difficult to take down an aircraft, but the rate of fire and the standard belt can make planes opt to target less defended vessels. Against torpedo boats they are not a great help, but they can deter smaller boats from getting close enough to deploy their torpedoes accurately.

Two triple G7a torpedo launch tubes are mounted on the ship. The G7a is very effective against any opponents the Leopard might have to face at its BR.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".''

'''Pros:'''

* Features quick-firing and accurate 10.5 cm cannons
* G7a torpedoes can knock out any ships at this BR with a few hits
* Good mobility and agility

'''Cons:'''

* Poor survivability
* Low crew count
* Lacklustre secondary armaments

[[File:Type 1924 Jaguar 1934-1935.jpg|thumb|520x520px|Jaguar at sea, 1934–1935]]
The Type 1924 "Jaguar" was a heavy torpedo boat of the six-ship "Type 24" class. Built for the newly-established German Navy in the 1920s, the ships were extremely heavily-armed for a ship of their size. She sailed on several non-intervention patrols for the German Navy during the Spanish Civil War, and laid many minefields during the Second World War. By the start of 1942, '''Jaguar''' was one of two remaining ships of the class still afloat; she served until the D-Day landings, where she was sunk by allied bombers while in port at Le Havre.

=== Design and development ===
The "Type 24" class of 1924 were a class of six heavy torpedo boats built for the German navy. Despite them being extremely heavily armed and close to destroyer-size, they were classified as torpedo boats by the German navy. In War Thunder, these vessels are classified as destroyers. The ships displaced 1,300 tons full load and could make a top speed of 34 knots (63 km/h). They had a crew of 129 crew members, which was relatively small for a destroyer but large for a torpedo boat. Jaguar carried three 10.5 cm (4 inch) naval guns, as well as six 533 mm torpedo tubes. Later on, she received four 2 cm Flakvierling anti-aircraft guns for air defence. Jaguar was the last ship of her class to be laid down, in May 1927 at Wilhelmshaven. Following her completion, she was commissioned in August 1929.

=== Operational history ===
After her commissioning, Jaguar was commissioned into the 3rd Torpedo Boat flotilla along with her sister ships. During the late 1930s, she made several non-intervention patrols in the seas off of Spain due to the Spanish Civil War. At the start of the Second World War, Jaguar made numerous anti-contraband patrols with her sister ships, then sailed towards Norway to provide support for the German Norwegian campaign. During this time, she escorted the heavily-damaged pocket battleship Lutzow after she was torpedoed, as well as the Scharnhorst. She also participated in extensive mine-laying duties, laying mines in the North Sea and off of Dover (in the United Kingdom).

In February 1941, Jaguar escorted the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to the French port of Brest after their North Atlantic raid, and soon after escorted them back out on the Channel Dash. She later the battlecruisers, along with the battleship Tirpitz, on their voyages between various Norwegian fjords and inlets. In June 1943, Jaguar recommenced her usual role, and laid more mines in the North Sea. In early 1944, Jaguar laid more mines in the English Channel; at this point, she was based at the port of Le Havre. However, it was there that she met her final fate. In June 1944, shortly after the D-Day landings, RAF bombers bombed Le Havre with the goal of destroying all German ships there. Jaguar, along with her sole remaining sister ship, Falke, were both sunk by bombs.
