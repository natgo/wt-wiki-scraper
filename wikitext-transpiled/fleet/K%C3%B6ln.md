== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Köln features decent all around armour with a belt of 50 mm steel covering the most of the ship except the very front and rear, as well as a 10 mm turtleback armour behind it, giving it a slightly better internal protection in close to medium ranges, additionally the bulkheads measure 70 mm of armour. The turrets are a maximum of 30 mm on the front, as are the barbettes, so knockouts of turrets and ammo elevators are common.

The bridge is covered in 100 mm of cemented armour, giving it enough protection from large calibre HE rounds, but nothing more since even destroyer grade SAP rounds can easily punch right through it, making your ship uncontrollable.

The ammo storage, although decently protected by the belt, turtle back and barbette armour, should never be exposed broadside, as all cruisers can penetrate it even from longer ranges. The crew count however, with 820 men, is quite high for a ship this size and helps keeping it afloat and combat ready.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The Köln has a pretty average speed for a light cruiser:

* A top speed of 70 km/h in AB and 60 km/h in RB.
* A top reverse speed of 25 km/h in AB and 22 km/h in RB.

As for the manoeuvrability, since it is a cruiser it is quite sluggish, but this is to be expected, therefore narrow turns and fast dodging of torpedoes is not possible.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
[[File:Köln 150mm88mm.jpg|thumb|400x400px|The placement of the 150 mm (red) and 88 mm (yellow) turrets.]]
{{main|15 cm/60 SK C/25 (150 mm)}}

The primary armament consists of nine 15 cm/60 SK C/25 cannons mounted in three triple turrets, one central in the front, and two in the rear, slightly off-centre to the left and to the right. These cannons come with a maximum rate of fire of 8 shots per minute and can fire HE, SAPBC, APCBC and time-fused HE shells. These shells are the same as on the [[Emden]] so most captains will be familiar with these:

* HE: mostly useful against destroyers

* SAPBC: can also be utilized against destroyers and for lightly armoured cruisers such as [[USS Trenton]], [[IJN Agano]], [[USS Portland]].

* APCBC: for more heavily armoured cruisers like [[Admiral Hipper]], [[USS Brooklyn]] and [[IJN Mogami]]. It should be noted however that the APCBC is only useful at medium ranges, everything over 8,000 m which isn't broadside is very difficult to damage.

Their muzzle velocity is uniform between the HE and APCBC rounds with a quick 960 m/s and between the HE-TF and SAPBC rounds with 835 m/s, therefore slightly easier to aim than other contemporary cruisers.

Important to mention is that the rear turrets are a full 360° traversable, giving the Köln the ability to focus at least two turrets at a target at all times.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|8.8 cm/76 SK C/32 (88 mm)}}

Secondary weapons are composed of a total of three twin-mounted 8.8 cm anti-air cannons with a maximum fire rate of 20 shots per minute. Shells available are HE shells for destroyer and PT boat fights as well as time-fused HE shells which are useful for long range anti-aircraft fire.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
[[File:Köln 37mm20mm.jpg|thumb|400x400px|The location of the 37 mm (green) and 20 mm (blue) emplacements.]]
{{main|SK C/30 (37 mm)|2 cm/65 C/30 (20 mm)}}

Anti-air defences are composed of four 3.7 cm twin mountings with a fire rate of 30 rounds per seconds, but only firing HE shells, therefore only providing protection from slow moving planes like bombers, and four 20 mm autocannons in single mountings, generally useful for close range anti-air defence, but considering the low number of emplacements for such a large ship, not sufficient in most cases.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|G7a (533 mm)}}

The Köln has the ability to deploy up to twelve standard G7a torpedoes in four triple mounts, two of them mounted per side. Limited use for screening of choke points and narrow water straits, but typically the range at which cruisers slug it out is too great to make use of them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Köln is a fun all round light cruiser with usable armour, a good amount of guns, decent fire rate and excellent firing angles. The most important aspect with this ship is to always angle, never ever show your broadside, as this gives enemies an easy shot for your rear ammo racks. By angling, this chance is minimized, albeit not fully avoidable.

Even though the turrets move relatively slowly, this disadvantage is negated by the fully traversable rear turrets, giving the Köln the ability to switch directions easily from one side to the other without losing most of its firepower. However, the firing angles when facing to starboard are better by a few degrees than to port, due to the non-central placement of the X and Y turret. Early light cruisers can be engaged by around 8,000 – 10,000 m, whereas more heavily armed and armoured ships like the Admiral Hipper and USS Brooklyn can effectively be dealt with when they face full broadside to you, or by closing the distance to around 5,000 – 6,000 m.

Lastly, you should always be aware that you are not the top dog in most cases, so careful aiming and smart decision-making is important, or your ship will succumb to the firepower of more powerful ships.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent firing angles

KMS Köln was laid down in August 1926 in Wilhelmshaven as the third and final ship of the Königsberg-class of German light cruisers. Köln was ordered as a replacement for the old SMS Arcona light cruiser and was launched in May 1928, before being commissioned into service in January 1930. Her first years of service, KMS Köln spent undergoing various sea trials and acted as a training ship. In late 1932 however, the warship departed Germany for her first world cruise, stopping in numerous ports across the globe in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. Prior to the outbreak of WW2, KMS Köln took part in non-intervention patrols around the Iberian Peninsula during the Spanish Civil War. Upon completing her patrol missions, KMS Köln returned to the waters of the North Sea in order to conduct fishery protection. During WW2, KMS Köln primarily operated in the waters of the North and Baltic Seas, whilst occasionally taking part in operations in the Atlantic. Most notably, KMS Köln took part in Operation Weserübung in 1940 - the German Invasion of Norway. During this operation, both of her two sister ships were lost in combat, whilst Köln remained undamaged. Throughout the remainder of WW2, KMS Köln primarily took part in operations in the North Sea, mostly in Norwegian waters, running convoy interdiction and minelaying. In December 1944, KMS Köln suffered damage to her propulsion system caused by several near misses inflicted by allied bombers, close to Oslofjord. The damage forced her to return for repairs to Germany, where she eventually ended up in Wilhelmshaven again. There, an allied air raid damaged Köln further and led her to sink on an even keel. Only partially sunk and with the guns still operational, she was used as an artillery platform to help defend the city before the war ended. Although partially dismantled after the war, Köln was raised in 1956 and scuttled soon afterwards.
