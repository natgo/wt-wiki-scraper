== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Fidonisy-class destroyer built for Imperial Russian Navy. The Fidonisy-class was improvement of previous Derzky-class destroyers. Kerch was laid down on 29th October 1915 and comissioned on 27<sup>th</sup> June 1917. After the Russian revolution, she joined the Bolsheviks and conducted several shore bombardments along the Crimea. On 29<sup>th</sup> April 1918, she sailed to Novorossiysk to avoid capture by advancing German forces. On 18<sup>th</sup> June, she scuttled Imperatritsa Mariya-class battleship Svobodnaya Rossiya and Kerch´s sister, Fidonisy to avoid being handed over to Germans as a result of Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Kerch herself was then scuttled for same reason off the harbour entrance at Tuapse. In 1929 the Soviets tried to refloat her, but the wreck broke apart. In 1932 they raised her engine room and used them as source of energy in the Tuapse power plant.

Kerch was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]] as a GE premium. As a destroyer from the Imperial era, Kerch is very similar to the reserve [[Frunze]], mainly differing in its secondary weapons, where it has a somewhat more usable secondary battery but far worse torpedoes.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
As with other destroyers, Kerch is barely armoured. It mainly relies on its relatively small size and crew count to survive.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The mobility of the destroyer Kerch is not that good compared to its contemporaries, but it's quite manoeuvrable.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Pattern 1911 (102 mm)}}

Kerch has 4 x 102 mm cannons as the main weapon. These guns have decent firepower and fire rate but are far from the best brawling weapons. The greatest advantage of these guns is the high accuracy which they have. As such, Kerch should be played as a sniper destroyer more so than a close-range brawler. The accuracy of these guns at long range far surpasses the other equivalent destroyers of other nations and can be used to shell enemies from far range with impunity from more inaccurate enemy fire.

Kerch also has the option of loading a unique shrapnel shell. While it is quite effective against any destroyer it might face due to increased fragmentation damage, it cannot set the enemy on fire (thus near useless against any destroyers that utilise anti-fragmentation armour), as well as cannot hull break any lightly-armoured PT boats (its greatest threats) it hits due to the shell over-penetrating and dealing little to no damage at all.

Another point worth mentioning is the fact that the arrangement of the guns is not exactly the best, with a single gun at the front and the 3 others all at the back. This means that you can only use a single gun against a target directly in front of you.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2pdr QF Mk.IIc (40 mm)}}

The biggest difference between Kerch and the Frunze is that it's using two 40 mm Pom-Pom autocannons instead of a manually loaded 76 mm and 45 mm as secondary armaments. Despite only featured two single mounts at the aft and stern, these guns are quite reliable for AA defence due to wide coverage, and it's able to fend off PT boats at close distance.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Maxim (7.62 mm)}}

Anti-air armaments of Kerch consisted of two severely outdated 7.62 mm Maxim machine guns that are pretty much useless except for spooking inbound aircraft to dodge relatively harmless shots.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Pattern 1910 (450 mm)}}

Although Kerch has three more torpedo tubes than the Frunze, it utilizes incredibly weak torpedoes with only 100 kg of explosive (less than half of Frunze's). This means it often requires more than one hit to destroy enemy ships. Other than that, its range is also awfully short at only 3 km, so it cannot attack enemy ships other than at near point blank range. Interestingly it also has two spare torpedoes, a rarity in Russian vessels.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Main cannons are very accurate
* Good crew count for reserve ship, can soak up a little more damage than some other reserves
* Easy to control and manoeuvrable
* Small superstructure makes it harder to hit
* Pom-Pom autocannons are useful for fending off aircraft and boats

'''Cons:'''

* Cannons are mostly unprotected, even small-calibre machine guns can easily take them out
* No access to contact-fuze HE shells, instead has a shrapnel shell that cannot set ships on fire
* Horrible torpedoes with tiny warhead and short range
* AA machine guns are mostly useless
* Slow reserve destroyer

Kerch was a Fidonisy-class destroyer laid down in 1915 for the Imperial Russian Navy. The class was the third series of the Novik-type ships. Kerch was only completed in 1917 and commissioned in the Black Sea Fleet, but took little part in the First World War, as only months later the Russian Civil War broke out. Kerch joined the Bolsheviks, and supported them in their attempt to control Crimea by bombarding White Russian forces. As the invading Germans advanced into Ukraine, Kerch retreated to Novorossiysk and was later scuttled to prevent it from being turned to the Germans after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In 1929, the Soviet Navy attempted to raise the ship, but it broke apart and only the midship was salvaged, with its engines used in a power station at Tuapse.
