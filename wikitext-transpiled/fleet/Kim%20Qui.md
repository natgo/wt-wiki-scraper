== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The USS PGM-59, commissioned in RVNN (Republic of Vietnam Navy; HQVNCH) as the HQ-605 Kim Qui (Vietnamese Chu Nom: 金龜(or 龟); Golden Turtle) was a variant of the PGM-39 class gunboat built in US which some of them were supplied to allied countries during the Cold War. The ship was built in Tacoma, WA in 1963 and was then transferred to RVNN; due to the lack of records both in Vietnam and USN, the ship is currently lost in history.

Although classified as a gunboat and only has just over 100 ton displacement, the armaments onboard packs enough punch at its tier in broadsides thanks to its 40 mm Bofors and twin 20 mm cannons onboard; but do remember that the ship itself is very prone to be devastated by main cannons by enemies' gunships with higher caliber HE shells, as well as Kim Qui's turtle-like speed will hinder its combat maneuverability and flexibility to retreat from heated battlefield.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
As a small and agile motor gun boat, the Kim Qui does not have significant armour protection. Its hull is constructed of 8 mm steel, while the superstructure is made of 4 mm steel. This level of protection offers little resistance to incoming fire and the vessel's survivability is therefore largely dependent on its speed and manoeuvrability.

The Kim Qui is divided into four sections, including the bow, midsection, engine room, and stern. Each section has its own health pool and can be individually damaged or destroyed. The vessel has a total displacement of 118 tons and is crewed by 17 sailors.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Powered by 2 Mercedes Benz MB820, Kim Qui could travel up to 32 km/h; not only this name fits its literal translation "golden turtle", this also means the ship will neither be the first to reach capture zones nor heated combat zones. This speed for gunboat is even slower than gunboats from other nations with even more firepower, meaning any operations at open waters is extremely lethal.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)}}

The only main weapon on Kim Qui is a 40mm Bofors L/56 on Mark 3 mount located on the front deck; 40 mm Bofors are well known to players due to its reliable, sustained volley of fire and its devastating firepower against light targets. Thanks to its high penetration AP shells, sometimes even larger ships might fall victim to the gun or at least having many components disabled by the gun. But do remember that this is the only main weapon on the ship, keep the turret operable and its crew alive at all cost- the remaining Oerlikon 20 mm cannons and AN/M2 are nowhere as effective as the 40 mm gun.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

Aside from a Bofors, Kim Qui is also equipped with 2 pairs of 20 mm/70 Oerlikon autocannons against oncoming aircrafts or attack boats at rear deck and superstructure; while the reload time is short enough and having generous ammo pool, the gun crew is exposed and prone to to both gunfire or shrapnel from HE shells.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

Although it might already had sufficient dual-purpose guns on the boat, Kim Qui still has 2 AN/M2 .50 cal machine gun at its disposal on the sides of the superstructure. It could serve as supplementary firepower to the Oerlikons; but just like the autocannons, be extremely careful to gunfire and shrapnel.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Do not be fooled by the translation of the name Kim Qui- golden turtle, the name might sound like something durable to enemy gunfire; but at only 8 mm of steel for the hull and 4 mm for superstructure, it might have better durability than wooden hull boats as there are few boats at its tier to have full-steel protection, but do not expect it can handle boats with extensive autocannon mounts or those have higher caliber cannons like 76 mm/3" guns; there are already gun boats at its tier to have equipped with T-34/85 turret or even Flak 38 88 mm cannon, let alone destroyer escorts even more artillery fire. To make matter worse, the overall speed is rather low as well at mere 27 km/h stock; attack boats at its tier can travel up to twice to its speed and they are very likely equipped with autocannons with high rate of fire, a very bad news for the 17 crews onboard as well as these can tear down the ship in seconds.

The ship itself could be very challenging to handle, but at least there are Bofors and a few twin Oerlikon 20 mm at disposal; it might sound nowhere close to boats with quad mount autocannons or more advanced Cold-War autocannons, Kim Qui would still have the chance to taking out attack boats with the armaments onboard, the rate of fire will make sure they would at least have a very bad day. With AP belts selected, chances are it would face escort ships at coastal waters and this give it some firepower to harass enemies; do make sure to find covers from time to time. Another suggested way to increase its survivability is using only the Bofors at the frontal arc and have covers ready, it is better to launch a sudden strike upon enemies that sailing out straight way and face the waves of gunfire from different angle- Kim Qui would be preyed by predators as soon as it enters open waters. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has a powerful forward-facing 40 mm gun
* Has two mounts for dual 20 mm guns

'''Cons:'''

* Blind spot directly forward for 40 mm gun, angling vessel is necessary to fire at short range
* Shallow draft makes it impossible to consistently hit targets in rough seas
* Top speed of 32 km/h in RB, will struggle to cross large maps
* Low crew count of 17 crew members
* Will face destroyers which the ship itself could very unlikely to retaliate 

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
'''PGM-59''' was ordered by the US Navy as military aid supplies to US-allied countries and the ship was designated for the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). The ship was built in '''J.M Martinac''' at '''Tacoma, WA''' and was delivered on March 20, 1963 to US Navy; it was then delivered to '''RVNN''' and renamed to '''HQ-605 Kim Qui'''.<ref>http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/11059.htm</ref>

Due to sparse documents and records of the whereabouts of the ship, after the ship was last seen by USN photographers and having its only 2 known images taken during the 1960s, the ship was very likely been lost in history and the fate of the ship remained unknown.
