The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Red Crimea) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

A modernized Svetlana-class light cruiser, Krasny Krym's WW1 origins are evident from its large amounts of casemate and single gun turrets, laid across the ship's sides. It is armed with 15 x 130 mm guns, arranged in single mounts; while on paper this may seem impressive, it can fire only a maximum of 8 guns at one target, which with its low calibre for its type means it won't do as much damage as other cruisers. The Krasny Krym is also very slow: while its counterparts steam at around 50 - 60 km/h, Krasny Krym's max speed is 48 km/h, only 3 km/h faster than HMS Dreadnought. However, where the Krasny Krym does shine is in its survivability. Whilst the armour on the vessel isn't especially thick, the armour layout is quite comprehensive and most of the ship is protected by at least some armour. An inbound shell coming at a random angle is could easily encounter two or three layers of protection. This keeps the ship relatively resistant to explosive fragmentation and the armouring is thick enough to halt a fair amount of the armour-piercing shells that will be thrown your way at its BR. Along with the armour is a sizeable crew of 852 men, which can allow for the Krasny Krym to endure surprising levels of punishment and keep fighting. Like other cruisers of its tier, Krasny Krym has a decent AA battery which can deter incoming aircraft, though may not stop a determined/suicidal attacker until after they have dropped their ordnance.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
The Krasny Krym has identical belt armour to the Krasny Kavkaz, with a 25mm above waterline belt plate along the entire length of the ship. Below the waterline, a cemented 75mm plate assists in preventing hull breaches. The Krasny Krym has two layers of 25mm deck armour, providing substantial protection against HE and even destroyer and early light cruiser SAP from a distance. The primary armament has a 76mm front plate, with 25mm on the sides and 15mm on the roof. These turrets however are easily destroyed by overpressure and effectively any direct hit by SAP and AP. The bridge is protected by 125mm of cemented armour around all sides with 75mm on the roof, making the bridge nearly invulnerable to most ships of the same BR. 

The crew count of 852 is quite good for an early light cruiser allowing for impressive endurance whilst under constant fire. The numerous turrets results in a large amount of ammunition elevators, making fires a significant threat due to ammunition detonations. The hull armour is able to stop most destroyer and early cruisers rounds whilst angled heavily.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
When compared to the Krasny Kavkaz, the Krasny Krym is a major downgrade in mobility even when fully upgraded. With a max speed of 48/41km/h in Arcade and Realistic respectively.  The ability of the rudder to turn the ship is also significantly worse, making the evasion of torpedos a significant issue. This also makes angling the Krasny Krym quite challenging.

{{main|130 mm/55 pattern 1913 (130 mm)}}

The 130 mm cannons can be described in one word - inadequate. Being destroyer calibre guns mounted on an outdated cruiser chassis they should be treated as such. Do not expect to knock out anything you would not be able to with late Soviet destroyers, the shells are not something you will be proud of. They also have quite low velocity, so you will most likely have troubles with accuracy at range, and much lower explosive mass than other cruisers. Aiming whole broadside is also somewhat difficult, since the guns do not share levels of elevation nor horizontal guidance. Let that not scare you however, for they do have some redeeming qualities.

First off, they are quite numerous. A full HE broadside of 8 guns can be quite devastating for anything unarmoured, but do not wish for miracles. When fighting against DDs you can feel relatively comfortable, blacking out a few compartments at once, but facing any cruiser you should try to aim to disable the enemy's armament first, as you do not have the power or reload to overpower them. You will have serious disadvantage against them but you can dish out some pain if you're lucky, especially since you'll be far from the top of the priority target list.

The guns apart from being numerous are quite spaced out and have relatively thick gun shields. You can safely assume that you will be able to return fire from at least a few guns until the bitter end, since the possibility of rendering all of them useless is quite low. Even if after facing a few salvoes one side of the ship is inoperable, you have old-school broadside cruiser at your disposal, you can always turn the other way and respond with the other side's guns.

Also, remember that you have big ammo reserves, 175 shells per gun at full load - you can be liberal with your fire should you want to.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
{{main|Minizini (100 mm)|45 mm/46 21-K (45 mm)}}

The Krasny Krym has 3 x 100mm/50 Minizini x 2 cannons, which are mostly useless. The most noticeable feature are the unlockable HE-TF (High Explosive Time Fuse) shells, which are able to bring down aircraft.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
{{main|37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)|DShK (12.7 mm)|Vickers Mk.V (12.7 mm)}}

The main backbone of the AA is the 37mm/67 70-K of which 10 are present on the Krasny Krym and are distributed along the entire vessel. 4 x 45mm/46 21-K are placed behind the forward conning towner. There are several machineguns placed on the rear of the vessel, but provide insignificant protection. Overall the AA armament is very effective for an early cruiser, able to ward off most light bombers and fighters. The Krasny Krym does suffer against high altitude bombers due to a lack of duel purpose cannons.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-38 (533 mm)}}

Unfortunately, Krasny Krym's torpedoes are not very effective. There are only 3 per side, and with only a maximum range of 4 km, they are only useful when you are extremely close to your target where your thick armour is useless or are caught by surprise by a flanking destroyer. It may be wise to not take them at all to eschew the risk of the torpedoes exploding to enemy fire.

'''Pros:'''

* Surprisingly survivable
** Ship is well armoured for its type
** Massive crew, allows it to take a lot of hits and keep going
* Capable AA armament
** 10 x 37 mm autocannons, effective at shooting down aircraft
* Large ammo reserves, 2625 rounds can last an entire match
* Easily overlooked if there are more dangerous ships on the field
* When facing enemy head-on, slightly angled, most primary guns can be fired

'''Cons:'''

* Lacking firepower
** Destroyer calibre guns means less damage against enemy ships
** Reload is about the same as other 152 mm gun-armed cruisers
** Low-range and small amount of torpedoes mean they are only effective when you are far too close to an enemy
* Sluggishly slow, similar to some battleships
* Not manoeuvrable at all, large turning circle makes it somewhat hard to dodge torpedoes, bombs, and enemy fire

Krasny Krym was initially laid down in 1913 under the name 'Svetlana', and was the lead ship of her class of four. Svetlana-class light cruisers were intended for the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy and were therefore designed slightly differently in comparison to the closely-related, intended for Black Sea operations, Admiral Nakhimov-class (of which the already familiar Krasny Kavkaz was a part of).

By late 1917, Svetlana was nearing completion. In the meantime however, the Russian Empire was beginning to collapse and the ensuing revolutions, followed by a civil war, halted construction. After the establishment of the Soviet Union, work on the Svetlana continued in 1924, with the ship being renamed 'Profintern'.

Work on the Profintern finally finished in July 1928, with the ship's completed layout closely resembling the original one. Instead of being commissioned into service with the Baltic Fleet as originally planned, Profintern was instead assigned to the ranks of the Black Sea Fleet in 1929.

Throughout the '30s, the Profintern underwent substantial overhaul works, with her auxiliary weapon systems being upgraded and fire control systems improved. Shortly after the outbreak of WW2, the ship was renamed for the second and last time to Krasny Krym in October 1939.

Krasny Krym, similarly to her half-sister Krasny Kavkaz, served the entirety of WW2 as part of various operations in the Black Sea region. Most notably, taking part in the Siege of Sevastopol and the Kerch-Feodosiya Operation. As such, the ship was primarily tasked with escorting various convoys, evacuating and transporting troops as well as bombarding enemy positions with artillery fire. For her performance, Krasny Krym was also awarded with the elite Guards title in June 1942.

Following the end of WW2, Krasny Krym remained in active service for some time, although repurposed on several occasions. July 1959 marked the end of the ship's service, with Krasny Krym being ultimately sold for scrap.
