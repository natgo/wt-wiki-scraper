== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]] as the Flusi 1 and was renamed Krischan der Große in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Krischan der Große is a slow boat. The 88 mm HE round can knock out small motorboats with a single shot and the dual 20 mm quad mounts provide plenty of firepower to the rear and broadsides. As it is a wooden boat, taking fire from anything bigger than .50 cal MGs will make short work of the crew, therefore captains must be cautious. Closing with the enemy is never a good idea. Instead, use the cover of islands and take advantage of friendlies drawing fire. This can allow you to get some quick kills with the 88 mm gun. One of the worst enemies for the Krischan are the light AA barges. They can rain fire down from 2 km with their 20 mm cannons arcing fire over islands and other obstacles, absolutely shredding your crew. The boat handles fine in still water but targeting guns in heavy swells can be a challenge as the boat severely rocks in even moderate seas.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 20 mm AA can ward off aircraft
* Rapid-firing 37 mm cannon can destroy any plane and small boat quickly
* 88 mm cannon is hard-hitting with timed fuze shells
* Large crew size

'''Cons:'''

* Weak armour often results in quick deaths to heavy MGs and autocannons
* 20 mm cannons have a blind spot on the low front. Aircraft diving low can bomb the ship if the 37 mm cannon doesn't shoot it down
* Armament placement means switching between armaments when flanked from the rear

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

As part of the ongoing planning efforts for Operation Sea Lion - the German invasion of Great Britain - the Reich Air Ministry ordered the construction of a prototype anti-aircraft boat in 1940. Envisioned as a compact and simple vessel, the design was to provide cover for landing troops during the invasion as well as protect the coastal areas of the Netherlands and France from low flying aircraft. Hastily developed, the vessel was laid down in Autumn 1940 in Rotterdam, receiving the name "Flusi 1" and subsequently entering service in November 1942.

Soon after commissioning however, the drawbacks of its poorly thought out design became apparent. Namely, the vessel's anti-air weapons weren't fit for use in rough waters due to a lack of stabilization and its aircraft petrol engines were unable to moor at low speeds. As a result, the design was generally disliked and no mass-production order was issued, despite original plans for constructing around 100 units.

Despite continuing service throughout the war, Flusi 1 never took part in any active combat operations. The vessel was later on sunk during an Allied air raid west of Amsterdam in February 1944, ending its brief service career.
