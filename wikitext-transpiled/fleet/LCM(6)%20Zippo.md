== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American armoured gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season IX, "Smell of Victory"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Flamethrower}}

Flamethrowers are a very unique weapon in naval battles and can even burn on the ocean's surface. The system mounted to the LCM(6) Zippo has long range for a flamethrower, but it is very short-ranged in terms of naval weapons.

Like the [[Churchill Crocodile]], one of this weapon system's disadvantages is being mounted to a vehicle that cannot quickly close the gap between it and the enemy to get within range. If they do, however, the flamethrower can make quick work of small vessels with open gun positions. Larger vessels hit by the flamethrowers can be distracted by the fires, as they can be deadly if left uncontrolled.

Though the system is bound to the anti-aircraft suite, the flamethrowers unfortunately do not have the traverse speed or range to effectively combat enemy aircraft. Like other naval weapons, flamethrowers will elevate so that they can reach their effective ranges but with the dual mount, the M73 machine guns will be elevated the same. This means that while the flamethrowers can get on target, the machine guns will be elevated to such a degree that they become virtually unusable since bullet drop differs significantly from the fire arc.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 40 mm Bofors and several 20 mm Oerlikon autocannons
* Features two flamethrowers as a deadly close-range weapon
* Napalm fuel can light the water surface on fire for a brief moment, causing any boats that pass on it to catch fire

'''Cons:'''

* Abysmal top speed and mobility
* Rather poor survivability due to low crew count
* Shallow draught cause the boat to be constantly rocking around even in calm sea, hampering the accuracy
* The 40 mm Bofors is housed in a turret with poor elevation, leaving the boat vulnerable to aircraft attacks

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
[[File:LCM(6)(F) "Zippo" using flamethrower in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|400px|LCM(6)(F) "Zippo" using its flamethrower in Vietnam]]
Many WWII-surplus LCMs (Landing Craft, Mechanized) were modified by the Mobile Riverine Force in Vietnam as "monitor" patrol craft.

Flamethrowers were added to the LCM(6) which increased the offensive capabilities of the vessel, giving it the ability to clear vegetation and burn out enemy positions by the riverside. These flamethrowers gave the vessel the "Zippo" nickname, after a popular brand of cigarette lighters.
