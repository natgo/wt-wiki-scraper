== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the release of the fleet into open beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Survivability is taking advantage of its small size and manoeuvrability, and being extremely tactical in attack vectors. Avoid engagement as long as possible, then strike fast and hard. While it can take a good deal of damage from rounds up to 40 mm, it is big guns with HE rounds found at BR 2.0 that are your greatest threat. The vulnerability in this unarmoured tub is the side, limit exposure as much as possible. Hits on the bow or stern are manageable, minimal crew loss, giving you more time to press your attack. Damage is repaired fast and dries out faster. Again, avoid exposing your side to big cannons, as they are often a 1 shot fatality!

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The LS 3 is an exceedingly capable boat, it can accelerate and decelerate very quickly and turn sharply. Top speed is very good, in the top 10 of fastest boats in-game (excluding hydrofoils). Those qualities will offer a distinct advantage in tiny island maps, where one can quickly duck between islands and pounce on targets when they don't expect you. In open water it can do well by evasive weaving and use of smoke screens. Its turret is 360° azimuth by 90° elevation, freeing you to manoeuvre any way you need for a perfect attack.

{{main|MG151/20 (20 mm)}}

* 1 x 20 mm MG 151 cannon (2 x 600 rounds)

The 20 mm MG 151 can be deadly in proper hands, although surprisingly is it not as effective to the LS 3's 15 mm cannon. At range the dispersion becomes excessive and therefore requires more skill to be successful but it also overheats faster. It has an insane fire rate of 750 rounds per minute, which means it can take small boats and aircraft in its BR in seconds. However, this cannon overheats easily, so never keep firing for too long. At range, fire short half-second bursts. Like the AN/M2 MG (also a type found on aircraft), this gun has large belt capacity and long reloading time.

{{main|LT 1A/1 (450 mm)}}

* 2 x 450 mm LT 1A/1 torpedoes

The LS 4 Esau can carry two 450 mm torpedoes, housed inside the vessel. Identical to the torpedoes carried by its tech tree cousin (the [[LS 3]]), these torpedoes are highly adequate against any large, slow vessels the LS 4 might face at its BR. However, the torpedoes are extremely short-ranged when stock, with a range of just two kilometres. Their speed of 74 km/h is also relatively average for a torpedo of its size. At lower tier battles, the "Torpedo Mode" Modification can be left unchecked, as it allows the torpedoes to travel at a higher speed. As well, the maps are smaller, meaning that there is less distance for the torpedo to travel anyways. If uptiering the LS 4, the Torpedo Mode modification should be considered, as it increases the range of the torpedo significantly at the cost of speed.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The LS 4 is an excellent Rank I unit in-game. While it only possesses a single 20 mm cannon, it is also one of the best weapons in-game mounted high on a full 360° rotation turret with a gracious 80° elevation and whopping 30° depression with no blind spots or dead zone. In short, the gun has better coverage than 2, or even 3 guns on other boats. Ammo options are API-T or HEFI-T, but not the fearsome Minengeschoß shell found on aircraft. Combine its high top speed, two 450 mm torpedoes, and artillery strike call, it is capable of hitting well above its weight class.

Success in-game is using the MG 151 correctly. Trigger discipline is absolutely necessary as the gun can overheat very fast and ruin your sortie right there; use 1/2 second bursts unless point-blank kill strike. As the MG heats up, its precision falls. Up to 1/4 hot is pinpoint, as it gets 1/2 hot round the rounds start spreading and over that you can see rounds fly everywhere. Range wise, one can hit targets at 1,700 m with cold barrel and do minor damage. Best is to be less than 800 m where the accuracy and power rip your targets apart. While default Universal ammo is perfectly fine, consider the HE belt is 50% better (adds 2 HEFI-T) You will be paying for reloads often, so best is to always have Universal as one of your game loads and HE as other in case you forgot to restock ammo. Experiment with the AP belt, as a few of your opponents may be armoured beasts. Don't expect the better results than the LS 3's MG 151/15, results are surprisingly different. Again, keep the MG cool, short bursts unless point-blank.

What it lacks in the protection area, it makes up in mobility. The LS 4 is one of the fasts boats in-game. This, in tandem with its incredibly tight turning circle and slim profile, makes the LS 4 very well suited for cover hopping and flanking capture points. Use its speed to sneak in to capture points and rush at vessels not paying attention. Its high top speed also makes it useful to rush cap points at the beginning of a match. That being said, be careful not to overextend, or you will find yourself overwhelmed very quickly. Instead, use its superior speed to be the first to reach a capture point then hide behind an island, selectively engaging enemies that come into the line of sight. Don't forget your smoke and artillery! Both incredibly useful tools to prevent enemies from hitting you. Although a tiny target, large cannon (50 mm+) ships have a good chance at hitting you well outside your gun's range. Significant threats are the Japanese dual [[40 mm/62 Vickers (40 mm)|40 mm Type 91 AA]] and [[Bofors L/60 Mark 1 (40 mm)|Bofors 40 mm]], and at closer range a battery of 20 mm cannons, like on a [[165 ft PC-451|PC-451]] or [[S-100 (1945)|S-100]]. The sides of the LS are the most vulnerable, so facing directly at the enemy as much as possible.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decently powerful 20 mm MG 151 cannon
* 360° turret with 90° elevation arc.
* High top speed can make it difficult to lead and destroy
* Very good manoeuvrability, can change direction quickly
* High ammo capacity, able to outlast contemporaries in a firefight with good trigger discipline
* Higher rate of fire than its standard counterpart, can dispatch lightly armoured targets rather quickly

'''Cons:'''

* Gun is capable of overheating, limits the usefulness of high ammo capacity
* Very fragile, incredibly vulnerable to large cannons with HE rounds.
* Single gun eliminates almost all offensive capability if disabled
* Long reload time
* Low ammo count overall; limited to two magazines (although resupplied fast at cap point)
* Due to higher rate of fire, it can expend its ammo rather quickly
* No minengeschoß shell option
* 20 mm gun has less penetration than 15 mm counterpart, may struggle against heavier targets

'''Leicht-S-Boot''' (Light-Torpedo boat, or Midget torpedo boat)

In the mid 1930s, the German navy considered small (12.5 m long), fast torpedo boats launched from carrier ships as tactically viable ideas. Two boats of the class called Light (or Midget) Torpedo boat were built, the first (LS 1) was made of wood, while the second (LS 2) was all aluminum built by Dornier Flugzeugwerke. Yes, this is the same Dornier of the famed Do 17, Do 217, and Do 335 aircraft, but not an insane choice given Dornier's well known history of making seaplanes.

At the time the desired engines (Daimler-Benz Maybachs) were not available, thus forced to use less powerful Jumo 205 Diesels, and neither were the torpedoes. Instead of torpedo boats they became minelayers, and combined with other issues resulted in disappointing performance and the idea was put on hold at the start of war in Europe.

The next year the idea was revisited, this time Dornier's all metal boat was chosen, Daimler-Benz MB 507 light Diesel engines and so were 45 cm torpedoes. In addition, a new MG 151 15 mm cannon was installed in a turret on the roof. Two were built, the LS 3 (delivered on October 10th, 1940) and LS 4. There is a deviation from historical and game at this point, as the records indicate the LS 3 carried 4 mines, not torpedoes, and the LS 4 would also have 15 mm cannon, not 20 mm (but the MG 151 was interchangeable, so would be easy to upgrade to 20 mm MG151/20).

Over the years a total of 12 LS were built, with both Jumo 205 and Daimler-Benz MB 507, the latter carrying torpedoes. Surviving combat records place operations in the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea areas. The fate of the boats is lost, but it seems that at least one, LS 12, was captured and used by the Soviets after the war.
