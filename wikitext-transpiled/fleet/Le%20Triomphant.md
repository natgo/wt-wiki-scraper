'''Le Triomphant''' was the fifth of six [[Le Fantasque (Family)|''Le Fantasque''-class]] contre-torpilleurs, entering service on 24 July 1936. Initially based in Brest and part of a scouting division, she became actively involved in World War II, where she escorted convoys and hunted German vessels. Following a skirmish near the Skagerrak in 1940, she underwent repairs in Lorient before relocating to Plymouth due to the German invasion of France. Seized by the British during Operation Catapult, she was transferred to Free France and later served in the Pacific theatre. After enduring significant damage in a 1943 typhoon, she was repaired in Boston and later supported operations in French Indochina. Decommissioned in 1946, she was briefly reactivated before being scrapped in 1957.

Introduced as a reward for the [[Battle Pass: Season XIV, "Airborne General"]] in [[Update "La Royale"]], '''{{Specs|name}}''' features a combination of excellent speed and firepower. However, her main guns suffer from an inability to rotate quickly enough to keep up with the vessel's turn rate - her horizontal targeting speed is slower than that of most heavy cruisers. She is best utilised to counter enemy destroyers and light cruisers. Compared to [[Le Malin|her tech-tree equivalent]], she sacrifices one of the main guns and some of her anti-air capability for an additional torpedo mount.

<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

'''Le Triomphant''' is the fifth of six contre-torpilleurs of the [[Le Fantasque (Family)|''Le Fantasque''-class]]. She was laid down on 28 August 1931, launched on 16 April 1934, and commissioned on 24 July 1936. Upon entering service, she was based in Brest and assigned to a newly-formed ''Division légère'', primarily tasked with scouting. Following the outbreak of World War II, she served in her division, covering convoys and searching for German merchant ships and blockade runners. In the spring of 1940, after a battle near the Skagerrak with German vessels, ''Le Triomphant'' went to Lorient for repairs, but following the German attack on France, she relocated to Plymouth. On 3 July 1940, during [[wikipedia:Operation Catapult|Operation Catapult]] in Plymouth, she was seized by the British and a month later was handed over to Free France.

For a time, she was based in the [[wikipedia:Firth of Clyde|Firth of Clyde]] in northern Scotland before being deployed to the Pacific Ocean, where she primarily escorted convoys. In August 1941, she passed through the Panama Canal to begin her service in the Pacific theatre. In late 1941, she visited French Polynesia and British Fiji, being based off Tahiti. After the tour, she was ordered to return to service in the Mediterranean, but the outbreak of the Pacific War led to her remaining in the theatre, mostly performing escort duties and evacuations in the southwestern Pacific. At the end of 1943, she again received orders to relocate to the Mediterranean, but en route in the Indian Ocean, she was caught in a severe typhoon, sustaining significant damage and flooding. With great difficulty, she was brought to French Madagascar, from where, after temporary repairs, she proceeded to Boston for extensive repairs and modernisation, which were completed by mid-1945. She was then deployed to the shores of French Indochina to support ground forces. ''Le Triomphant'' served in this region until the spring of 1946, when she was recalled to France and placed in reserve. She was briefly reactivated in November 1947 and served for another two years before being returned to reserve status. She remained in this state until 1957, when she was sold for scrap.

The Le Fantasque series of destroyers were designed to operate in homogeneous formations as an alternative to light cruisers. All ships of this series were launched and commissioned between 1933 and 1936, and were modernized many times over time. Le Triomphant, like its sister ships, actively took part in the events of World War II during the Norwegian operation. After the surrender of France, it was captured by the British and then was used by Free France as part of their maritime forces. It also operated in the Pacific Ocean, escorting convoys from Australia and New Zealand as well as in Vietnam in 1945 to 1946. Serving until 1949, the Le Triomphant met its ultimate demise when it was dismantled and sold for scrap in 1957.
