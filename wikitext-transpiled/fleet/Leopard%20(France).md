== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The Chacal-class vessels were the first large destroyers made for the modern French Navy after the First World War. They featured a larger displacement than all of the preceding destroyers, and mounted more firepower to contend with the contemporary navies of the time. The Léopard was the third ship to be launched, out of the 6 ships that were built. She was commissioned into service on the same day as the Lynx, one of her sister ships, and participated in one of the most famous events of the war, Operation Dynamo, the Dunkirk evacuation. She is depicted in-game after she was converted into an escort destroyer, removing her forward boiler room for increased fuel stores - thus she is visually identifiably by her only having two funnels, compared to the three her sisters have.

Thanks to this change, the greatest drawback of the Léopard is her very low top speed of 58 km/h (31.3 kn), making her one of the slowest destroyers in the game. In addition, to make room for the improved AA battery, the rear 550 mm torpedo launcher had to be removed, giving her a salvo of only 3 torpedoes. The torpedoes should be saved for close range fights against more dangerous opponents, as the low number of torpedoes make them very inefficient to launch at large distances.

Introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]], the Léopard can fulfill multiple roles, such as providing both anti-aircraft cover and heavy fire support for friendly ships. Despite her slow speed, her deadly 130 mm guns outclass many other weapons of her tier. These guns have a shorter effective range than some other guns due to their lower velocity, however, they make up for this with their powerful ammunition.

=== Survivability and armour ===
[[File:Leopard 10mm Gunshields.PNG|thumb|250x250px|The 10 mm gunshields are one of the only forms of armour on the Léopard]]
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Léopard, being a large destroyer with a high displacement, has a sizeable crew for her rank, numbering 246 men. As with most destroyers of the rank, she mounts no protection, with the exception being her lightly armoured 130 mm guns and anti-aircraft weapons. The primary protection of the Léopard is her mobility, however, even that can not be relied upon. Her anti-aircraft weaponry is a notable point, as compared to other French vessels, such as her sister ship [[Chacal]] and the smaller [[Bourrasque]], she mounts a much improved, and needed, anti-aircraft battery.
[[File:Leopard 12.7mm Gunshields.PNG|thumb|250x250px|The 12.7 mm gunshields on the Léopard]]
Getting hit in the Léopard usually results in a fire, as her internal modules, such as the boilers and fuel tanks, are close together. However, the magazines of the 130 mm guns are small and hard to hit, and are further protected by being placed below the waterline, making it harder for enemy munitions to penetrate the hull and detonate the ammo.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Léopard reaches a top speed of 58 km/h (31.3 kn), making her one of the slowest destroyers in the game; this is the greatest drawback and main limiting factor for the Léopard. This is further worsened by a very slow turn rate, slower than even the [[Besposhchadny]], notorious for being a sluggish destroyer. An exceptional are should be taken to avoid torpedoes and bombs as early as possible, especially until Rudder Replacement modification is unlocked.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

As with all vessels, Tool Set and Fire Protection System should be researched first. Like other French destroyers, research of the SAPBC rounds is recommended, as this greatly increases her firepower, followed by the mobility modifications. If you find yourself doing fine with the standard HE rounds, the mobility upgrades are a great alternative, as this gives her a desperately needed increase in mobility.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|130 mm/40 model 1919 (130 mm)}}

The primary armament of the Léopard consists of 4 x 130 mm Mle.19 naval guns, two each mounted at the bow and stern of the vessel. These guns have a low rate of fire compared to most other ships of the Léopards tier, however, these guns have extremely deadly ammunition.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* Very high calibre ammunition with a large explosive filler in both HE and SAP
* Low profile makes it more difficult to hit
* Decent anti-air/anti-coastal armament

'''Cons:'''
* Very low muzzle velocity of the main guns
* Exceptionally poor mobility compared to the counterparts
* Very large fuel tanks make it prone to fires
