{{main|SK C/34 (127 mm)}}

The main armament of the Luchs consists of three 127 mm naval cannons, one at the front of the ship and the other two at the back. These cannons can shoot three types of ammunition. First, the Sprgr. Kpf.Z HE shell with 2 kg of TNT equivalent and a muzzle velocity of 830 m/s. This is the standard ammo for this destroyer. Next is the Sprgr. Bd.Z, a base-fused HE shell with more penetration in most cases but less explosive mass, only 1.4 kg of TNT equivalent and the same muzzle velocity. Finally, the Sprgr. Zt.Z comes with the same amount of TNT and muzzle velocity as the Sprgr. Bd.Z but with a time fuse, which can be useful when engaging enemy aircraft.

[[File:Luchs-1934.jpg|thumb|350px|Type 1924 Luchs as seen in 1934.]]
The Type 1924 Luchs was the fourth of six Type 1924 large torpedo boats built for the Kriegsmarine in the 1920s. With a substantial main and secondary armament, the Type 1924 class ships were among the heaviest armed torpedo boats of their era. Luchs was commissioned in the late 1920s, and sailed on several non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War. She served extensively during the early days of the Second World War and was eventually sunk by a torpedo or mine in July of 1940.

=== Design and development ===
The "Type 24" class of 1924 were a class of six heavy torpedo boats built for the German navy. Despite them being extremely heavily armed and close to destroyer-size, they were classified as torpedo boats by the German navy. In War Thunder, these vessels are classified as destroyers. The ships displaced 1,300 tons full load and could make a top speed of 34 knots (63 km/h). They had a crew of 129 crew members, which was relatively small for a destroyer but large for a torpedo boat. Luchs carried three 10.5 cm (4 inch) naval guns, as well as six 533 mm torpedo tubes. Later on, she received four 2 cm Flakvierling anti-aircraft guns for air defence. Luchs was the fourth ship of her class to be laid down, in April of 1927 at Wilhelmshaven. Following her completion, she was commissioned in April of 1929.

=== Operational history ===
After her commissioning, the Luchs sailed on several non-intervention patrols to the area around Spain during the Spanish Civil War; there is little other information about her pre-war service. Upon the start of the Second World War, Luchs was active in the North Sea area, laying mines and providing cover for capital ships. She later escorted the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper into the Norwegian area at the start of the German Norwegian campaign.

Later on in early 1940, Luchs was assigned to an invasion force intending to capture the Norwegian port city of Kristensand. The task force consisted of the Konigsberg-class light cruiser Karlsruhe, Luchs, and her sister-ship Seeadler. The ships ended up in a lengthy engagement with the Norwegian coastal battery defending the city. Initially, the troop-laden ships were hit and ordered to turn back to make a second run, this time angling to enable the use of all their main guns. Several more attempts by the German force failed to destroy the battery, as their poor accuracy sent more shells into the city than onto the battery itself.

Finally, the German commander ordered one more run, transferring all the invasion troops into four smaller E-boats. Due to some confusion by the Norwegian battery believing the German ships to be Allied vessels, the troops landed without issue and captured the city. Luchs then set out to sea again, escorting the Karlsruhe back towards Kiel. During this time, the Karlsruhe was hit by a torpedo from a British submarine and damaged; the Luchs took prompt action to depth-charge the attacker, which succeeded in doing damage but failed to sink the attacker. In July, the Luchs was ordered to escort the crippled battleship Gneisenau after she was damaged by Allied bombers. However, during this time, the Luchs suddenly exploded and sank. It is not known what caused her sudden demise, but it is believed that she was either torpedoed or hit an allied mine.
