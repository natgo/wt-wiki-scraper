== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German sub-chaser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The M-17's armour is decent for its rank, able to shrug off small to medium-calibre rounds from torpedo boats. However when facing larger-calibre guns from other gun boats and destroyers the armour lacks protection, especially the turrets which can be disabled easily. The fuel tanks are located in the centre of the hull and can result in frequent fires. However it can still take many large destroyer rounds to destroy the ship as the crew is spread out. It is preferred to upgrade the armour for even better crew and ammo rack protection.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
{{NavalMobility}}

The M-17 is very sluggish to accelerate and turn. Manoeuvres must be planned well in advance to avoid torpedoes and running aground. It is recommended to upgrade the rudder first to improve turn time as well as the engine, propeller and crew to improve both acceleration and deceleration and make it a more potent gunship.

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|SK C/32 (105 mm)}}

The two 10.5 cm main guns are very effective and have good reload time and muzzle velocity, able to knock out small boats in two or three well-placed hits. The upgraded armour-piercing ''L/4.4 Bd.Z'' is recommended for hardened targets such as armoured boats and gun ships but is not very effective on one-to-one with destroyers. The gun's horizontal traverse favours a broadside attack or angling about 45 degrees towards the target to minimise exposure.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2 cm/65 C/38 (20 mm)|2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 (20 mm)}}

The M-17 is fitted with multiple 20 mm Flak cannons which are effective against small boats and are accurate against low-flying aircraft less than 2.5 km away. The short reload time contributes to a large volume of fire that can repel enemy attacks. However, the main quad 20 mm is positioned towards the stern and cannot fire directly forwards and the front is only protected by the two port and starboard cannons.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|WBG depth charge|EMC mine}}

There are no light machine guns nor 37 mm cannons like the similar M-802. There is an upgrade to a powerful anti-submarine bomb mortar but its use is very limited and opportunistic in-game. The slow speed of the M-17 makes mines difficult to set up and use effectively.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The M-17 is similar to the M-802 but without the reinforced engine armour or the torpedoes. As with most sub-chasers, it's slow and won't arrive first to the battlefield, but the ship has well armoured 105 mm main guns with enough fire power to hull break many ships or pen destroyers with base fuze HE in desperate scenarios. Facing destroyers is ill-advised as they have higher caliber guns in larger quantity.

This ship should be used at long range to allow for more time to react to smaller vessels as well as the torpedoes as the slow speed of this ship makes it a torpedo and artillery magnet. In a pinch, the vessel can litter a capture point with mines, albeit they require a lot of skill and patience to use and often act as an extra ammo rack prone to detonate. The high position of the player's angle of view makes spotting targets behind obstacles much easier.

To counter this vessel, the most vulnerable place is the bow where the ammo rack is. A single bomb or torpedo there is guaranteed to sink the vessel. The safest option would be swarming the M-17 as multiple ships at different flanks will overwhelm the ship easily.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Heavy-hitting main armament can knock out many coastal vessels
* Coastal spawn allows the vehicle to face small vessels
* Fast reload rate
* High survivability
* Can carry many mines

'''Cons:'''

* Sluggish speed makes this ship vulnerable to torpedoes
* Outgunned by destroyers
* Massive/tall target
* Low calibre AA is ineffective at long ranges
