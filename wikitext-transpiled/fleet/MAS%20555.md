== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->The MAS 555 was a torpedo motor torpedo boat ('''M'''otoscafo '''A'''rmato '''S'''ilurante) of the MAS 500 class whose purpose was to attack enemy ships, anti-submarine and escort operations, it was built in 1941 with the other twins of the 3rd Series which were armed with a single [[20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)|20mm/65 Breda (20mm)]], two 450mm torpedo launchers for surface targets and six depth charges for enemy submarines, the MAS 555 was used both by the Regia Marina until 1943, and by the Italian Co-Belligerent Navy after the armistice, eventually to be sunk in the German landing at Rhodes in Greece in the same year.

On War Thunder, the ship added on [[Update "Starfighters"|"Starfighters" update]] is presented as an excellent torpedo bomber capable of rapid attacks on enemy ships with torpedoes and depth charges if you take her against destroyers and other deep-sea ships, while the main armament consists of a 20mm Breda capable of causing good damage to enemy coastal ships, if it comes to survival instead it can only survive a few hits from enemy ships and you are also very vulnerable to enemy air attacks.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The MAS 555's hull is protected only by 40 mm of wood with the superstructure featuring 15 mm of wood. It does not have any kind of external or internal armour this means that the ship is more vulnerable to ammunition. The survivability of the MAS 555 in general is poor because the ship only has 13 crew members, which makes it an easy target to destroy in combat.

Comparable options to the MAS 555 are the [[LS 3]], the [[G-5]], or the [[PT-6]], they however have more survivability and can resist more shots.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The MAS 555 is a very fast ship up to 80 km/h in RB, 112 km/h AB. It is very manoeuvrable, this makes it very fast and agile. Providing the ability to reach the enemy quickly to initiate a first strike by launching its torpedoes and allowing sneak attacks with its use of depth charges to destroy enemy boats easily with a few drops. Thanks to its agility, it can dodge shots and make surprise/lateral attacks.

{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
[[File:MAS 555 2.png|thumb|400x400px|The firing angles of the autocannon, unable to fire directly in front]]
{{main|20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)}}

The primary armament, in fact the only armament, is a Breda 20 mm cannon. It has a rate of fire of 240 shots/min and a 12-shot magazine before reloading for a minimum of 1.8 seconds. The cannon is unable to shot in front of the ship, it is necessary to locate broadside or turn your ship 180 degrees.

Three different belts containing two different shells are available:

* Universal: {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}
* HE belt: {{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}  {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}
* AP belt: {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}

{{:20_mm/65_Breda_(20_mm)/Ammunition|HEFI-T*, API-T}}

These belts are mostly the same, the HEFI-T belt is slightly more suitable against wooden boats, like [[Higgins 81 ft PT-6|PT-6]] and the [[MTB-1 1 series|MTB 1]], as well as low flying aircraft, while the API-T belt is slightly more suitable against component damage and steel boats, like the [[LS 3]] and the [[G-5]].

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|W.200/450X5,75 (450 mm)|B TG depth charge}}

Two 450 mm steam turbined W.200/450X5,75 torpedoes on the left and on the right of the ship are a useful tool against larger sub chasers and gunboats when being able to sneak up. They have a maximum speed 81 km/h, a range of 3 km, and an explosive filler of 200 kg, enough to destroy any ship at the battle rating.

The MAS is one of the reserve boats able to carry six B TG depth charges with an explosive filler of 50 kg. These however are extremely situational and most of the time defensive in nature, as you have to drive in front of the enemy ship, or wait for the enemy to pass you, to utilize these weapons. Furthermore, 50 kg of explosives is very weak for a depth charge, as most others have around 100-140 kg of TNT, limiting effective use even further.

But despite the drawbacks, making a kill with these is one of, if not the most, satisfying ways to destroy an enemy player and equally humiliating for those who are on the receiving end.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MAS 555 is a rather strange boat, despite being the reserve boat equipped with the largest calibre, its slow rate of fire and small magazine, as well as the inability to fire directly forwards drastically limits its potential. However, it can still be a significant threat to other ships.

The best strategy whilst using the cannon is not to drive forward into battle, but to turn your rear to the enemy, and sailing in reverse. This way you can negate the limiting firing arcs at the front and still only reveal a small part of the hull, which extends your life expectancy by a few crucial seconds. The best way is to stay behind cover and move only rearwards when engaging and then back into cover. A one on one fight against almost any other PT boat will not go in your favour, therefore the element of surprise is most important.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good top speed forwards and backwards
* Good turn time
* Equipped with 2 torpedoes
* Good acceleration.

'''Cons:'''

* The 20 mm cannon can't shoot in the front of the ship, angle of fire is only 270°
* The cannon has small magazines and a slow rate of fire
* Very unstable gun platform, can be very difficult to make precise shots
* Although it a good armament for a reserve boat, the 20 mm does not consistently inflict damage
* No anti-aircraft protection
* Poor survivability: no armour and low crew count
* Aircraft can strafe the ship and knock it out with a few well placed shots.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
{{main|MAS 500 (Family)#History|l1=History of the Velocissimo Classe 500}}

After the armistice of 8 September 1943, the MAS 555 was used by Co-Belligerent Italy, in particular it was used together with two British motor boats against a German landing convoy on 12 November 1943, after a few hours the MAS 555 was sunk during the German landing at Rhodes in Grecce.
