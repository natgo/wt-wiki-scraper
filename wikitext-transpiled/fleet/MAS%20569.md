== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The MAS 569 was one of the final 4th Series of the [[MAS 500 (Family)|MAS Tipo "500"]]. Compared to those of the 3rd Series, it had some minor changes such as the adoption of the manoeuvre rudder on the bridge, the increase of the ammunition supply for the Breda 20 mm/65 autocannon and the addition of support for the Breda 6.5 mm machine gun. MAS 569 participated in the Italian Black Sea Flotilla from August 1942 and arrived on 30 July 1942 in Yalta. In the same year, she was damaged by enemy bombardment. After 1942, she entered service with the German Navy only to be later delivered to the Romanian Navy on 28 August 1943, her fate was to sink somewhere in the Black Sea in August 1944.

Intoduced as a premium along with the initial Italian naval tree in [[Update "Starfighters"]], the MAS 569 has incredible speed in both Arcade and Realistic and manoeuvrability which allows it to quickly reach enemy targets and launch torpedoes or depth charges. The armament is composed of a single 20 mm cannon and a single 6.5 mm machine gun: the 20 mm can cause quite a bit of damage to enemy boats, however the 6.5 mm has a small magazine and fires too quickly, so it is always worth going out at the right times with the 20 mm to destroy enemy ships with the torpedoes, depth charges, and the 20 mm.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The MAS 569 is made entirely from wood, the hull has about 40 mm of wood for the hull and 15 mm for the superstructure.

It can withstand blows up to 20 mm, beyond 20 mm it really starts to struggle in fact it will only take a few moments to sink. On the MAS there are 15 sailors, which may seem few, but compared to the 6 members of the G-5 and 7 of the LS, these 15 are enough and advanced.

The advantage of having a relatively small ship and many members is that it will not take long to repair and extinguish the ship.

Another thing to be careful about is if you hit a reef you will lose crew or in the worst scenario the entire ship.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The MAS 569 is propelled to a speed of 80 km/h thanks to 2 Isotta Fraschini engines outputting 500 horsepower. The peculiarity of the MAS is that its 2 engines are civilian engines, not special engines only for the armed forces, these engines are used by Regia Aeronautica too.

These two engines are also capable of going to -33 km/h.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)|Breda Mod.30 (6.5 mm)}}

The primary armament is composed of one 20 mm Breda 20/65 and a 6.5 mm Breda Mod.30 as secondary primary.

The 6.5 mm Breda is infamous among Italian soldiers for being an unreliable and weak machine gun that has a lengthy reload for a considerably small box magazine of 20 bullets. Meanwhile, the 20 mm Breda 20/65 will be the main workhorse in regards of damage output, offering a shorter magazine at 12 shells, it at least deals damage.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|W.200/450X5,75 (450 mm)|B TG depth charge}}

The MAS 569 is equipped with two types of additional armament. The first one is the W.200 torpedo, a torpedo that can navigate up to 81 km/h for 3 km, while losing 7 km/h but gaining 1,000 m of range with the torpedo mode modification. These two torpedoes are excellent for quick attacks on larger ships. With their good speed and 200 kg of explosive, it will be child's play to sink a ship.

The second additional armament of the MAS 569 is the depth charge B TG, 6 depth charges can be used in total and are positioned at the back of the ship. The B TGs with their 60 kg of explosive each are very effective to destroy ships that get a little too close, you can also flank the big ships and throw them at them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MAS 569 is a rather odd ship, the 20 mm cannon has a low rate of fire and small magazine, as well as being unable to fire directly forward, drastically limit its potential, but thanks to the 6.5 mm the MAS 569 in the front you can do a little damage to some of the enemy boats. The best choice when using the cannon and machine gun is not to sail forwards, but to stay to the side. This allows you to use the entire operational area of the weapons.

The best way is to stay behind cover and only move backwards when engaging and then return to cover. One-on-one combat against almost any other reserve boat will not work in your favour, so the element of surprise is very important.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast speed (80 km/h)
* Short turn time
* Good acceleration
* Effective torpedoes

'''Cons:'''

* No armour
* 20 mm cannon has small magazines and slow rate of fire
* Terrible survivability in combat
* 20 mm cannon has limited angles of fire

[[File:MAS 569 (1).png|thumb|MAS 569 sailing]]
The MAS 569 is part of the final series of the MAS type "500" PT boats. It was part of the Italian Black Sea flotilla and participated in the August 1942 attack on Soviet cruiser Molotov.

Deployed in the Alto Tirreno FMO until May 1942, MAS 569 was sent with MAS 568 to the Black Sea, arriving in Yalta on 30 July 1942, the MAS 569 was heavily damaged in a Soviet bombing of Yalta in September 1942.<ref>Walter S. Zapotoczny Jr., "Decima Flottiglia MAS: The Best Commandos of the Second World War", p. 122</ref>

During the evening of 14 February 1943, while returning from a mission, it sighted a Soviet submarine surfacing about 10 miles to the east.

The crew of the MAS 569 went to attack the Soviet submarine launching 2 torpedoes which did not hit the target, after having ascertained the negative outcome of the torpedoes launching they headed towards the Soviet submarine to launch depth charges to try to sink the submarine. They also used the 6.5 mm Breda Mod.30 to damage it but it jammed after a few shots, after having damaged it the Soviet submarine submerged and they lost track.

Between March and April 1943, together with the MAS of the IVa Flottiglia, it took part in numerous battles with Soviet patrol boats and gunboats and some demonstrative actions along the enemy coast.

On 20 May 1943 the MAS 569 was loaned to the German Navy, assuming the German designation S 504.

Then ceded on 28 August 1943 to the Romanian Navy, and was scuttled at Costanza or somewhere in the Black Sea in August 1944.
