== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet armoured gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] with the fleet release into open beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The MBK pr. 186 (MK 85) has significantly more armour than its predecessors all-around, and can take a fair beating as a result. The middle portion of this ship has 30 mm of rolled homogeneous armour, while the front and back have protection of 8-12 mm. This defence makes machine gun fire much less dangerous, almost a relic of the past. However, this additional armour makes this ship much heavier, and detrimentally affects the speed, as elaborated in the next section.

The 85 mm gun turrets have significantly less armour than the main tree version.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The MBK pr. 186 (MK 85) has an abysmal top speed of 35 km/h in AB. The turning speed is also terrible, and it will take more than a dozen seconds to completely turn around, however it does start the turn quite rapidly, making dodging torpedoes a reasonable option. Due to this fact, the vessel must be played with very strategically chosen movements, as becoming exposed with no quick way out is one of the most common ways to be destroyed in this ship.

{{main|85 mm/54.6 ZIS-C-53 (85 mm)}}

The MBK pr. 186 has two 85 mm guns in single turrets as its main guns. These guns fare fairly well against medium-sized ships due to their reasonable calibre, and can sometimes hull-break small ships, although small enough ships are seldom encountered at this battle rating. Up until this point, HE shells were the indisputably best shell for naval combat due to the lack of armour anywhere. HE should be your usual load, although APHE shells are useful vs other armoured gunboats, and also sometimes against larger vessels.

{{main|37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)}}

A single 37 mm autocannon comprises the secondary armament. This is the same model as the one used on the [[Pr.1124 late]] and the [[BMO]] as well as the [[MPK-163]]. This gun is a fairly good secondary gun due to its calibre and good rate of fire, and can tackle both small to medium-sized ships and most air targets.

{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

Two twin-mount 12.7 mm DShK turrets that are mounted on the sides of the command bridge at the centre of the ship. As such, only one turret can engage a target at a time due to the interrupted arc of fire, unless the target is directly in front or behind the ship. This is not the most desirable positioning, but it will work most of the time deterring air attacks, with the help of the 37 mm autocannon.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The MBK Pr. 186 (MK 85) is quite an interesting ship to play, due to its unique set of characteristics - heavy armament, good armour, and ridiculously bad manoeuvrability. With a pair of hard-hitting 85 mm cannons slapped on a hull with some anti-aircraft armament, this ship is very well suited for a certain set of playstyles and can excel in a variety of situations if used correctly.

'''Tactics:'''

The MBK Pr. 186 can work very well in certain situations, particularly longer-range engagements. This is because of its great weapons load, namely two 85 mm cannons. While they don't fire particularly fast, they hit very hard and can do a lot of damage to naval targets. Assuming you have decent accuracy, you can easily sink any ships at the Pr. 186's BR with a couple of shots. However, note that the Pr. 186 does also have access to a powerful Soviet 37 mm 70-K cannon mounted behind the bridge - this weapon is much more suited for dealing with fast vessels and aircraft, as it can fire continuously against any targets that the 85 mm guns cannot hit as easily. Finally, the Pr. 186 has access to four 12.7 mm machine guns in two twin turrets, which can serve as an effective anti-aircraft armament alongside the 37 mm cannon.

The MBK Pr. 186 is quite survivable, with 42 crew members and armour up to 30 mm on the hull. The 85 mm gun turrets are also well-protected with 30 mm of armour, though this is less than the tech-tree version, which gets up to 90 mm of armour. This armour provides the Pr. 186 with extensive protection which makes it impervious to most small-arms fire, meaning that it could potentially be used as a brawler against smaller PT boats and coastal vessels. However, the ship's survivability should not be relied upon exclusively, as the ship will easily be destroyed by the larger coastal ships and destroyers that it faces often. Instead, captains should rely extensively on available island cover to protect their ship. In the case of an open map (the conquest maps), try to stay further away from enemy bluewater vessels to maximise survivability.

Finally, the MBK Pr. 186 suffers from a rather terrible manoeuvrability, with a poor turning circle and a rather disappointing top speed of 26 km/h in RB. Thus, the ship cannot be relied upon to capture zones, as it will take ages just to get to the capture point. In general, this ship should be played as a longer-range sniper, maximising the use of its powerful armament.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 2 x 85 mm provide plenty of firepower to destroy boats
* Secondary and AA armament is on a par with the main armament of most other PT boats
** Good crew count for its size, 42 crew members
* Armour provides significant protection against machine-guns and small calibre cannon HE ammunition
* Low silhouette, making it rather difficult to hit at longer ranges

'''Cons:'''

* Slow, with a top speed of just 26 km/h in RB spaded
* Secondary armament is located in a weird position, limiting firing arcs for the 37 mm and 12.7 mm guns
* Faces early destroyers very often, where it has a significant survivability disadvantage
* Part of the bow and the entire stern is unprotected, leaving a large part of the ship's crew vulnerable
* Gun turrets are less armoured than the tech tree version

The MBK pr. 186 (MK 85) was a class of 38 armoured gun boats built for the Soviet navy during the latter part of the Second World War. Designed as sea-going armoured boats, the ships were fitted with a heavy armament. Upon commissioning, the ships of the class supplemented the prior pr. 161 in service and saw extensive service during the war. The ships served after the end of the war until their eventual retirement in the late 1950s. This version of the vessel represents the later-production version of the pr. 186, which featured newer MK 85 turrets.

The pr. 186 class of MBKs (armoured gun boats) were designed as large but slow armoured boats as a supplement to the pr. 161 class. The ships displaced 156.5 tons and were 36.2 m long. The ships had a relatively modest top speed of 14 knots (26 km/h) and a range of 750 miles, being powered by a pair of 500 hp piston engines. The ships had a crew of 42 officers and men.

In terms of armament, the pr. 186 was equipped with two 85 mm ZiS-C-53 cannons on MK 85 cannon mounts. Initially, the guns were mounted on S-53 mounts, which is seen in game on the tech-tree version of this vessel. However, most late-production pr. 186s were equipped with the later MK 85 mount, with less armour but dramatically-improved vertical targeting. The ships carried a secondary armament of a single 37 mm 70-K dual purpose autocannon and two dual DShK machine gun turrets. Some ships were also fitted with a mortar.

A total of 38 pr. 186 ships were built between 1944 and 1947; being late production vessels, the pr. 186 (MK 85) ships failed to see service during the Second World War. The other vessels constructed during the Second World War saw brief service in the Baltic Sea, where they provided fire support for Soviet land forces. Overall, the Soviet MBKs, including the MBK-161, pr. 1124 and pr. 1125, played an important role in the Great Patriotic War. Loss rates were also high, as 90 boats were lost for roughly 300 boats of all classes built. The later MBK pr. 186s stayed in the fleet until the late 1950s, when they were retired.
