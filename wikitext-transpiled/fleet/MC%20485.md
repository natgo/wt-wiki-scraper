== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
With the Presidential Decree of 11 February 1952, several torpedo motorboats of the Elco and Vosper types were acquired, but one of them in particular was the S-26 of German origin renamed MC-485, part of the 1 February 1952, the patrol boat (MV) 621 was registered in the State Military Naval Register, the unit was a German torpedo boat of the S-26 type which survived the war and was captured by Great Britain in 1945, in 1948 it had been sold to private individuals for commercial use under the name of ''Torus'', it was acquired at the beginning of 1952 and sent to the La Spezia Military Arsenal to be refitted, on 1 November 1952 she was reclassified as torpedo motor torpedo boat, taking the name MS 621 and as NATO pennant number (P) 460, in 1953 the construction work was completed, on 1 January 1954 she was given the new name MC 485 and the pennant number changed to (P) 485 and was classified as a motor torpedo boat, in 1963 she was sent to the Taranto Arsenal for a cycle of extraordinary works, but as the hull had given way in several places, it was not considered advisable to proceed with her refit, and the unit was laid up on 1 July 1964 and then decommissioned on 1 March 1966.

The MC-485 introduced in the [[Update "La Royale"|"La Royale" Update]], as a Battle Pass reward vehicle: [[Battle Pass: Season XII, "Armour Breaking Ambusher"|Season XII, "Armour Breaking Ambusher"]], is a German Schnellboot class ship modified by the Italians with radar, 2 Italian 40mm cannons and the replacement of the German torpedoes with Italian ones, being Premium grants more PR and SL, the ship has good manoeuvrability and firepower thanks to the two 40mm Bofors mounted at the rear that guarantee continuous damage and penetration of enemy battleships, but as they are positioned behind the guns cannot aim frontally, this causes a major weakness to the ship at the front the survivability of the Schnellboot is very low, but is always compensated for by the speed and manoeuvrability that helps you to aim and make surprise attacks on larger ships with torpedoes

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
