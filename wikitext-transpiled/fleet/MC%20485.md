== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
With the Presidential Decree of 11 February 1952, several torpedo motorboats of the Elco and Vosper types were acquired, but one of them in particular was a German torpedo boat of the S-26 type, which survived the war and was captured by Great Britain in 1945. In 1948, it was sold to private individuals for commercial use under the name of ''Torus''. It was acquired by the Italian Navy at the beginning of 1952 and sent to the La Spezia Military Arsenal to be refitted, reclassified as motor torpedo boat on 1 November 1952, taking the name MS 621 and NATO pennant number (P) 460. Construction work was completed in 1953. On 1 January 1954, she was given the new name MS 485 and the pennant number changed to (P) 485. On 10 September 1954, the boat was renamed MC 485 and classified as a motor cannon boat. In 1963, she was sent to the Taranto Arsenal for a cycle of extraordinary works, but as the hull had given way in several places, it was not considered advisable to proceed with her refit, and the unit was laid up on 1 July 1964 and then decommissioned on 1 March 1966.

Introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XII, "Armour Breaking Ambusher"]], MC 485 is a German Schnellboot class ship modified by the Italians with radar, two Italian 40 mm cannons, and the replacement of the German torpedoes with Italian ones. The ship has good manoeuvrability and firepower thanks to the two 40 mm Bofors cannons mounted at the rear that guarantee continuous damage and penetration of enemy boats, but as they are positioned behind the guns cannot aim frontally, which causes a major weakness to attacks from the front. The survivability of the Schnellboot is very low, but it is compensated for by the speed and manoeuvrability that helps you to aim and make surprise attacks on larger ships with torpedoes.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Unlike most low-BR vessels, Schnellboots have an armoured bridge, with 10 mm rolled homogeneous steel sloped between 2 and 76°, which makes it relatively rare to lose control over the vessel. While this, combined with a relatively large size, might make the vessel appear to be very survivable, in reality it's a fragile vessel. A mediocre crew count, few internal compartments, wooden hull, and the necessity to expose its sides to deliver the bulk of the firepower, make it an easy target to destroy.

The best survivability can be achieved by moving directly towards or away from the enemy, where a single compartment is exposed to the enemy fire. The second-best option is to approach the enemy at an angle, where the exposed silhouette remains relatively small.

=== Mobility ===

<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
With a top speed of 101 km/h, the MC 485 can beat even the hydrofoils in a straight line. It's one of the faster naval vessels in the game, making it perfect for capturing the points and relocating to more comfortable locations when dealing with a bluewater vessels. For its large size, the vessel remains relatively manoeuvrable, being able to even dodge incoming high-calibre projectiles. That being said, its large size also impacts the turning circle, making it easier to crash into islands or other surface obstacles while manoeuvring in narrow areas of the map designed for smaller coastal vessels.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Much like all premium vessels, MC 485 comes with all modifications unlocked and installed. If used in Coastal matches, it might be best to uninstall the Torpedo mode modification, in order to trade shorter range for a much higher speed of the Tipo L torpedoes. When taking the MC 485 into higher BR bluewater matches, it's best to leave it installed, as the 8 km range give them great utility.

{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)}}

The main weapons of the MC 485 are two Bofors L/60 Mark 3. Their firing angles make it impossible to engage enemy warships directly front and aft of the vessel, making it tricky to use, but the overall firepower is relatively impressive for its BR. It is, however, lacking when pulled into a high BR matches.

In terms of the ammunition choice, the Universal or APT magazines are recommended against surface targets, while HET magazines are best used against aerial targets.

APT magazines have an advantage in being able to pierce through the ship, oftentimes entering through the bow and exiting through the rear of a small torpedo boats. These are best used against ships approaching directly frontally (e.g. in an attempt to bow tank).

HET magazines are highly advantageous against aerial targets, there they'll do the highest amount of damage per the round hit, while also offering the best chance of igniting the fuel tanks. Alternatively, they can be used against a particularly small boats, such as [[LS 3]] or [[G-5]].

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 270/533X6.84 Tipo L (533 mm)}}

The 533 mm Tipo L torpedoes are some of the best that Italy has to offer, featuring a great combination of range and speed, while still maintaining a decently sized, 270 kg, warhead. While it will struggle against larger warships, especially these equipped in a torpedo bulges, it's sufficient to deal with lesser targets.

For matches with destroyers, it's best to keep the torpedo mode installed, as increasing that range from 4 to 8 km makes a difference between life and death. However, against coastal vessels, it's best to uninstall it and benefit from a small (13%) increase in speed.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MC 485 can be used in much the same way as the other [[S-boot (Family)|Schnellboots]]. Making a use of all your firepower requires you to expose an entire broadside - if an enemy sprays your entire broadside, you'll most likely die right away. This creates an interesting play style, where one has to either approach or depart from the enemy at a sufficient angle to make use of at least two of your guns, while preferably avoiding being fired upon, and thus - playing on the outskirts of the main engagements. Its excellent top-speed is a huge enabler in playing such a harassing role.

Much like other fast boats, it finds a great use in contesting the capture points and flanking the enemies. On larger maps it might be beneficial to go for a more distant capture points, often these dedicated to the bluewater vessels, as the MC 485 will likely be the first vessel to arrive at the location, long before lumbering destroyers get close enough to kill you and prevent capture.

Gameplay in the MC 485 hugely benefits from regularly checking the minimap and relocating, rather than rushing towards the nearest targets, as a number of gunboats can easily outgun you in a duel.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast and very agile vessel
* Good firepower for the BR
* Very good torpedoes, which can be used even in a higher BR matches

'''Cons:'''

* Very little armour, allowing almost any calibre to penetrate it
* No forward or aft-firing guns
* No access to mines, commonly found on other Schnellboots
