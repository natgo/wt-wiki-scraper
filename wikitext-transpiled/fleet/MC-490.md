== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The MC-490 is fairly well-defended for a boat of its size. Although it does not have any armour plating, its internal modules are well-placed to increase survivability. The ammunition storage is located beneath the waterline, making detonation unlikely. One of its fuel tanks is also located below the waterline. With this protection, the MC-490 can survive a good number of hits from low-calibre guns. However, the main calibre rounds fired by destroyers and other large ships will have no difficulty in destroying or at least dealing great damage to this vessel.

With its modest 38-man crew, the Folgore finds itself in a modestly balanced position among its most common contenders. The Folgore often finds itself against the American [[89 ft PT-810]]; the German [[MZ1]]; the Soviet [[Groza]] and [[MBK pr.186]] and finally the Japanese [[Type 11]]. Of these five, the most dangerous were the PT-810 and Type 11 because with their [[Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)]] automatic cannons they are able to inflict a considerable amount of damage on the MC-490.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The propulsion is four diesel engines on four axles with a total power of 10,000 hp that allows for a speed of 65 km/h (35 knots) with a range of 629 miles.    The modernisation saw the substitution from the main previous engine type MB511 of 2,500 hp with all new types of engines called MB 518 which provided 3,000 hp for a total power of 12,000 hp, it allowes the boat to reach a speed of 38 knots with a range of 700 miles thanks to the greater quantity of embarked fuel, passed from 22 to 30 tons.

With its remarkable agility it can move the rudder from left to right in 3.5 seconds and once it has reached the maximum speed it can make a U-turn in 20 seconds.

It has a maximum speed of 66 km/h while in reverse it reaches -25 km/h. Compared to other the ships at its battle rating this is one of the slowest ships for reverse speeds, but this does not mean that it is not a good ship. Don't go backwards, go forwards!

{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)}}

The two Bofors cannons on the MC-490 are both fully traversable, and have a good traverse rate of 30 degrees per second. They are able to easily destroy any small vessel that the MC-490 may face in battle. If necessary, they can be used against destroyers, if it is not possible to use the MC-490 torpedoes, but this is less effective.

The two [[Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)]] have a great rate of fire 150 rounds per minute and can easily destroy anything within an 800 m radius.

One of the cannons is located at the bow of the ship, while the other is located at the stern. This means that it is sometimes not possible to fire both at the same target simultaneously. Engaging broadside eliminates this issue, but of course, makes the MC-490 a larger target for the enemy to hit.

{{main|W.200/450X5,75 (450 mm)}}

This vessel's four torpedoes are best used against large, slow, cumbersome targets such as destroyers, minesweepers and barges. They will do significant damage if they hit, a weak spot. Unfortunately these are the slowest (81 km/h) at this battle rating compared with the English (84 km/h) and American (85 km/h). The 4 torpedoes are positioned on the 2 sides of the ship and offer only a non-directable frontal launch.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought.

The '''MC-490''' is a light vessel, and like all smaller ships effective in more compact areas of the map, where it is easy to find cover. Using this vessel in open waters, at long range, makes it vulnerable to fire from enemy destroyers, and  provides only a little ability to fight back.

If it is necessary to engage a destroyer, flak barge or someother powerful foe, the MC-490 is equipped with four torpedoes for just this purpose. They are large enough to do significant damage if they hit, but it is often hard to use them effectively. 

The best way to make use of the vessel's torpedoes is to get very close to an enemy ship without them noticing and fire at close range.

Other than torpedoes, the MC-490 is equipped with two [[Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)|40 mm Bofors L/60 Mark 3]] cannons,  these are very effective against small boats. Not surprisingly, they do little damage against larger ships, and are best used at closer range.

The ship prefers to do broadside attacks (side attacks), so the Folgore can use all its almighty armament against the enemy. With a very little effort you can also attempt a confrontation with larger ships, such as destroyers, the 40mm can destroy the armament of the enemy ship or cause fires, which disable critical components reducing the enemy combat efficiency.   To ensure the kill  it is recommended  to use torpedoes.

The two [[Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)|40 mm Bofors L/60 Mark 3]] guns are super effective against small ships   or any ships that lack armour protection  and with a little effort are capable of shooting down even the largest of aircraft. 

Although the 40 mm Bofors are quite penalized when engaging an aircraft because they have a relatively slow horizontal swing and along with no  anti-aircraft belt..

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Good cannons at close range (2x [[Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)]].

* Loss much speed when turning.
* Easy target for enemy planes, can be killed easily with 12.7mm guns.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->[[File:Folgore P-490 2.png|thumb|'''Motocannoniera convertibile 490 (MC.490)''' ]]
The first sea trials revealed a marked tendency to raise the bow, with a consequent loss of speed due to the excessive strain, so that in order to increase the thrust of the aft area, a special "bottazzo" structure was applied in the shipyard, which resulted in an extension of the living structure towards the stern, bringing the overall length of the unit from 37.2 m to 39.4 m.

Later in 1957, in order to dampen the splashes of water generated during navigation at high speed and in slightly rough seas, at the Arsenal of Taranto shipyard located, the bridge was equipped with a plexiglass windshield and at the bow given a splash guard, to prevent the waves from splashing over and preventing the ship from gaining water. The coeval corvette Sentinel, built in the same yard had recorded similar problems.

In 1959 to 1960 ferro guides were added for twelve mines. Despite numerous changes made during the fifties, the unit did not respond in a complete way to the nautical characteristics expected at the time of design and in June 1962 entered the shipyard at the Military Arsenal of Taranto for a radical reconstruction. The transformation works ended at the end of 1963.

The armament in the new configuration saw the replacement of the [[Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)|40 mm Bofors L/60 Mark 3]] cannons, with the [[40 mm/70 Breda-Bofors type 107 (40 mm)|40 mm/70 Breda-Bofors]], the modification of the ferro guides to allow the embarkation of fourteen bottom mines, equipped with disposable trolleys, instead of twelve, while the original torpedo launchers were not embarked. The armament of the unit could not be defined as completely convertible, since the different operational predisposition did not contemplate the momentary disembarkation of weapons and equipment. A factor which was negatively reflected in this phase of use, with the displacement and encumbrance of the bridge. The configuration of the torpedo boat did not contemplate the embarkation of bottom mines, while in the configuration of the torpedo boat and minelayer torpedoes were not embarked.
[[File:Folgore P-490 1.png|thumb|'''Motocannoniera convertibile 490 (MC.490)''' ]]
The unit, which returned to service in 1964, was renamed Folgore on September 1, 1965, when the Navy abandoned the custom of indicating torpedo boats with an alphanumeric code and assigned a name to each unit of this type.

The vessel, assigned to COMOS, the motor gunboat section of the III Naval Division, was decommissioned on October 1st, 1976 and the ship was decommissioned on October 15th. The initials P-490 were assigned to the patrol boat Comandante Cigala Fulgosi of the Comandanti class.

Name and armament changes:

* In 1954, it was called '''Motocannoniera convertibile 490 (MC.490) (ENG trans. Convertible Motor Gunboat 490)'''
* In 1965, it was called '''Pattugliatore 490 (P-490) (ENG trans. Patrol boat 490)'''
