== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game. MO stands for Malyj Okhotnik, Russian for "Small Hunter".

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
MO-4 has the following structural layout:

* Hull: 38 mm, wood
* Superstructure: 10 mm, wood

The {{PAGENAME}} is not armoured at all, and can be easily destroyed by even a rank 1 ship at close range. Ammo stores lay in the front and rear of the ship, while the fuel tanks are in the centre, meaning that an enemy shot will have a good chance of hitting a critical component. The silver lining of the {{PAGENAME}}'s survivability is that the engines are below the water line, and so they are somewhat harder to hit.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility
|SpeedForwardStockAB = 49
|SpeedBackStockAB = 19
|SpeedForwardStockRB = 43
|SpeedBackStockRB = 17
}}

The MO-4 is relatively mobile for a ship of its size, with a top speed of 50 km/h in RB and 67 km/h in AB. While this is far slower than the MTBs at the same BR, it is quite adequate for a ship of its size, and is enough to get the MO-4 where it needs to be. Furthermore, the MO-4 is relatively snappy in terms of controls and turns relatively quickly, meaning that it is overall quite nimble.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|45 mm/68 21-KM (45 mm)}}

This ship has access to two manual 45 mm cannons that can use AP ammo (for use against armoured boats) and three types of HE ammo. The default one and one of the unlockable ones (OR-73A and F-73 respectively) can be used to hit distant targets due to their greater muzzle velocity. The O-240 HE shell has greater explosive filler, but lower muzzle velocity, and so is more effective at closer range.

However, these guns leave the crew exposed due to the lack of armour, so even enemy machine guns can incapacitate these guns. As such, try to stay at range to prevent this from happening.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

The anti-air armaments of the {{PAGENAME}} consist of a total of two 12.7 mm DShK machine guns. These guns should be primarily against the aircraft, which are relatively easy to take down at BR 1.7, but they can also be used against the lightly-armoured boats that are still present at this battle rating (such as the LS 3). The guns are positioned in the middle section of the ship, which should pose no problems against aircraft because at least one gun can be placed onto the enemy aircraft, but it can be hard to attack boats directly in front of the ship.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|BB-1 depth charge|M-8}}

One big firepower improvement on the {{PAGENAME}} is the ability to equip the M-8 rockets. With a total of 64 rockets (32 on the deck ready to use), this ship can destroy almost anything, armoured or not, at very close range. While this ship should not be used at close range due to the lack of protection, rockets can be used in a last ditch effort to defeat rushing enemies or if in need of a quick-reacting weapon to surprise-attack someone. Do not underestimate the psychological effect of the rockets on newer player that may try to run away, seeing/hearing them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} has dangerous long-range firepower at a very low battle rating, but limited defence against fast and evasive enemies and air power. Accordingly, the MO-4 should fight conservatively at the longest possible range the crew's gunnery skill could reach. At this battle rating, very few opponents will have large-calibre guns that can compete at range, and even fewer players will be able to target them effectively, so use that to the ship's advantage.

The MO-4 has two 45 mm cannons, with one on the bow and one on the stern. These weapons are not fully automatic, but pack a very significant punch for the battle rating. Indeed, they are very capable of ripping apart any vessels at the MO-4's BR, from larger patrol ships to smaller MTBs. Note that these weapons have a longer effective range than most other weapons that the MO-4 commonly faces, meaning that the ship can be used in a "sniper" playstyle. This means that the ship should stay 2-3 km away from any enemies, and snipe enemy light vessels using its powerful armament. This way, the MO-4 can make good use of its powerful armament without being heavily damaged by enemy vessels.

Since the MO-4 does not have good anti-air defence, with only two 12.7 mm DShK machine guns for the job, it should be used as a first spawn ship; otherwise stay close to allies with good anti-air defences to extend its lifespan. The two DShK machine guns aren't good at longer ranges due to their short effective range (~1.5 km) but are highly effective against enemy vessels at short ranges. These weapons can put out a decent amount of damage when used correctly. Finally, note that the MO-4 gets access to M-8 unguided rockets. These weapons aren't effective against fast light vessels, but are highly effective against larger, slower vessels. Feel free to use these weapons when necessary, especially if being overwhelmed at closer ranges. The rockets pack a massive punch and will easily destroy any ships the MO-4 faces.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Two large 45 mm cannons on the bow and stern of the ship
* Two secondary 12.7 mm DShK machine guns possess a good field of range, provide some air cover
* Four rocket pods on the bow of the ship deal huge damage up close and swivel to allow rockets to be fired in all directions except directly backward

'''Cons:'''

* Primary cannons have a low rate of fire
* Turrets have low turning speed
* Crew are incapacitated very easily due to lack of armour
* Good speed requires the purchase of all sea keeping modules
* Wooden hull can easily catch on fire

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The MO-4 (Russian: ÐœÐ°Ð»Ñ‹Ð¹ ÐžÑ…Ð¾Ñ‚Ð½Ð¸Ðº, Malyj Okhotnik, English: Small Hunter) was a class of small submarine chasers built by the Soviet navy during the Second World War. The ships were designed for anti-submarine warfare as well as coastal patrol, though their duties varied during the course of the Second World War. The MO-4 class was the most numerous variant of the basic MO design, with approximately 250 ships built. The ships were built between 1937 and 1943, and served extensively during the Second World War.

The MO-4 was the 4th development of the MO class of guard ships, following the MO-1, MO-2 and MO-3 classes. However, in terms of production size, it dwarfed the previous classes, with roughly 250 ships produced compared to roughly 40 ships of the previous three classes. The MO-4s sported a main armament of two 45 mm 21-K cannons, one each mounted fore and aft of the bridge. As well, the ship carried two single DShK heavy machine guns. The MO-4 class sub-chasers were not fitted with torpedo armament, but rather, depth charges for it's anti-submarine role.

The MO-4 class of sub chasers saw extensive duty during the Second World War, not only in its anti-submarine role, but in various other roles as well. The ships were designed to be small and versatile, and as such, they were used for a variety of purposes including convoy escort and landing support. Two MO type sub chasers (MO-103 and MO-144) sank one U-Boat each, while other MO-4 boats destroyed small surface ships and aircraft. The MO-4 class would also lend its design to the later BMO (the B standing for "armoured"), of which 66 were produced in 1945.
