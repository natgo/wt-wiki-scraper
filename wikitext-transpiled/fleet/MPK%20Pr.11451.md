== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet motor torpedo gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The MPK Pr.11451's armour is not the best as it will only reliably protect against small arms fire from the reserve boats that are common in the battles you'll be fighting. Its crew count of 36 also should not be relied upon to protect you but they are more widely distributed compared to its predecessor.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
As a hydrofoil, the MPK Pr.11451 is an extremely fast boat, capable of reaching speeds of up to 120 km/h once spaded. However that also makes it hard to manoeuvre once it reaches high speeds.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Being essentially an [[MPK Pr.12412]] on hydrofoils, the Pr.11451 may be played like one. Early in matches, the Mukha can be used to capture points before the enemy does thanks to its speed, and its 76 mm gun can be used to deter boats (i.e. the [[LS 3]] and [[G-5]]) from taking your place. Later on in these matches, you can act as an anti-aircraft boat, utilising your 30 mm gun and search radar to shred planes to pieces thanks to its extremely high fire rate.
Bear in mind that the torpedoes, having a weak explosive filler compared to others, should not be relied upon to take down larger ships unless you are at point-blank range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Fast, at 120 km/h when spaded
* Robust armament suite
* Has access to a radar

'''Cons:'''
* Large target
* The huge size of its hydrofoils means it can't access shallow areas
* Completely outclassed against destroyers
* Torpedoes have a low explosive filler
* Can face heavy cruisers like the [[Prinz Eugen]]

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In 1984, construction began on a new type of small anti-submarine boat for the USSR. Project 11451 boats, thanks to their high speed, towed sonar array and powerful weapons, were supposed to search for enemy submarines. A group of several of these boats could very quickly move to an area for the chosen search, carry out the search and if necessary, quickly move to new coordinates. Despite the planned large series of MPKs, only two Project 11451 boats were able to be fully completed before the collapse of the Soviet Union.
