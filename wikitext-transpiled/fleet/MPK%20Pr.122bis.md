== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet sub-chaser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]] as a reward for the 2019 [[wt:en/news/6145-special-battlefield-engineer-en|"Battlefield Engineer"]] crafting event.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The MPK Pr.122bis has a good armour, her most well defended zone is at the centre and her most vulnerable area is the primary weapon. The ammo magazines are not much of a problem because they are well protected.

The crew size of the boat is 60 sailors, which is consequent and makes it hard to knock out the boat just with crew depletion.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The MPK Pr. 122bis has mediocre mobility at best. The ship can nominally make 39 km/h maximum forward speed in Realistic, though the actual operating speed of the vehicle will typically be lower. The ship's turning circle and rudder shift time are all rather inadequate, meaning that the ship takes a long time to accelerate and turn. As a result, captains of the MPK Pr. 122bis must always stay alert, as the ship must take early evasive action to avoid any torpedoes or obstacles.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|90-K (85 mm)}}

The primary weapon on the {{PAGENAME}} is the [[90-K (85 mm)|85 mm 90-K]] cannon. A good gun in its own right that only really needs high-explosive shells to handle most of its opponents. Due to the cannon's ability, most battles may only require up to 100 shells to be brought in for the match. The gun has great frontal firing arcs, reaching all the way to the ship's sides to nigh-rear, with the ±160° horizontal traverse range. However, the slow traverse speed means that the {{PAGENAME}} shouldn't expect to fight enemies coming in at all sides.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)}}

The secondary armament on the {{PAGENAME}} is two 37 mm 70-K automatic guns. With the two placed in the rear, they provide enough firepower to compensate the 85 mm cannon's inability to attack towards the ship's stern. Carrying a full complement of explosive shells can help take care of any boats and planes trying to attack from the ship's stern.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

The tertiary armament of the {{PAGENAME}} are three turrets of dual-mounted DShK machine guns, one in the front and two in the rear. Though not as powerful as the 37 mm 70-K guns, these machine guns help supplement the firepower against approaching boats and planes.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->

''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.''

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Pr. 122bis can be thought of and played as a heavier armed, less manoeuvrable version of the tech tree [[MPK pr. 122A|Pr. 122A]] or the [[MPK-163]]. Make use of the ship's massive armament to pulverize any boats that dare get in your way.

The Pr. 122bis has lacking manoeuvrability, meaning that it isn't particularly effective at rushing to bases or charging into battle. Instead, one good strategy is to find a good piece of cover (i.e. a small island) to protect the ship's more vulnerable central section. If you just leave the ship's bow sticking out, most enemy ships won't be able to damage your main section. This leaves the powerful frontal 85 mm cannon exposed, allowing you to engage enemy ships with ease.

However, this strategy doesn't allow usage of the ship's powerful secondary and AA armament suite, which offers a second gameplay option: serving as a brawler or mid-ranged gunship. This strategy maximizes the Pr. 122bis's high crew count and powerful armament spread across the vessel. When doing so, utilize the ship's powerful 85 mm gun to engage heavier targets (such as the [[SC-497]]) and utilize the 37 mm automatic cannons to engage smaller, faster targets. The 37 mm guns are also highly effective against enemy aircraft, capable of destroying most enemy aircraft with a couple of hits at most.

When playing the MPK Pr. 122bis, always stay aware of your surroundings. The ship's lacking manoeuvrability may prevent it from dodging a torpedo if the torpedo isn't noticed early enough. As well, pay attention to enemy ships in the vicinity, particularly heavier-armed vessels such as the [[SF40 Leichte|SF40]] series anti-air ferries. These vessels typically carry numerous hard-hitting automatic guns which will quickly destroy the ship's crew.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 85 mm main gun, capable of firing powerful HE shells with 700+ grams of explosive filler
* Extremely potent secondary armament of 37 mm cannons and 12.7 mm machine guns, which are wonderful at destroying soft targets such as boats and aircraft
* Large crew complement of 60 crew members, giving the ship good survivability
* Relatively long hull meaning that crew is more spread out - this increases the ship's survivability by making it harder to knock out compartments
* Premium bonuses allow it to speed up research of the Soviet coastal fleet tree
** As it is a premium vessel, all modifications are unlocked by default.

'''Cons:'''

* Lacking manoeuvrability including a long rudder shift, large turning circle and inadequate top speed for a boat of its size
* The ship's hull isn't armoured at all, meaning that the vital components can be hit very easily
* Ammunition storages and engines all lie partially above the waterline, meaning that they can be hit and destroyed easily
* Main gun is incapable of firing behind the ship, limiting its effectiveness in certain situations

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The significantly upgraded version of the Project 122 small patrol boats designated Project 122bis MASB has been evaluated by experts as one of the most successful models in its class in the Soviet navy. This version varies from the Project 122 and 122A versions due to its new powertrain, differently-constructed cabin and enhanced anti-air weapons (aft 37 mm autocannons), as well as other improvements. The Soviet navy began employing the RGB-12 rocket-powered bomb against enemy subs in 1953. In later versions, the boats of Project 122bis had bomb launchers mounted on their forward sections for firing these rocket-powered bombs – two rail-type launchers with a constant firing arc that could be aimed horizontally by correcting the ship's course. The Soviet navy used the submarine chasers of Project 122bis until the late 60s, and they also exported them to many other countries.
