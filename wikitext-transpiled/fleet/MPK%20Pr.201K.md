== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet sub-chaser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Winged Lions"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7469-event-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2021 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R.]] event.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The MPK Pr.201K virtually has no armour, only protected by steel on the hull and the superstructure. The only armour it has located on her 2 x 25 mm turret. It can withstand any small arms and some heavy machine gun fire, but it is are vulnerable to autocannon fire. With only 29 crew, it's surprisingly survivable. Be careful with the front hull because all of the ammo is located at the front of the ship's hull. Hide the front hull or you will be destroyed instantly.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
For a sub-chaser, the MPK Pr.201K is somewhat quick. With 52 km/h forward and 20 km/h in reverse (RB/SB), you can flank and go behind cover to surprise other boats and sometimes some unaware PT boat with the rapid-firing twin 25 mm and 45 mm autocannons.

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|45 mm/89 SM-21-ZIF (45 mm)}}

The 45 mm/89 SM-21-ZIF is a fast-firing high-velocity cannon naval autocannon. Little prone to overheating, it can shred PT boat and lightly-armoured ship pretty quickly. It only has one type of ammo and doesn't have AP rounds, making it harder to fight heavier targets like armoured gun boats and destroyers. The superstructure blocks your firing arc, making the 45 mm useless if the enemy is directly at your boat's front.

If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2M-3 (25 mm)}}

The 25 mm 2M-3 is a common naval autocannon among Soviet naval ships. It's good against lightly-armoured target and PT boats. It can also be used as AA defense with the 45 mm as well. You also can't shoot the 25 mm if the enemy is directly in front of your boat because the front hull and mortar block the cannon's line of sight.

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|RBU-1200|YAM-43 mine}}

The MPK Pr.201K is equipped with 60 RBU-1200 rocket-propelled depth charges, each containing a warhead with a 32 kg of explosive material. These can be launched in a salvo of 20 depth charges, effectively targeting enemy boats or even larger vessels like destroyers. However, it's important to note that the launcher lacks horizontal guidance, necessitating adjustment of the boat's hull to aim the launcher accurately. Additionally, the limited range of approximately 1km makes it challenging to hit enemy vessels successfully.

The boat also carries 20 YAM-43 Coastal Mines, each containing 20 kg of explosive material. These mines can be strategically deployed to impede enemy movement into vital areas, such as capture points. By placing these mines along the common routes that enemies typically take, you can effectively obstruct their progress. These mines are particularly effective against enemy destroyers due to their larger size, as opposed to smaller boats which have a better chance of evading mines if spotted.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Being a sub-chaser in War Thunder can be hit or miss due to the absence of submarines in the game. However, this boat's impressive armament offers the opportunity to adapt its role as a Boat Hunter. With its 45 mm autocannon and twin 25 mm autocannons, it's well-equipped to dismantle enemy PT boats and other lightly armored vessels. The Coastal Mines are valuable for obstructing enemy movement into key areas, strategically placed where enemy vessels are expected to pass. The Depth Charges are suitable for engaging enemy destroyers, although their effectiveness hinges on hitting the target, which can be challenging due to aiming difficulties and limited launch range.

Given its lack of armor, it's advisable not to immediately rush to the frontline. Instead, attempt a flanking approach to catch enemy boats off guard, enabling you to use your autocannons effectively from their sides. Your 45 mm and twin 25 mm armament can swiftly neutralize opponents. Be cautious not to expose the front of your hull, as it houses your ammunition.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Impressive cannon firepower capable of obliterating enemy boats and other lightly armored vessels
* Decent mobility for a sub-chaser
* Coastal mines can effectively obstruct enemy pathways to key areas
* Can perform anti-aircraft duties when enemy aircraft are approaching 

*

'''Cons:'''

* Both autocannons can only be fired sideways

After World War II, the [[MPK Pr.122bis|Pr.122]] continued to serve in the role of a sub-chaser. However, over time, complaints arose that the vessel was too sluggish and heavy for this duty, no longer effectively fulfilling its role in detecting and intercepting post-war submarines. In response to these concerns, the development of a new sub-chaser began in 1947. Numerous designs were submitted, and only a handful were selected, most of which were lighter and faster than their predecessor.

In 1955, the first two prototypes, named the Pr.201, were constructed. Initially, these prototypes were equipped with a 45 mm SM-21-ZIF cannon at the front and two 25 mm 2M-3 cannons at the rear. To counter submarines, they were outfitted with a quantity of BM-1 depth charges.

However, during trials, certain flaws with the vessel became evident. One issue was structural instability caused by the unbalanced weight distribution, making the hull susceptible to snapping during rough waves. To address this, the 45mm SM-21-ZIF cannon was repositioned to the back, leaving only one 25mm 2M-3 cannon at the front. Subsequent developments involved replacing the five M-50 engines with three 37D diesel engines, equipping the front of the vessel with four RBU-1200 rocket-propelled depth charges instead of the traditional BM-1 depth charges, and adding the capability to carry YAM-43 coastal mines. This evolved version was designated the Pr.201 modification K, or the Pr.201K.

A total of ten Pr.201K vessels were produced between 1957 and 1958. Recognizing that the autocannon wasn't as crucial for anti-submarine tasks, the navy replaced the 45 mm autocannon with another 25 mm 2M-3 autocannon. This modification rendered the vessel slightly lighter and faster, leading to its designation as the [[MPK Pr.201M|Pr.201M]].
