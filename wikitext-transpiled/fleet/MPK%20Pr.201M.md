== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The MPK Pr.201M is a successor to the [[MPK Pr.122bis]] and the most produced model among all the MPK Pr.201 series, with around 200 being built. Although it was constructed in large numbers, it did not satisfy the sailors due to its maximum speed, which was insufficient to intercept post-war submarines. It was later replaced by the [[MPK Pr.204]] in the 1960s. However, it remained in service with the Border Guards until 1991.

This vessel was introduced during the [[Update "Ground Breaking"]]. Its gameplay remains the same as the previous model, the [[MPK Pr.201K]], utilizing two twin 25 mm autocannons for destroying lightly armoured targets. The ship is also capable of carrying coastal mines, allowing it to effectively block certain key areas.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The MPK Pr.201M has virtually no armour, only being protected by steel on the hull and the superstructure. The only armour it possesses is located on its two twin 25 mm turrets. It can withstand small arms fire and some heavy machine gun fire, but it is vulnerable to autocannon fire. Despite having only 29 crew members, it has surprisingly good survivability. However, you should be cautious with the front hull because all of the ammo is located there. Conceal the front hull or you risk being destroyed instantly.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The MPK Pr.201M is quite fast, boasting a speed of 52 km/h forward and 20 km/h in reverse (RB/SB). This speed allows you to flank the enemy and seek cover to catch other boats by surprise, sometimes even catching unaware PT boats off guard with its two rapid-firing twin 25 mm autocannons.

{{main|2M-3 (25 mm)}}

The 25 mm 2M-3 is a common naval autocannon found on many Soviet naval ships. It is effective against lightly-armoured targets and PT boats and can also serve as anti-aircraft defense. However, it's important to exercise caution because you cannot fire the 25 mm cannon if the enemy is directly in front of your boat, as the bridge and rocket launcher block the cannon's line of sight.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|YAM-43 mine|RBU-1200}}

The MPK Pr.201M is equipped with 60 RBU-1200 rocket-propelled depth charges, each containing a warhead with 32 kg of explosive material. These depth charges can be launched in a salvo of 20, effectively targeting enemy boats or even larger vessels like destroyers. However, it's important to note that the launcher lacks horizontal guidance, requiring adjustments to the boat's hull to accurately aim the launcher. Additionally, the limited range of approximately 1 km makes it challenging to successfully hit enemy vessels.

The boat also carries 20 YAM-43 coastal mines, each containing 20 kg of explosive material. These mines can be strategically deployed to obstruct enemy movement into vital areas, such as capture points. Placing these mines along common enemy routes can effectively impede their progress. These mines are particularly effective against enemy destroyers due to their larger size, while smaller boats have a better chance of evading mines if spotted.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MPK Pr.201M, although designed as a sub-chaser, finds itself in a unique role in War Thunder due to the absence of submarines. Its impressive armament, consisting of two twin 25 mm autocannons, allows it to excel as a Boat Hunter. These autocannons make it well-suited for dismantling enemy PT boats and other lightly armoured vessels. The coastal mines prove valuable for obstructing enemy movement in key areas, strategically placed where enemy vessels are expected to pass. The depth charges, while suitable for engaging enemy destroyers, pose a challenge due to aiming difficulties and limited launch range.

Given its lack of armour, it's advisable not to rush to the frontline immediately. Instead, attempt a flanking approach to catch enemy boats off guard, enabling you to use your autocannons effectively from their sides. Your two twin 25 mm armaments can swiftly neutralize opponents. Be cautious not to expose the front of your hull, as it houses your ammunition.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Impressive autocannon firepower capable of obliterating enemy boats and other lightly armoured vessels
* Decent mobility for a sub-chaser
* Coastal mines can effectively obstruct enemy pathways to key areas
* Can perform anti-aircraft duties when enemy aircraft are approaching

'''Cons:'''

* These autocannons can only be fired sideways
* The utilization of depth charges presents significant difficulty

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In 1957-1958, a total of 10 [[MPK Pr.201K]] boats were delivered to the navy for field testing and evaluation. After the navy's assessment, they identified necessary and unnecessary changes that needed adjustment before mass production could begin.

The project's revisions included modifications to the hull, as well as changes to the armament and equipment. To reduce top weight, the decision was made to replace the 45mm SM-21-ZIF mount with the same 25mm 2M-3 mount found on the bow. This not only saved weight but also simplified and standardized the fire control for the ship. This improved version also received more advanced radar, transmission, identification equipment, and sonar.

A total of 160 MPK Pr.201M boats were built and delivered to the navy and the Border Guard between 1958 and 1967, with around 60 more being constructed for export.

In 1964, the Kerch Shipyard tested an improved version of the MPK Pr.201, named Pr.201T. It was equipped with two 400 mm torpedo launchers for SET-40 anti-submarine torpedoes. However, it didn't meet the navy's expectations due to its slow speed, which limited the effective use of torpedoes. Post-war submarines had improved to the point where the MPK Pr.201M couldn't effectively intercept them, leading to its gradual replacement by more advanced ships like the [[MPK Pr.204]].

In the end, some MPK Pr.201M boats were sold to other nations, while others remained in service and were transferred to the Border Guards, serving until 1991.
