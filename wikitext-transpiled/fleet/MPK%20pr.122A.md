== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet sub-chaser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

Due to its large size and decent crew, this is a difficult boat to sink. The whole vessel is unarmoured except for the gun shield, meaning that machinery and ammunition are left exposed. Although magazine explosions are rare, it's common for both the gun and engine to be knocked out, either of which will spell disaster for this vessel. Fortunately, due to its size, the crew is spread out and there are more compartments to disable, increasing your life expectancy greatly.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The boat is reasonably fast in a straight line, able to keep up with slower PT boats and outpace German minesweepers. However, turning is awful due to large hull length. The boat tends to spin, meaning the stern will hit rocks or the shoreline if sailed too close. Stopping distance is also a problem, with no easy way to escape trouble once you've found it. All in all, it has decent mobility, adequate for the role, but it does have some shortcomings to be mindful of.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|34-K (76 mm)}}

Primary armament consists of a single rapid fire 76 mm gun positioned on the bow, which is able to shred smaller boats in a few hits while holding its own against larger vessels. The gun is protected by steel plate, however due to its position, it will often get knocked out by enemy fire.

HE is deadly against small and medium-sized vessels, disabling compartments in one or two hits. While AP is good for armoured targets such as the Soviet gunboats, it will over-penetrate most vehicles this boat will face.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

Secondary armaments that also double for anti-air duties on the vessel are the three 12.7 mm DShK heavy machine guns in single mounts at the stern. While they may be classed as combined AA/auxiliaries, they are only really useful for engaging aerial targets. Due to the location of the guns, they have decent firing arcs and have no problem tracking low flying aircraft. Optimal range for these guns is less than a kilometer, where their combined fire will easily down any aircraft that loiter in the vicinity, while gunners will start opening up from 2 km away.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|BM-1 small depth charge|BB-1 depth charge}}

While depth charges and bomb throwers can be equipped, they are mostly useless and should only be used in specific situations, otherwise concentrate on using the guns.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
(AB) The ship should be pointed towards the bow (front) at all times, greatly increasing survivability, and used to hunt smaller PT boats with the 76 mm cannon while staying away from larger ships with bigger or more numerous guns. While this boat isn't immune to PT boats, they are its primary target, and parking the boat behind cover near a cap allows you to mop up any intruders. Particular enemies to note are:

* Well-armed American PT boats (PT-314, etc.)
* British and Soviet gunboats (SGB, Fairmile, MPK-163)
* German barges (SF40's or AF D1's)
* British Isles/Flower-class boats
* Also large, tough bombers such as the Catalina or Wellington will break through your air defence, try to keep moving and not make yourself an easy target.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Rapid-fire cannon, which deals decent damage
* Self-defence AA is capable of shooting down planes at short range (1 km or closer)
* Fast in a straight line
* Good survivability

'''Cons:'''

* Auxiliary armament of 3 heavy machine guns are mostly ineffective against other ships, and A.I. Gunners tend to be inefficient
* Big turning circle and big length mean difficulty traversing in tight spaces - beware of running aground
* Cannon does get knocked out easily

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
