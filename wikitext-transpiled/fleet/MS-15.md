== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The MS-15's armour consists of 40 mm of wood in the hull and the structure is 15 mm of wood. This ship can be easily destroyed by HE belts. For the survivability, the MS-15 has a crew of 19 people, which can easily be decimated by other ships. Don't engage enemies in a head-on.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The MS-15 is powered by three Isotta Fraschini "ASSO" engines that provides 52 km/h of speed (Upgraded 61 km/h). The turning speed and manoeuvrability are good for its BR, which helps eavade shots.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)}}

As main armament, the MS-15 uses two 20 mm 20/65 Breda cannons, seen previously on the VAS 201 and other ships. These cannons cause little damage and is divided into magazines, every 12 shots the cannon will reload. This is a bad thing in rough seas as it will be difficult to hit the targets with the available shots before having to reload.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 270/533X6.84 Tipo L (533 mm)|S.I.270 (533 mm)|B TG depth charge}}

The MS-15 can at best carry the following additional armament:

* Two Torpedoes S.I.270
* Two Torpedoes W.200/450X5,75
* Twelve B TG'

The Torpedoes S.I.270 have a maximum speed of 93 km/h (81 km/h with torpedo mode), 270kg of explosive and a range of 4 Km (8 Km with torpedo mode).

The depth charges B TG have 50 Kg of Explosive, they can be used very well when you are against a better-armoured but much slower opponent.

Remember to use your torpedoes in a good time because you have only 2 and they don't have a very long range.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MS-15 is a normal fighting motor boat. Its biggest disadvantages are the small magazines for the main armament and no protection whatsoever. 

It is a good rapid ship for its battle rating, the best advice is to not attack frontally or go into the mouth of the enemy. Go around them and shoot them from the side. Bring two different belts for dealing with different scenarios, one AP belt for fighting tough, armoured targets, and the on HE belt for fighting more thin-skinned ships. For dealing with larger vessels, use the torpedoes for a quick way to destroy them, although use the torpedoes only when certain they will hit or reach the target as the torpedoes have a rather limited range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good speed (61 km/h)
* Good rotation time 
* Good torpedoes

'''Cons:'''

* No armour
* The 20 mm cannons have small magazines and a slow rate of fire
* Terrible survivability (compared to other ships)
* No anti-aircraft

The Italian {{Annotation|Motosiluranti|Torpedo Boat}} (MS) are medium-sized ships, with good manoeuvrability, speed and with the property of carrying torpedoes to destroy ships, particularly large ones.

The Italian designers and admirals tried to obtain the design plans of the Lürseen motor torpedo boats, that is [[S-38]], [[S-38b]] and [[S-100]]. They did not succeed and therefore decide to reverse-engineer the vehicles, adapting the new hulls to tested construction techniques and using three Isotta Fraschini "ASSO" engines that guaranteed a speed of not more than 32.5 knots.

In 1941, the 1st Group was created with 18 units of 62 Tons boats ordered from CRDA of Monfalcone. These boats were armed with two torpedo launchers of 533 mm, two 20 mm cannons and depth charges. The boats were numbered MS-11 in groups of 6 and every 6 units was a squadron of torpedo motorboats delivered in 1942.

In the unit formed by MS-16 and MS-22, they are well known for sinking the British light cruiser HMS Manchester during the battle in mid-August 1942

In 1942-1943, the 2nd Group was created with 18 new units, starting from MS-51 onwards. These boats were larger, armed with 2 x 533 mm and 2 x 450 mm torpedo launchers, with more depth charges and 2 x 20 mm guns.

After WW2, the surviving MSs in the years 1960-1962 were refitted with new armaments such as 40 mm Bofors and other armaments. These upgraded versions were designated the MS-472, MS-473 and others.

They were retired from service in 1975 and eventually disbarred in 1979.

=== History of the MS-15 ===
[[File:MS-15.png|thumb|MS-15 during sail]]
MS-15 was one of the boats within the 1st Group and as such was created in the first series production.

In service in 1942, it was sunk in October 1943, during the co-belligerence, by German air attack in the port of Leros in the Egeo Sea.

=== [[wt:en/news/6706-development-the-ms-15-italian-navy-coming-to-war-thunder-en|Devblog]] ===
In the early years of WWII, the Italian Navy realized the drawbacks of the MAS series of torpedo boats. Namely, the vessels of this type boasted excellent speeds, but had less than ideal seaworthiness. As a result, the Regia Marina began looking into procuring a vessel that would address this problem in the early 1940s.

The answer quickly came with the fall of Yugoslavia and the subsequent seizure of their limited naval force by the Italians. Having found older German-built Schnellboots of the Lürssen type, the Italians soon came to the conclusion that these vessels ideally fitted the current needs of the navy. As such, the captured examples were taken back to Italy and a nigh identical design was derived from them by the shipbuilder CRDA. The design, designated CRDA 60t, only differed in the powerplant choice as well as featuring Italian weaponry, while the rest remained virtually identical to the original.

The first of the CRDA 60t torpedo boats were completed by April of 1942, of which a total of 36 would be built. The CRDA 60t torpedo boats first saw action during WW2 in summer of the same year. One of the most notable successes of their early service career was the fatal injuring of the British light cruiser HMS Manchester, followed by sinking by British ships, caused by MS 16 and MS 22 in August of 1942, also marking the largest target to be destroyed by any motor torpedo boat during WWII.

Some vessels of the type also served with the Kriegsmarine, particularly those which were captured by the Germans following the signing of the armistice in September of  1943. Of the 36 CRDA 60t torpedo boats, 16 were lost in action during the war. Many surviving units continued serving with the Italian Navy postwar and well into the Cold War, thanks to modernization programs. A handful of the surviving units were also handed over to the French and Soviet Navies respectively under the armistice treaty conditions. The last of the highly modernized CRDA 60t torpedo boats was decommissioned as late as 1979, marking the end of a 37-year service career.
