== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
Built with the nomenclature MS 31, launched on June 18, 1942, completed and commissioned in the 2ndSquadron on June 24, 1942, she was already sent to the Sicilian Channel where she participated in several operations against the British Navy, one of the most special operations were during the Battle of Mid-August, but not only participated in the ambush south of Ras Mustafa in which she destroyed a British ship, in 1943 after the Italian armistice she was part of the Italian Co-Belligerent Navy in which she helped the Allies in special missions one of which most famous was the recovery of British saboteurs in Fano where she destroyed an enemy train, after World War II in 1957 she was put under modernization, where the engine was replaced with a more powerful one and the change of the two 20mm Breda with two 40mm Bofors, she was renamed MS 473, but during this era the ship would perform training and coastal control activities, only to be removed from Service in Taranto on December 1, 1974, she was transferred to Venice and is now on display at the Venice Nautical History Museum.

The MS-473 added in the game with the Italian Naval Tech Tree in the [[Update "Starfighters"|"Starfighters" update,]]  is a torpedo boat of two single Bofors 40mm emplacements very well manages to inflict damage to almost any naval air enemy, as additional armament it carries only 8 depth charges quite useless which however when you manage to find a naval target close enough to you you can use them to cause serious flaws or the immediate destruction of the enemy ship, the manoeuvrability and speed is not bad at all, it is quite good you will manage to dodge enemy strikes quite well, the survivability is comparable to all other ships of the CRDA 60(t) class.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The survival of MS-473 mainly is not one of the best but still, it can withstand various damage from enemies up to 40mm calibre, after this calibre it is easily destroyed by anything it is not to be used in confrontation but flank enemy boats and ships, the armour itself is almost the same as all other CRDA 60(t) boats.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The speed of the MS-473 is quite good, and thanks to its manoeuvrability that gives you the ability to curve quickly you can dodge several hits from enemy ships, the acceleration is also not bad.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)}}

The main armament consists of only two single 40mm guns positioned one in the front and one in the back of the Motor gun boat, this armament is pier good against almost any enemy target, thanks to the selection of shots and penetration, the belt HE very useful for destroying light targets such as other coastal ships and enemy aircraft, while the belt AP even though it causes little damage can penetrate even motor torpedo boats and damage them the main advice is to target the engines to remove the enemy crew faster

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|B TG 100 depth charge}}

The only additional armament that the MS-473 carries are depth charges that are very useless because of the speed of your vehicle and your survivability, but if you happen to have a naval enemy very close to you use them because they will be able to destroy them quickly or create a hole in them that is difficult to repair.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
MS-473 unlike the [[MS-472]] doesn't carry torpedoes which are very useful for any naval target so you'll have to watch out for enemy destroyers and ships with good survivability because your two 40mm don't kill instantly you'll need some time to destroy the enemy target in fact you'll aim to destroy more at enemy coastal ships, instead you need to start learning how to shoot at enemy aircraft being that you are only equipped with main armament then controlled by you, but it is not just the difference of the lack of torpedoes, in fact the MS-473 carries 8 '''''[[B TG 100 depth charge|B TG 100]]''''' depth charges instead of torpedoes, these charges are always useful against any enemy ship and manages to create holes in the hull of enemy ships that take a long time to be closed, this will be your only armament against ships much larger than you, in the end always try to go out suddenly and shoot at the enemy never frontal collision because if not you can not use the second 40mm in your possession, and remember to check the tide during the game because if you find it calm you will not have problems to aim at the enemy instead if it is moved it will be much more difficult and you will have to adjust your speed to be able to aim well.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Adeguate armament
* Effective speed and acceleration

*

'''Cons:'''

* No torpedoes
* Mediocre survivability

=== '''MS 31''' ===
Launched on June 18, 1942, CRDA at Monfacone, built and commissioned on June 24, 1942, was assigned to the 2°Squadriglia, transferred to bases in the Sicilian Channel in late July 1942, in the same month specifically on the 12th and 13th participated in operations against the British convoy bound for Malta during the Battle of Mid-August, on the night of August 13, 1943, MS 31, under the command of Lt. Calvani, was in an ambush south of Ras Mustafa, which had intercepted a signal to discover MS 22, found an enemy formation just south of Kelibia, was spotted by enemy ships and retreated only to later attack from 700 meters with torpedoes, the targets whose torpedoes were fired were a destroyer and a steamer, the only target to be hit being the steamer Glenorchy which sank soon after.

Between 1942 and 1943 it participated in various attack, rescue and escort operations, on the date of the armistice MS 31 was in Taranto and remained stationed at that base until October 10, 1943, on the same date it moved to Brindisi joining the reconstituted 1°Flottiglia Motosiluranti, also in the same month with MS 33 and MS 74, it was stationed in Termoli from where it began operations against the Germans in the Adriatic, in which it participated until the spring of 1945.

On the evening of June 19, 1944, under the command of Vessel Scialdone, together with MS 64 she carried out a daring operation to land and recover British saboteurs near Fano. Having carried out the release and recovery of the saboteurs, who had undermined the coastal railroad, she together with MS 64 carried out a firing action against a stationary German military train near the beach, MS 64 and MS 31 fired for a good 5 minutes in which they caused the tank car full of gasoline to explode, and numerous fires on the train after ceasing fire the two units pulled out and headed for Termoli, where they returned the next morning.

After the end of WW2, even though they were to be handed over to the U.S. because of the Peace Treaty, she remained in service with the Italian Navy, after a certain period of inactivity, she became part of the Coastal Forces Group, being employed for exercises in the Adriatic, later transferred to the dependencies of the Gruppo Forze Costiere, in 1957, together with the MS 24, she went into reserve and put under modernization.

=== MS 473 ===
Before modernization and Italy's entry into NATO, the ship was classified MV-613, after entry renamed MS 613 and eventually after the radiation of the old destroyed units it was named MS 473.

After World War II in 1957 together with MS 24 she was put under modernization, modernization decided by the General Staff consisted only of some modifications to the hull and outfitting, embarkation of new more powerful engines specifically CRM 185-ASM of 1500 HP and eventually outfitting with more modern and efficient armaments.

The MS 473 was modernized by removing 2 front 553mm torpedo launchers, and 2 side 450mm pulse launchers, the 20/65mm Breda towers present in the torpedo boat were replaced with single 40mm Bofors guns.

After various training activities and coastal control missions, MS-473 was decommissioned in Taranto on Dec. 1, 1974, and transferred to the reserve, was not scrapped instead was repainted and placed in the Naval Historical Museum in Venice.
