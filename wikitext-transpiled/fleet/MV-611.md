== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
Built as MS-11, the boat was launched on January 31, 1942, and completed and commissioned on April 29, 1942. It was deployed to North Africa on September 3, 1942, where it operated alongside [[MS-15]]. Their mission was to transport a squadron of Guastatori (combat engineers) of the San Marco Regiment from Marsa Matruk to a location near the port of Alexandria. They also conducted anti-submarine surveillance and naval ambush operations with other units. Following the Armistice of Italy on September 8, 1943, MS-11 became part of the 1st Motor Torpedo Squadron stationed in Leros. However, on September 26, 1943, it suffered severe damage from a German air attack. To prevent it from sinking, the crew intentionally ran the boat aground on the beach. After World War II, MS-11 underwent modernization and conversion into a motor gunboat equipped with six 20 mm positions and renamed as MV-611 (MV stands for '''M'''oto '''V'''edetta, in english patrol boat). From 1958, it was deployed in Magdalena for cadet training until it was replaced by MS-444 in 1964. MV-611 was ultimately decommissioned on May 1, 1965.

Introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]], the MV-611 is a motor gunboat armed with six 20 mm Breda guns. It is capable of inflicting significant damage to enemy coastal vessels. However, it should be noted that the MV-611 is vulnerable to enemy strikes due to its CRDA 60(t) hull, which is not particularly armoured. Nevertheless, the boat offers good speed and manoeuvrability. The best strategy for operating these boats is to flank the enemy and avoid head-on engagements.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
With a crew of just 22 people and absolutely no armour, the MV-611 will not be able to survive much, if anything. As the battle rating of the ship is high enough to face reserve destroyers, this can become a huge problem, as they can easily knock you out.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
With a top speed of 61 km/h (Realistic battles) or 82 km/h (Arcade battles), it certainly isn't the slowest ship around. You can keep pace with quite a few torpedo boats and leave sub-chasers and other patrol craft in the dust. Rudder shift time is quite good and it can turn easily. In terms of manoeuvrability, it's definitely a "light gunboat".

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->

The MV-611 has 6 x 20 mm Breda autocannons, seen on Italian ships all the way from the reserves. They have tiny clips, a low rate of fire, and don't inflict a lot of damage. On the plus side, they reload extremely fast and their positioning allows you to use at least 3 guns on any surface or air target, depending on their direction. The fast reload time can allow you to dish out an almost unending stream of bullets downrange.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The MV-611's playstyle is incredibly dependent on the match's top battle rating - when it is top tier, it can easily shred through the small, wooden hulled boats of 1.3-1.7 with its 6 autocannons, but when uptiered to 3.3, it becomes next to useless against the mighty destroyers, as the guns lack the damage to sink one in a short enough time. Your best bet is to take out the destroyer's main armaments and run away before he repairs. Overall, the MV-611 can be incredibly fun or incredibly stressful, depending on the match.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* 6 x 20 mm Breda autocannons
* Decently fast
* When downtiered, can perform exceptionally well

'''Cons:'''

* No armour
* Low survivability
* Can face destroyers and is hopeless against them

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
After the Second World War, of the initial 36 units of the 'CRDA 60t' type, 14 remained, of which 4 were destined for the USSR and 1 for France due to the 1947 Peace Treaty prohibiting Italy from owning and operating units belonging to the torpedo boat category.

After the Reconstruction of the Italian Navy, thanks to the American and British motor torpedo boats named GIS (Galleggianti Inseguimento Siluri = Floats Pursuit Torpedoes), the "CRDA 60t" type ships were reclassified MV (Motovedetta = Patrol boat) and with this classification they were to remove all torpedoes present in the MVs but this was not done on all of them for the simple reason that Italy at that time joined NATO and because of the increased tension in the Eastern front.

In 1952, when the peace clauses were declared null and void, the MVs were reclassified as torpedo boats and finally, in 1954, assumed the new and definitive characteristics MS 471-475 and MS 481-484.
