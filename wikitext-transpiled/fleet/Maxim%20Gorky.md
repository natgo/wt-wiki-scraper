== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Starfighters"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6808-special-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-2020-en|2020 Operation S.U.M.M.E.R.]] event.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
'''Armour scheme:'''

* 150 mm rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) around the bridge and elevator
* 70 mm RHA at the citadel
* 70 mm RHA on the front of each main turret
* 50 mm RHA on the sides and rear of each main turret
* 25 mm RHA around the small command tower at the secondary firing platform
* 30 mm RHA around the steering gear
* 14 mm anti-fragmentation armour on the torpedo tube mounts
* 8 mm RHA on the gunshields of the 100 mm B-34 cannons

As with the other Kirov-class cruisers, the Maxim Gorky is best described as an oversized light cruiser. She dwarves most of the other proper light cruisers and rivals the size of a heavy cruiser (just shorter than [[Mogami (Family)|Mogami-class]] heavy cruisers by 13 m). The Gorky's size is essentially a double-edged sword: it can be easily targeted at any ranges, yet it's very survivable despite only having a simple 70 mm of citadel armour, this is because most of the Gorky's critical components (such as main battery ammo racks and engines) were located inside the citadel sitting just below the waterline. This essentially turned the whole upper hull into a huge bullet sponge that can contain a lot of damage, save for a well-struck shot. Other than the citadel armour, Gorky's main turrets are also covered with 70 mm of armour to protect it from HE shells.

However, as mentioned above, Gorky lacks any substantial anti-fragmentation armour to protect her crew from incoming fire. This is essentially her Achilles' heels as she can be overwhelmed by several enemy ships firing HE shells at her. She is also vulnerable to bombs and torpedoes due to lack of hull armour as well.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
{{NavalMobility}}

It is faster than similar ships by a few km/h, but it still isn't a great advantage.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships is a catapult with one '''Beriev Be-2''' (aka '''KOR-1''') scout plane which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. Alongside the typical abilities of strafing with its two light machine guns, dropping 2 x 50 kg bombs, and capping zones, the KOR-1 and other scout planes have the added ability to lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilise the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new!

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The main cannons of the vehicle are good and should be used as its main weaponry in comparison with other ships that have good secondary armament. The best tactic would consist on staying behind cover to prevent being killed by torpedoes and paying attention to planes flying nearby because of the lack of good AA. The main armament has an excellent rate of fire, so it is possible to run out of ammo.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The main cannons have a short reload time
* Although it has the same ammo as the Krasny Kavkaz, the HE filler is high in comparison with other shells of similar calibre
* Better armour than the Kirov, which is the ship it was based on
* One scout seaplane

'''Cons:'''

* The anti-air is really inadequate consisting on 45 mm manually reloaded cannons with no time or proximity fuse, some DShKs and some 100 mm cannons that can use proximity fuse

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
