== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Sverdlov-class light cruiser, the last conventional gun cruisers built for the Soviet Navy. They were modified and enlarged versions of the [[Chapayev (Family)|Project 68-K Chapayev-class]] light cruisers. Unlike the Chapayev class, the Sverdlov class were built with two quintuple 533 mm torpedo launchers on each side of the hull, with two spare torpedoes for each launcher. The anti-aircraft armament was also strengthened as the Sverdlov class gained two additional pairs of 100 mm twin turrets as well as two 37 mm twin V-11 autocannon turrets. Despite their size and displacement, the maximum speed was an impressive 32.5 kn (60.2 km/h). Named after Mikhail Kutuzov, a Field Marshal of the Russian Empire that defeated Napoleon during his campaign to Russia, she was laid down on 23rd February 1951, commissioned on 30th December 1954, and assigned to the Black Sea Fleet of the Soviet Navy. In 1955, she became a test platform for the first naval helicopters, namely the Mi-1 and Ka-15. When on 29th October 1955, ex-Italian battleship Guilio Cesare, now Novorossiysk, exploded while at anchor at Sevastopol, Mikhail Kutuzov was the closest ship moored to the battleship. She immediately sent rescue teams to help and 27 of her sailors died during the rescue effort. In 1961, Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space visited the ship. In 1986, Mikhail Kutuzov became the last Sverdlov-class cruiser to undergo refit to Project 68-A standard which included removing all of her torpedo tubes and four twin 37 mm cannon mounts, and replacing them with 30 mm AK-230 CIWS mounts as well as changing her radar and ECM suite to the latest standard. She was transferred into reserve in 1987 and decommissioned on 3rd June 1992. Stricken from inventory in 2000 and on 28th July 2002 she became a museum ship permanently moored in Novorossiysk.

Mikhail Kutuzov was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]]. Her armour protection is a significant improvement over the previous Project 26 class, which the Project 68 and 68-K and 68-A design comes from, as well as having guns with higher rate of fire, although at cost of penetration characteristic. Her anti-aircraft protection suite was expanded with thirty-two 37 mm automatic V-11 cannon barrels as well as twelve 100 mm dual purpose guns and eight twin 30 mm AK-230 CIWS mounts as she is depicted after her Project 68-A refit from 1986. The anti-air capability is further enhanced by a search and track radar with range of up to 150 km. Just like Chapayev, her magazines are close to waterline being more vulnerable to being hit, leading to fatal explosion.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The armour of the Mikhail Kutuzov is effectively identical to that of the Sverdlov, with the most noticeable changes being those on the superstructure and conning tower. The belt armour is 100 mm of RHA, whilst the deck armour is 50 mm RHA.

The general survivability is worse than the Sverdlov, mostly due to a significantly smaller crew, but also more vulnerable AA ammunition locations, creating a higher chance of an ammunition detonation.

{{main|152 mm/57 B-38 (152 mm)}}
The Mikhail Kutuzov is armed with twelve 152 mm/57 B-38 cannons in four turrets in triple mounts. These guns boast formidable fire rate of 7.5 rounds per minute while also possessing great penetration capabilities on AP shell and well above average levels of explosive filler in all shell types. All information about ammunition used in the cannons can be found in the tables below.

{{main|V-11 (37 mm)|AK-230 (30 mm)}}

The AA weaponry of the Kutuzov is similar to the 50s era Sverdlov, being mainly composed of V-11 37 mm gun mounts, however the Kutuzov is also equipped with an array of advanced AK-230 CIWS (Close In Weapons System) mounts, which is the main feature of the ship that sets it aside from the Sverdlov.

Being CIWS mounts, they were designed with shooting down missiles, which tend to be much smaller and faster than aircraft, so you'd think they'd be great against aircraft. Whilst they do provide a highly lethal field of bullets that can rip apart inbound aircraft, these mounts are not quite as accurate as you'd expect them to be in real life. They may be modern mounts, but they do not have a more advanced targeting system modelled in and are still controlled by the same hit and miss AI as on any other ship. They also don't have a very big pool of ammunition, being designed for short bursts against straight-flying missiles. A short burst might be fine for a missile, but manoeuvring aircraft are a different matter entirely, especially when the guns are controlled by the in-game AI, which will hold down fire until the attacker is destroyed or it is out of bullets. There's also the issue that they don't have a massive range, which means that an aircraft close enough to be targeted is probably not far off from being able to drop its ordnance, if it hasn't already.

All being said, they are still potentially very deadly threats to aircraft in range, being able to track aircraft much faster than most other gun mounts and having a biblical rate of fire that deletes any unarmoured target it touches.

As a side note, despite being specifically designed to take out missiles, the mounts currently do not have this functionality modelled in game. If the ship is under attack by missile armed vehicles, such as a Tornado or USS Douglas, the CIWS mounts will utterly ignore the missiles and make no effort to intercept them.

== Usage in battles ==

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Uses an effective three-tiered anti-aircraft suite
* Has access to radar, granting more situational awareness against air attacks
* Powerful secondaries

'''Cons:'''

* No scout aircraft onboard
* No torpedoes, making larger warships a greater threat
* Worse survivability than the Sverdlov
* Belt armour is inadequate compared to other cruisers
