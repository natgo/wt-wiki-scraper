== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]]. In its 1986 refit, the Sverdlov-class cruiser Mikhail Kutuzov is one of the most modern naval vessels in the game and by far the most modern of the cruisers, though the refit of the ship did not include any missiles as the date might suggest, leaving general gameplay very similar to the more WW2 era cruisers found in game.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|152 mm/57 B-38 (152 mm)}}
The Mikhail Kutuzov is armed with twelve 152 mm/57 B-38 cannons in four turrets in triple mounts. These guns boast formidable fire rate of 7.5 rounds per minute while also possessing great penetration capabilities on AP shell and well above average levels of explosive filler in all shell types. All information about ammunition used in the cannons can be found in the tables below.

{{main|V-11 (37 mm)|AK-230 (30 mm)}}

The AA weaponry of the Kutuzov is similar to the 50s era Sverdlov, being mainly composed of V-11 37 mm gun mounts, however the Kutuzov is also equipped with an array of advanced AK-230 CIWS (Close In Weapons System) mounts, which is the main feature of the ship that sets it aside from the Sverdlov. 

Being CIWS mounts, they were designed with shooting down missiles, which tend to be much smaller and faster than aircraft, so you'd think they'd be great against aircraft. Whilst they do provide a highly lethal field of bullets that can rip apart inbound aircraft, these mounts are not quite as accurate as you'd expect them to be in real life. They may be modern mounts, but they do not have a more advanced targeting system modelled in and are still controlled by the same hit and miss AI as on any other ship. They also don't have a very big pool of ammunition, being designed for short bursts against straight-flying missiles. A short burst might be fine for a missile, but manoeuvring aircraft are a different matter entirely, especially when the guns are controlled by the in-game AI, which will hold down fire until the attacker is destroyed or it is out of bullets. There's also the issue that they don't have a massive range, which means that an aircraft close enough to be targeted is probably not far off from being able to drop its ordinance, if it hasn't already. 

All being said, they are still potentially very deadly threats to aircraft in range, being able to track aircraft much faster than most other gun mounts and having a biblical rate of fire that deletes any unarmoured target it touches. 

As a side note, despite being specifically designed to take out missiles, the mounts currently do not have this functionality modelled in game. If the ship is under attack by missile armed vehicles, such as a Tornado or USS Douglas, the CIWS mounts will utterly ignore the missiles and make no effort to intercept them. 

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Uses an effective three-tiered anti-aircraft suite
* Has access to radar, granting more situational awareness against air attacks

'''Cons:'''

* No scout aircraft onboard
