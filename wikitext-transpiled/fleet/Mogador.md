The '''Mogador''' was the peak of the French contre-torpilleur destroyer design before the Second World War, featuring an exceptional combination of speed and armament. Launched in June 1937, she reached a record top speed of 43.45 knots during sea trials. In October 1939, Mogador took part in Atlantic operations as part of the ''Force de Raid'', safeguarding against German convoy raiders. On 3 July 1940, while stationed at Mers-el-Kébir, she became a victim during Operation Catapult. After the French refused the ultimatum, the British opened fire and hit Mogador with a 15-inch shell, obliterating her stern. Vichy France undertook extensive repairs and a significant refit, but progress was slowed down by material shortages. Ultimately, to prevent her capture by German forces, Mogador was scuttled at Toulon on 27 November 1942. After eventual refloating, she was scrapped in 1949.

Introduced in [[Update "Dance of Dragons"]], '''{{Specs|name}}''' features excellent mobility, main armament and torpedoes, but has very poor anti-air and anti-boat defences for her BR, making her a relatively easy and attractive target for a number of typically unexpected enemies.

The Mogador was the lead ship of the French Mogador-class contre-torpilleurs, representing the pinnacle of the French "super-destroyer" concept of the late 1930s. Built under the 1932 and 1934 naval programmes, she was designed to outgun and outrun any potential adversary, boasting an unprecedented combination of speed and firepower unmatched by foreign contemporaries. Laid down on 28 October 1935 and launched on 9 June 1937, Mogador was commissioned into the Marine Nationale in 1939. On trials, she achieved a remarkable speed of nearly 44 knots, making her one of the fastest destroyers of her time.

Early in the Second World War, Mogador served with the French ''Force de Raid'', a fast squadron tasked with hunting German commerce raiders and protecting vital Atlantic convoys. Between 21 and 30 October 1939, she participated in operations covering convoy KJ.4 against a possible attack by the German pocket battleship Deutschland. During this mission, the force successfully captured the German blockade-runner Santa Fé on 25 October, showcasing the effectiveness of the French naval forces during this period.

On 3 July 1940, Mogador was stationed at Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria when the British Royal Navy launched Operation Catapult, aiming to neutralise the French fleet to prevent it from falling into German hands. During the surprise attack by Force H, Mogador attempted to sortie but was struck by a 15-inch shell from [[HMS Hood]]. The shell hit her stern, detonating her depth charges and blowing off the aft section of the ship. Despite losing her stern and suffering 42 casualties, the crew managed to prevent her from sinking by running her aground.

Following the attack, Mogador was towed to Toulon for repairs. During the 1940 refit, her destroyed fourth turret was removed, and the third turret was relocated to its position. The vacant space left by the third turret was utilised to enhance her anti-aircraft capabilities with the installation of two twin 37 mm anti-aircraft guns. These modifications reflected the increasing importance of anti-aircraft defence during the war. However, Mogador's service was cut short when she was scuttled at Toulon on 27 November 1942, along with much of the French fleet, to prevent her capture by German forces. She was later refloated by Italians on 5 April 1943, damaged by an Allied bomb on 29 April, then again on 4 May 1944. She was ordered to be beached at Brégaillon and remained there until 1949, when she was refloated for breaking up.
