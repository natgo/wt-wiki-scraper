The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

=== Mobility ===

''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Nürnberg is really just an enhanced Leipzig, and you should play it the same way. Your guns now fire much faster, so feel free to rain down shells on distant opponents, as well as clobber any cruisers that get too close. Your torpedo protection is still there and your armour has improved, so you should be able to take a good chunk of damage from smaller battery fire. You also have a larger crew, and you're even faster. The biggest improvement, aside from the main guns, is the AA battery, which is colossal on the Nürnberg. Enemy aircraft will get mowed down if they get too close, so don't be scared to stick to bigger ships and protect them while they take out the enemy ships you're more scared of.

The Nürnberg's gun placement is still as bad as the Leipzig's, and your higher BR means getting hit on your broadside can be painful. Only bring the rear guns around when you know counter-battery fire will be minimal, or is too far away to be effective.

=== Pros and cons ===
''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".''

'''Pros:'''

* Great reload on main battery allows for dangerous, repeated broadsides
* Phenomenal close-range AA battery that will decimate planes which get too close
* Great armour protection and crew number makes this a hard ship to sink

'''Cons:'''

* A big target, especially on broadside, makes this an enticing target for heavy cruisers
* Awkward turret layout forces you to show broadside to use majority of main guns
* AA battery is far less effective against long-range targets

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

Nürnberg was a German light cruiser of the Leipzig-class, built as a follow-up to the Könisberg-class. The ship carried a main armament of nine 15 cm SK C/25 guns, as well as two torpedo tubes and a variety of anti-aircraft defences. Launched in 1934, the ship served in the Baltic and participated in numerous exercises before the outbreak of war. She saw active service in 1939 and 1940, but was relegated to training duties for the majority of the Second World War. Following the German defeat, she was ceded to the Soviets, who operated her as Admiral Makarov until 1954.

=== Design and construction ===
[[File:Nurnberg Silhouette.jpg|thumb|400x400px|An identification chart for the Nürnberg,]]
The Nürnberg, being a further development of the Könisberg-class of light cruisers, inherited many characteristics of its predecessor. The ship was 181 m long and displaced 9,040 tons standard.<ref name=":0">Chen, C. (2006)</ref> Powered by twin steam turbines, she could reach a maximum speed of 32.5 knots (60 km/h), and had an endurance of 7,200 km. Main armament consisted of nine [[15 cm/60 SK C/25 (150 mm)|15 cm SK C/25]] naval guns in three triple turrets; one was located forward of the superstructure while the others were located in a superfiring arrangement in the rear.<ref name=":0" /> The ship also initially carried four triple torpedo launchers, though two were removed in 1942. The ship was initially designed with a light anti-aircraft armament, but this was improved in later refits.<ref name=":0" />

The Nürnberg was laid down in late 1933 at Kiel,<ref name=":0" /> and was launched in December of that year. Construction was completed very quickly, and the ship was formally commissioned into the German Kriegsmarine on November 2nd, 1935.<ref name=":0" />

=== Operational History ===
Soon after she was commissioned, the Nürnberg was sent to the Baltic, where she remained until April 1936. Thereafter, she joined [[Köln]] and [[Leipzig]] for a training cruise in the Atlantic. Between 1937 and 1939, she participated in several non-intervention cruises in the Atlantic,<ref name=":1">Emmerich, M. (2011)</ref> as well as a cruise in the Mediterranean and the Fleet Review for Adolf Hitler and Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy. Prior to the start of the Second World War, she returned to the Baltic for another training deployment.<ref name=":1" />

After the outbreak of war, Nürnberg participated in the blockade and hunt for the Polish navy. Despite their efforts, several Polish destroyers escaped and arrived in the UK. Between late 1939 and late 1940, the Nürnberg laid mines to protect coastal fortifications, and escorted several larger vessels on their respective duties. She was torpedoed with minor damage by HMS Salmon in 1940, but was otherwise unscathed by Allied forces.<ref name=":0" />

In late 1940, Nürnberg was relegated to training duties. As a result, she spent the majority of the remainder of the war in Norway along with the battleship Tirpitz. A rapidly-changing crew resulted in a low state of readiness; as a result, the ship saw no action during this period. At the start of 1945, Nürnberg was tasked with mine-laying duties; however, a shortage of fuel resulted in only a single sortie.<ref name=":1" /> On May 5th 1945, she received the ceasefire order, and was thereafter handed over to the Allies.

Following the Potsdam conference, it was decided that Nürnberg would be handed over to Russia as a war prize. The ship was renamed Admiral Makarov,<ref name=":0" /> and was assigned to the 8th fleet. She became the flagship of the 8th Fleet in 1948,<ref name=":1" /> but was later withdrawn due to the commissioning of the new [[Chapayev]]-class cruisers. She was subsequently returned to her original duties as a training vessel. Nürnberg was decommissioned in early 1959;<ref name=":0" /> it is believed that she was scrapped shortly thereafter. She was the longest-serving major warship of the Kriegsmarine, and the only one to see active service after the war.
