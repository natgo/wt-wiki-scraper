== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a British-built G-class destroyer loaned to the Polish Navy in 1940, under the previous designation of HMS Garland. She operated as part of convoy escorts for almost the entirety of the Second World War and visited most of the war theatres.

She was introduced during [[Update "New Power"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season I]]. Ex-HMS Garland performs very similar to the playstyle of the sister ship already in the regular tree, the destroyer [[G-class (H89)|HMS Grafton (H89)]]. While, at the same time, having some pros and cons on her own. Such as the increased variety of secondary armaments that reinforce the support role of this class. Unfortunately, some drawbacks in mobility are present, as well as reductions in the main armament to increase the auxiliary armament.

== General info ==
The Garland (H37) appears more aggressive than the escort destroyers [[Town (L45)]] and the [[Hunt (Family)]], this is thanks to her long and taller hull with a raked type of bow that provides increased sea-worthiness and enhanced cruising speed - at least before armaments refits. The destroyer can be differentiated from the similar [[G-class (H89)]] because of the Polish naval ensign with a horizontal bicoloured red and white, located in the stern of the ship. Another way to differentiate between the two is the Garland's light grey hull painting and the olive-green coloured upper decks. The Grafton's hull will be painted black with maroon red upper decks, though these colour schemes might vary in arctic scenarios. Garland's second funnel top is lower, a stern-located 120 mm cannon and one set of quadruple torpedo tubes is also missing.

Knowing this armament layout and visual differences should help to recognise these destroyers, since the ORP Garland lacks the destroyer vs. destroyer armaments of the HMS Grafton, and HMS Grafton lacks the support armament of the ORP Garland.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Large medium to short range anti-air firepower
* Dual-purpose main calibre guns, also with readiness of SAP rounds
* 8 x long-range torpedoes

'''Cons:'''

* Limited firepower with only 3 main calibre guns
* Inadequate crew size: out-classed when duelling late rank I and rank II destroyers
* Top speed is more similar to escort destroyers than combat-capable Fleet destroyers.
