The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the lead ship of the Ognevoy-class destroyers built for the Soviet Navy in the 1940s. She was laid down on 20th August 1939 and commissioned on 22nd March 1945. The construction of all Ognevoy-class destroyers was halted due to the German attack on the Soviet Union. Ognevoy was towed from Nikolayev to Sevastopol between August 13th and 17th 1941. With the advancing German army, Ognevoy received a pair of 76 mm guns in single turret as per the design, and then evacuated factory workers and their families. She was towed to Poti and later on to Batumi where in 1943 she was slowly outfitted. Her main armament turrets were salvaged from the sunk destroyer-leader [[Tashkent]]. On 20th April 1944, her outfitting was finished and trials began. She saw no action during WWII. In 1947 she escorted Kirov-class light cruiser Molotov with J.V. Stalin onboard from Yalta to Sochi. On 17th February 1956, she was withdrawn from service and on 13th October 1958 sold for scrap.

Ognevoy was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]]. The Ognevoy with her top speed of 68 km/h is on par or slower than contemporary destroyers. She is armed with six 37 mm autocannons providing great short to medium range anti-air and surface to surface protection. Her torpedo armament is made of two triple 533 mm torpedo launchers amidship with quite short ranged yet fast and powerful torpedoes. The 53-39 torpedoes have maximal range of 4 km at 94 km/h while carrying 317 kg of TNT eq warhead. The ship itself has no armour protection except her turrets being protected by 8 mm thick antifragmentation armour. The machinery takes more than half of the entire hull length making nearly any hit into the hull fatal for boilers or transmission, crippling the Ognevoy's ability to manoeuvre. Her magazines are also located on the waterline making them susceptible to fatal explosion when hit.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The hull of the ship is made of 11 mm of steel plates, while the turrets are protected by thinner 8 mm steel. The superstructure is protected by 11 mm steel. Due to the Pr. 30 Ognevoy being a destroyer, this ship is lacking in armour in favour for more speed.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Although the Pr. 30 may be a bit slower than Frunze (38 kts vs 48 kts), you will notice better rudder performance.

{{main|B-13 (130 mm)}}

The {{PAGENAME}} introduces the famous Soviet 130 mm B-13 mount naval guns, found on all other Soviet destroyers up until the Spokoinyy. These 130 mm guns are a significant upgrade from the 102 mm cannons that the starter Frunze is equipped with, featuring a greater calibre and larger shells. Heavier shells also means that the ballistic performance of the 130 mm guns are superior to the 102 mm guns, and are easier to aim over longer distances. This is a consistent advantage that the Soviet 130 mm guns have over other smaller calibres such as 127 mm and 120 mm. Moreover, the calibre of these guns allows for much greater destructive capability, and these guns retain a solid fire rate of 12 rounds per minute.

While having four guns in two twin mounts is a space-efficient way of getting good firepower, this also results in a distinct vulnerability. Disabling one turret results in a loss of 50% of total firepower, and therefore the firepower of the Ognevoy is in practice inconsistent. The B-13 mounts have very little armour, and do not have exceptional rotation speed.

Three types of shells are available: HE, SAP, and HE-VT. The HE has a satisfactory filler of 3.58 kg of TNT, and compares favourably to other destroyer-calibre guns. HE is good at disabling other destroyer's guns and exposed weaponry, as well as hull-breaking smaller coastal vessels, but does not have enough power to effectively damage internals components. Moreover, HE deals quite poorly with cruisers, so SAP is recommended in most cases. The SAP shell has a good penetration of 183 mm at 1,000 m and a very good explosive mass of 2.35 g of TNT. SAP is adept at destroying internal components such as engines and even ammo racks, and is the quickest way to reduce crew count of an enemy vessel. Moreover, the good penetration of the 130 mm SAP allows the Ognevoy to combat light cruisers if the Ognevoy is placed in an up-tier.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|39-K (76 mm)}}

There is only one twin 76 mm 39-K turret, located behind the second rangefinder. Performance is mediocre against surface targets due to low number of guns. However, the mount has good elevation and can supplement the 37 mm autocannons in anti-aircraft fire. Therefore, the HE-TF shell is recommended over other shell types.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

The anti-aircraft armament are the largest improvement over the Frunze. These 37 mm/67 70-K automatic guns can engage air and smaller coastal vessels with a fair amount of effectiveness. While the 37 mm 70-K guns may not compare quite as favourably to the formidable 40 mm Bofors cannon, the 70-K is still a very good weapon against light and fast targets.

The Ognevoy also has two DShK 12.7 mm machine guns, but these guns have heavily limited fire angles and are therefore quite difficult to use.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-39 (533 mm)|BB-1 depth charge}}

The Ognevoy has access to six 533 mm 53-39 torpedoes in two triple mounts, and these torpedoes will sink any ship or boat at the BR range that is hit. The speed and explosive mass of these torpedoes are average.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ognevoy is a good all-round destroyer. Good guns, good anti-aircraft weapons, and decent torpedoes. Although it may be a bit slow, this weakness is well compensated by the numerous strengths. If the player is in a squad, it is a good escort ship.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent AA defense thanks to 37 mm cannons
* Can easily destroy PT boats with 37 mm cannons
* Fairly good speed and rudder handling
* Relatively powerful main battery for tier

'''Cons:'''

* Main battery is disabled semi frequently, costing you a significant portion of your firepower
* Stock torpedoes have a range of just 4 km
* First stage ammo storage is easily depleted in sustained combat
* Fires tend to lead to rapid detonations while in near stock configuration

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Interestingly enough, there is not that much known about this ship. This class of ships was intended to be an improvement over the Project 7 and Project 7U destroyers. Ognevoy got its guns straight from the Tashkent Destroyer when the ship was salvaged. Only two ships were constructed before and during WW2, while the rest was were completed following the war. The Pr. 30 Ognevoy made the way for the Skoryy-class of destroyers. The combat record of Ognevoy itself is unknown, but some sources indicate that it served to its full potential.
