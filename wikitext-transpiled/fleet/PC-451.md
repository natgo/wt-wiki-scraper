== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American sub-chaser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The PC-451 is the first ship in the USA line to gain all-round steel armour protection, with between 5-8 mm of protection on all areas. This allows the ship to be mostly immune to .50 cal fire and under, while also giving good protection against 20 mm fire when angled well. However, when not angled those shells will have no problem penetrating through.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Without any upgrades purchased, the PC-451 has a top speed of 35 km/h in RB (45 km/h in AB). While being a lighter and more nimble vessel than other larger ships like destroyers, players must still be aware that the PC-451 will need some time to make a full stop in the water, as it is a heavy ship for its class, weighing in at about 374 tons. The ship has very good mobility considering its overall characteristics. It is advised that players plan out their movements thoroughly with the PC-451 to get the most out of its mobility, as it is a heavier ship.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|3-inch Mark 10 (76 mm)}}

The PC-451's primary armament is a 3-inch cannon, which gives it considerable stopping power. Well-placed shots can disable smaller craft with ease and do major damage to larger ships. Use the HE shells when facing lower ranked enemies, and the AP shells when up-tiered. The HE-VT shells can be effective against aircraft while being used as mini HE shells, but using them in that fashion is not ideal.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mark V (20 mm)}}

The PC-41 is armed with a large amount of 20 mm Oerlikon cannons, some in twin mounts and some in single mounts. These double as both AA weapons and a secondary armament and are capable of punching through most armour. Use the default belts, due to their equal mix of AP and HE shells. The AP shells give them a good amount of penetrating power, enough to pierce most armour at your battle rating, while keeping enough HE to deal with lighter targets.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.6 depth charge|7.2 in T37}}

The PC-451 is armed with both depth charges and charge mortars. With enough daring, one can use them to give a huge punch to other vessels, but they will more likely be hit by fire and damage your ship. It is not recommended to take them unless you believe you can use them effectively.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This ship is an excellent vehicle even in an uptier compared to other US boats due to the steel hull, 20 mm secondary armaments, and a 76 mm cannon able to knock out a PT boat. Though the steel hull is good enough against even a small crowd of PT boats, larger ships with bigger guns could still destroy the PC-451 with ease.

During a match, the {{PAGENAME}} is best used somewhat during the middle or towards the end of a match as the second or third spawn, and not rush into hot zones. It is best to angle into the zone where more of your guns can engage than straight in.

The number of players attempting to torpedo will go down, while planes will start spawning in. Using the secondary weapons, the PC-451 can bring down multiple enemies and rack up points. However, dedicated and skilled pilots can still get a drop on the PC-451 if left unattended with all the PC-451's firepower.

In terms of shell selection for the main armament, which consists of HE, HE-VT (variable time-fused), and APHE, bring Fuse and HE during downtiers as the HE can cripple boats easily while the Fuse can be used to target aircraft, adding the main armament into the defensive network the 20 mm secondaries provide already. In uptiers, HE and AP are recommended for dealing with more persistent boats. While destroyers could be damaged with the HE, anything further than 3 km away should be engaged with the AP shell in order to penetrate through armour.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The 3-inch gun is powerful for its rank
* Powerful AA defence
* First US ship to receive all-out steel hull with some armour
* The main 3-inch gun has access to HE-VT rounds, useful for targeting aircraft at range
* 46 crew members, more durable

'''Cons:'''

* Not very fast
* Not very manoeuvrable
* Big target
* 3-inch gun can be difficult to master for newer players

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

PC-451 was an experimental submarine-chaser class. It was laid down on September 28, 1939 as Hull No.166, by DeFoe Boat and Motor Works, Bay City, Michigan. It was built as a part of the Experimental Small Craft program of 17 May 1938. The ships were called X-boats, and were classified as 165 footers, but the ships had differing characteristics. It was launched on May 23, 1940, and was commissioned on August 12, 1940 as the USS '''PC-451'''. It was assigned to the East Coast of the United States. The ship sank the American tug Nancy Moran  off the eastern coast of Florida on December 26, 1941 by ramming, likely by accident. The USS PC-451 was decommissioned on December 2, 1945, and was struck from the Naval Register on January 8, 1946. It was transferred to the Maritime Commission in January 1947, to be disposed of. It is unknown what happened to the ship after that point.

The ship had a displacement of 374 t, a length of 163 ft, and a beam of 20 ft 9 in. It was powered by two 2,880 bhp General Motors 16-258S diesel engines, two General Motors 6-233A diesel engines, and Farrel-Birmingham 75 kw generator sets. It had a single reduction gear and two shafts. The armament consisted of two 3"/50 dual-purpose mounts, two twin 20 mm mounts, two single 20 mm mounts, two Mk 20 Mousetrap projectors, two k-gun depth charge projectors and two depth charge racks. The crew complement was 65 sailors and officers, and the maximum speed was 18.8 knots.
