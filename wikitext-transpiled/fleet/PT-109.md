== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was one of the earliest pre-orders offered to access the fleet closed beta test before being removed from the store with the wide-release of the closed beta test in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The hull structure of the boat has no armour at all. The only armour present on this boat is the bridge that contains 6 mm of antifragmentation armour, and the 13 mm rolled homogeneous armour of the 20 mm mount.

Most of the front hull is open space, and so there are no critical components that could be hit if rounds come in across at the front end. However, from the bridge on backwards is the engine, ammo, torpedoes, and fuel all scattered around that could be easily hit, ignited, or detonated.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

Two turrets with twin-mounted AN-M2 machine guns are had around the bridge area. Despite their full-flexible 360 degree traverse, limitations with the boat structure will severely restrict their fire angles against enemy boats.

{{main|21 in Mk.8 (533 mm)}}

The PT-109 is armed with four 21 in wet-heating Mk.8 torpedoes, which are mounted with two on the port side and two on the starboard side. Both are angled from the front and so requires angling to get onto target.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Slender PT boat profile
* Quite speedy at flank speed
* Open space in front could let some lucky shots pass through harmlessly

'''Cons:'''

* Limits in gun traverse means, despite able to traverse 360 degree, there are many angles where only one turret could aim onto target
* Both primary armaments are only able to be used on ship targets at ship starboard side
* Torpedoes at each side are split at an angle, requires manoeuvring to get a decent aim at a target in front

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

'''Construction'''

PT-109 was laid down by Elco (Electric Launch Company) in Bayonne, New Jersey, on 4 March 1942. It was launched on 20 June 1942, delivered to the U.S. Navy on 10 July, and completed on 19 July.

'''Initial Service'''

Under the command of CDR Henry Farrow, USN, '''PT-109''' was first attached to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron FIVE (MTBRon5). MTBRon 5 was assigned to the Panama Sea Frontier beginning in September 1942. On 22 September 1942, PT-109 was transferred to MTBRon 2, with her new commanding officer LT George A. Brackett, USNR. MTBRon 2 was transferred to the South Pacific in 1942. There, the squadron took part in the Solomons campaign, fighting night actions against the Japanese Tokyo Express with the goal of defending the US-held Guadalcanal. MTBRon 2 was at Tulagi island on 23 April 1943, when LTJG John F. Kennedy took command of the PT-109.
