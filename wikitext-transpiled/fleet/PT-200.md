== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
As with any coastal motor torpedo boat, the PT-200's survivability is not its strength. The entire ship is made out of wood and also lacks any armour plating aside from 9.52 mm of hardened armour on the rear single Bofors 40 mm turret. The crew count of just twelve crewmembers is relatively average among Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs), meaning that the PT-200 will not be able to take many hits as well. Keep in mind that the ship can be hull-broken by most shells of 88 mm and above; luckily, it doesn't face many ships with such high-calibre weapons. In terms of vital components, the ship's engines and ammunition magazines all lie partway above the water; this means that a lucky hit from a lower-calibre shell could potentially detonate your ammunition, resulting in a floating inferno. In general, avoid any firefights with the PT-200 as it will be decimated quickly due to its low survivability.

Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)|AN-M4 (37 mm)}}

The 37 mm cannon is similar to the one mounted on the [[P-39 (Family)|P-39s]]. As such, it has poor accuracy but high damage. With its ability to fire for a decent time prior to over-heating, it serves as a potent close range weapons, at the cost of DPS.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

The 20 mm cannons serve as a potent light AA weapon and a potent anti ship weapon. They are unable to hit targets at range, however, and excel in close range brawls.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

Despite lacking at high BRs, as this ship will likely only face light boats and planes, the .50 cals that saturate its deck make it a potent anti-air boat. Unfortunately, like the cannons they have a short range and have poor angles of firing and depression, limiting their surface usage.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.7|Mk.13 (569 mm)}}

The 4 torpedoes make a potent anti-ship weapon, but due to the slowness of steam-powered torpedoes, they do not have a long range or fast speed, especially compared to the Japanese oxygen torpedo.

The Mk.7 rockets are very situational and typically serve only to create an extra ammo rack.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
As with all PT boats, this vessel is purely a high speed cap zone taker, and close range brawler. Like a glass cannon, this boat can do serious damage with its main guns, but also can be very easily destroyed. In low tier matches, this boat serves as a potent vehicle to contest cap zones, and in higher matches, whilst destroyer hunting is not advisable due to destroyers' ability to fire at you with their secondaries using just AI, you can still win some vital, early game cap contests, as those early caps often determine the entire outcome of the game.

Another possible strategy for the usage of this boat is plane hunting, as in low tier battles AI anti-aircraft defences are a rarity, and the primary 40 mm cannon is devastating to aircraft if it hits. Torpedo use is also highly effective with this boat, as using a double spread of torpedoes can trap many an unsuspecting opponent. Be aware of gunboats and destroyers, their overwhelming primary and secondary armaments can easily sink your vessel, sometimes even through hull-break.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Two rocket racks (8 rockets each) can be attached
* Decent firepower
* Can demolish most competitors at its BR

'''Cons:'''

* No armour and very small crew count
* Can hull break
* Expensive to repair
* Often fights well-armoured ferries
* Very weak when even slightly up-tiered

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

PT-200 was a Higgins 78-foot Motor Torpedo Boat of the United States Navy. It was laid down by Higgins Industries in New Orleans, LA, on 29 June 1942. She was launched on 16 September 1942 and completed and commissioned on 23 January 1943.

PT-200 had a length of 78 ft, a beam of 20 ft 8 in, and a draft of 5 ft 3 in. The displacement was 56 tons and it was manned by a crew of 17. The ship was powered by three 1,500 shp Packard W-14 M2500 gasoline engines, turning three shafts; a speed of 41 knots could be achieved. The armament consisted of one 20 mm gun, two twin .50 cal mounts (total of four machine guns), and four 21 inch torpedoes.

PT-200 was first assigned to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Four (MBTRon 4, under the command of LCDR William C. Specht, USN. MBTRon 4 was a training squadron based at the MTB Squadrons Training Center in Melville, RI. It was the largest MTB squadron, with a peak of 28 boats in the squadron at a time. PT-200 was sunk after hitting an unknown object on 22 February 1944; the location was off of Newport, RI, at 41º23'N, 71º01'W.
