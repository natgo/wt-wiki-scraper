== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} has the following structural layout:

* Hull: 40 mm, wood
* Superstructure: 15 mm, wood

It has a crew of only 12 but is capable of surviving losing up to 9 members before being destroyed. All of its components packed together with little room to spare so penetrating shots will likely hit modules as well as damaging the hull. With no additional armour besides the wood it is composed of, this is not a ship that can take very much damage.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility
|SpeedForwardStockAB = 76
|SpeedBackStockAB = 17
|SpeedForwardStockRB = 63
|SpeedBackStockRB = 14
}}

The {{PAGENAME}} is a very mobile ship and boasts an excellent speed of 74 km/h, able to keep up with all but the fastest of Russian MTBs. The {{PAGENAME}} has a displacement of 49 tons.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

The four 12.7 mm AN-M2 machine guns have a great rate of fire, allowing it to deal plenty of damage quickly. It is best used at ranges under 1 km, any further and the bullets do significantly less damage and require more compensation for the ballistics. Since the guns rely on sheer rate of fire to destroy enemies, it is capable of engaging both naval and air targets. The recommended belt is APIT. It has slightly less penetrating than AP, but gains the ability to set fires.

Three ammo belts are available:

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

The 20 mm Oerlikon on the rear of the boat covers the rear blind spot of your quad machine guns. Since the 20 mm has far less damage output compared to the four machine guns, the 20 mm cannon should only be used when the enemy is in that rear blind spot.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|21 in Mk.8 (533 mm)}}

Torpedoes are not particularly useful at the PT-71's BR. They should only be used to against slow moving gunboats or spammed towards commonly travelled choke points.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The PT-71 can be considered a direct upgrade to the reserve tier [[PT-6]] and should be played similarly. The quad machine guns benefit from a great vantage point, and can both be fired directly forward, making relatively quick work of most opponents you will face. The 20 mm Oerlikon Mk.II also packs a good punch, and, considering its positioning, has a decent field of coverage as well.

The optimal angle to engage other boats is to sail directly at them. You reveal only your bow and bridge to enemy fire, while all four of your machine guns can pepper them with bullets. When going up against bigger ships, use your speed, evasive manoeuvres, and natural cover to approach and drop torpedoes as closely as possible. Then turn tail and run, using your 20 mm and smoke to shake off any pursuers. Alternatively, some players choose to forgo torpedoes altogether, favouring a lower chance of ammo detonation over the ability to engage bigger ships. All in all, the PT-71 is a versatile boat that is not lacking in any department except for armour (but this is the standard at the rank), and it is a good boat for those just getting into Naval Battles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good rate of fire, ensuring a steady stream of firepower and maximizing damage potential.
* Unobstructed gun placement, offering clear firing arcs (with the exception of potential interference between guns).
* Equipped with four torpedoes, providing substantial offensive capabilities against enemy vessels.
* Good speed

'''Cons:'''

* Weak armour, necessitating a reliance on agility and strategic positioning for survival (though this is standard for the rank)
* Compact size of the boat results in closely packed components, making it susceptible to significant damage from a single well-placed hit.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The '''PT-71''' was laid down on December 2, 1941 by Higgins Industries, in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was launched on May 4, 1942, and was completed on July 20, 1942. It was commissioned on April 27, 1943 as the USS PT-71, and it was assigned to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron FOUR (MTBRon 4) under the command of Lt. Comdr. William C. Specht, USN. MTBRon 4 was the training squadron for motor torpedo boat crews, based at MTB Squadrons Training Center, at Melville, Rhode Island.

The PT-71 was transferred to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron SIXTEEN (MTBRon 16) under the command of Lt. Comdr. Russell H. Smith, USN, on January 20, 1943. MTBRon saw action during the Aleutian Campaign.

On March 13, 1943 the PT-71 was transferred to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron SEVENTEEN (MTBRon 17) under the command of Lt. Comdr. Russell B. Allen, USN. MTBRon 17 was assigned to the Hawaiian Sea Frontier. On April 16, 1943 the PT-71 was transferred back to MTBRon 4.

On March 18, 1944 the ship was transferred to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron TWO - (MTBRon 2) under the command of Comdr. John D. Bulkeley, USN. MTBRon 2 was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services, and was located in the English Channel. Between May and October of 1944 the squadron carried out 20 missions, landing supplies and personnel in enemy occupied territory. On October 11, 1945 the PT-71 was struck from the Naval Register. It was stripped and destroyed on October 21, 1945 at Samar, in the Philippines.

The PT-71 had a displacement of 56 t, a length of 71 ft, a beam of 20 ft 8 in, and a draft of 5 ft 3 in. It was powered by three 1,500 shp Packard W-14 M2500 gasoline engines, and had three shafts. The armament consisted of four 21" torpedoes, one 40 mm mount, and two twin .50 cal. machine guns. The crew complement was 17 sailors and officers, and it had a maximum speed of 40 knots.
