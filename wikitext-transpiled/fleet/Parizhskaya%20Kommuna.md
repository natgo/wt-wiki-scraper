The Parizhskaya Kommuna was the lead ship of the Sevastopol-class (also known as Gangut-class) battleships of the Imperial Russian Navy. The ship was commissioned in 1911 under the name Sevastopol, but would later be renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna by the new Soviet government. Over the 1920s, Parizhskaya Kommuna underwent a major modernisation, including a new flared bow, upgraded armament, armour, and machinery. In 1929, the ship was transferred to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, where she served as the fleet flagship through the 1930s. During World War II, Parizhskaya Kommuna provided artillery support to Soviet forces defending Sevastopol and survived several German air raids, though she was eventually evacuated to Poti on the Black Sea coast. Over the next year, Parizhskaya Kommuna participated in bombardment missions against German forces in Crimea, including the Kerch-Feodosia Amphibious Operation. In 1943, the ship was renamed back to Sevastopol and served in a support role for the rest of the war.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (or "Paris Commune") is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet battleship {{Battle-rating}}, introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]]. s a World War II refit, the Parizhskaya Kommuna features enhanced survivability compared to her World War I-era predecessor, the Poltava, particularly with regards to vertical protection. A vastly increased anti-aircraft armament acts as an excellent deterrent to aerial threats, while increased turret roof as well as deck armour improves survivability even if the Parizhskaya Kommuna is hit from above. Moreover, the main armament of 12 x 305 mm guns has an increased rate of fire while retaining the powerful shells of previous Russian dreadnoughts. That being said, the weight gain due to modernisation negatively impacts her mobility, and modernised armour does not improve her belt nor torpedo protection.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

As the first battleship in the game with World War II refit, the {{PAGENAME}} has an exceptional survivability compared to other World War I dreadnoughts. While most of {{PAGENAME}}'s armour profile remains the same from her sister ship, the [[Poltava]], there are several key changes. Most prominent changes is that her main turret's roof is doubled in thickness (from 76 mm to 152 mm) which made it much harder to disable. The citadel deck armour is also increased up to 76 mm. This increased protection is offset by the change of its fuel from coal to oil, which eliminates the protection from the coal bunkers and made it slightly worse at taking a hit through the armour belt. The vessel is also equipped with torpedo bulges which can protect the sides of the ship from torpedo warheads up to 250 kg of TNT.

The modernisation of the ship increased the displacement of the ship by some 7,000 tons, compared to the WW1-era Poltava, making the Parizhskaya Kommuna sit rather low in the water. While in real life this may be undesirable due to seakeeping issues, this can be a huge benefit to your survivability in War Thunder. Much of the vital components of the ship (such as magazines and engines) are well below the waterline, the ships low profile making them difficult to hit. On the other hand, the low buoyancy of the {{PAGENAME}} also causes her to be highly vulnerable to flooding damage. As the ship will quickly ingest water into the hull once it has been breached either by large torpedoes or a shot below the waterline, her internal modules are at risk of being disabled before the breach has been contained. This, combined with her poor mobility, also makes the {{PAGENAME}} extremely vulnerable to torpedoes, as multiple hits can cause the ship to be quickly flood and sink before the damage can be contained.

The {{PAGENAME}} has a high crew count, this allows her to tank more hits than any other dreadnoughts before going down.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
As expected from a battleship, the {{PAGENAME}} is a slow ship. Although its displacement is increased by a whooping 7,500 tons from its predecessor, the overall agility of the {{PAGENAME}} is decreased only a bit thanks to more efficient oil-powered engines.

{{main|12-inch/52 pattern 1907 (305 mm)}}
The ship is armed with the same set of 305 mm guns as the Imperatritsa Mariya and Poltava, and has access to the same devastating shells. The modernisation of the Parizhskaya Kommuna included an increase to the rate of fire of the main cannons, which have a minimum reload time of 27 seconds. This makes a small but noticeable upgrade to the firepower, as it is able to sling substantially more shells downrange during the course of a regular battle.

* '''12-inch HE patt.1911''' - The stock HE shells have just over 47 kg of TNT filler and are capable of wrecking even the most heavily armoured cruisers. However, it is fairly ineffective at dealing direct damage against most battleships due to the weak armour penetration. Though it can destroy battleships by causing fires, flooding and knocking out the crew, it can take a while to do significant damage and it is usually better to target enemy cruisers when using this shell.

* '''12-inch AP patt.1911''' - The armour-piercing shells have a sizeable level of filler, at 13 kg of TNT, which is roughly equal to or better than most shells of other nations. They maintain good levels of penetration at long distances, letting you penetrate most capital ships with ease. However, though this is a powerful shell by armour-piercing standards, it simply falls short when it comes to dealing damage inside enemy vessels, due to the relatively low filler compared to the SAP shell, which remains the most reliable choice against all surface targets. Only on the rare occasions where you can't get through enemy armour with SAP shells are your AP shells a viable choice.

* '''12-inch SAP patt.1911''' - The SAP is the most devastating shell, with 55 kg of explosive filler and good penetration. At 10 km distance, the shells still retain enough penetration power to enable you to effectively combat practically any ship at any reasonable distance.

* '''12-inch HE patt.1928''' - The Parizhskaya Kommuna also has access to an upgraded HE shell with a much higher muzzle velocity and an increased explosive power with 55 kg of explosive filler.

{{main|120 mm/50 pattern 1905 (120 mm)}}

Parizhskaya Kommuna's secondary armament consists of 16 casemate 120 mm/50 guns, which results in a modest broadside of eight 120 mm guns in practice. Both of the 120 mm shells that are avaliable have quite good explosive filler, though this is counterbalanced by a slow rate of fire. The traversal rates of the casemate guns are adequate for combating other bluewater ships, but may not cope as well with agile torpedo boats at close range. Since the SAP has a greater explosive filler than the HE, as well as penetrative capabilities against destroyers and light cruisers, SAP is the generally better ammunition choice.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|34-K (76 mm)|37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

The Parizhskaya Kommuna is armed with a competent anti-air suite, composed of 6 x 76 mm cannons, 16 x 37 mm autocannons and 12 x 12.7 mm machine guns. All MGs and autocannons are in unprotected single mounts, meaning that they're easily disabled by enemy gunfire or bombs. It's advisable to not bother repairing them while duelling with enemy vessels as you'll be essentially feeding crew out of the armoured citadel and into unprotected mounts that can be taken out by even destroyer-calibre HE.

The 76 mm cannons form your long-range defence, with their timed fuse shells. The filler of the shells is 200 g, but you have 6 of these cannons and the reload isn't terrible, so can keep up a steady stream of flak to keep inbound aircraft dodging, lest they be hit by fragments.

For closer range defence, you have the 37 mm autocannons. The mounts have a decent traverse speed, but the guns themselves are not outstanding, with relatively average accuracy, range and rate of fire, a couple of hits or less can delete enemy fighters. Bombers may take more hits though. 

To top it off, the 12.7 mm MGs are basically there to supplement the 37 mm guns. They're not exactly long range and don't do a lot of damage, their rate of fire being the only thing going for them, but they increase the volume of fire being spewed at enemy planes, which is never a bad thing.

All in all, the Parizhskaya Kommuna can sustain an AA field roughly equivalent to many cruisers. While not in any way exceptional, it is still more than capable of defending against aircraft.

The Parizhskaya Kommuna was the first battleship of the Sevastopol class (also known as Gangut class). Parizhskaya Kommuna completed construction under the name Sevastopol in 1911 under the Imperial Russian Navy, and served in the Baltic Fleet. Sevastopol was largely unaffected by the tumultuous Russian Revolution in 1917 and the Civil War that followed, but suffered significant damage from a fire in 1919. With a reduced crew, Sevastopol was laid up and used as a source of spare parts for her sister ships.

In 1921, the ship was renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna by the new Soviet government. Over the 1920s, Parizhskaya Kommuna underwent a major rebuilding and modernisation at the Baltiysky Zavod shipyard in Leningrad. This included installation of a new flared bow to address her poor seakeeping, as well as upgrades to her armament (particularly bolstering her anti-aircraft armament), armour, and machinery. In 1929, Parizhskaya Kommuna was transferred to the Black Sea Fleet, where she would serve as the fleet flagship through the 1930s.

Following the induction of the Soviet Union into the Second World War in 1941, Parizhskaya Kommuna provided artillery support to Soviet forces defending Sevastopol. The ship survived several German air raids on its moorings in Sevastopol, but was eventually evacuated to Poti on the Black Sea coast as the city fell. Over the next year, Parizhskaya Kommuna participated in several bombardment missions against German forces in Crimea, including the Kerch-Feodosia Amphibious Operation. However, battle damage sustained throughout the campaign would force the ship to undergo periodic repairs. 

In 1943, the ship was renamed back to its original name of Sevastopol and would serve out the rest of the war in a support role, not participating in any major naval action past that point. After the war, the ageing dreadnought was decommissioned in 1956 and subsequently scrapped.
