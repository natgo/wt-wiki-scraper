The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the second ship of the Gangut-class dreadnoughts built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the early 1910s as Russia's first dreadnoughts. She was laid down on 16th June 1909 and commissioned on 30th December 1914. She was tasked with defending the Gulf of Finland from the Germans, but they never attacked so she conducted training missions and covered minelaying ships. Due to the lack of crew in 1918, she was laid up and suffered heavy damage from a fire the following year. She was a parts source for her sister ships and no repair was ever carried out on her. She was struck from the Navy List in 1940 and in late 1941 she was grounded to prevent her sinking by the Germans. Her wreck was refloated in 1944 and subsequently scrapped in 1949.

Poltava was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]]. The Poltava is very similar to the [[Imperatritsa Mariya]], as the latter was a development of the Gangut class. The Poltava features less armour compared to Mariya, with turrets being up to 203 mm thick and barbettes up to 150 mm instead of 250 mm thick armour found on Mariya. The ship is armed with four triple 305 mm guns distributed along the length of the ship. The guns fire either HE, APHEBC, or SAP shells. The SAP shells are one of the best in their class with 55.2 kg TNTeq and up to 223 mm penetration on 10 km range, allowing for destroying or heavily damaging heavy cruisers or even lighter armoured battleships with a single salvo.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Poltava's main armour belt is 225 mm thick and protects the ship along the entire length between turret n°1 and n°4 and also part of the ship under the waterline. Casemates are protected by 125 mm of armour, although these are vulnerable to overpressure and cause significant crew loss when damaged. The deck is 38 mm thick and vulnerable against long range fire from certain ships such as Helena or Brooklyn due to their high angle of fire. Another layer of protection that protects machinery and magazines of turret n°2 and 3 consist of coal bunkers that add another significant protection. The other two magazines are protected by being very low under the waterline, making them very hard to hit and explode. Crew complement consists of 1,125 sailors, which is on par with contemporary battleships and less than more modern heavy cruisers, battlecruisers and battleships.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Poltava, just like her contemporary Imperatritsa Mariya, is powered by coal-fueled engines which unfortunately do not produce enough power for the ship to be somewhat manoeuvrable. It takes a lot of time to reach top speed, rudder takes time to change direction of the ship aswell, but after reaching full tilt, the ship itself manoeuvres well. The maximum reverse speed of 22 km/h can be reached in approximately 25 seconds, while forward maximum speed of 43 km/h can be reached in approximately 40 seconds.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
As with all ships, it is recommended to prioritize the research of Tool Set, Fire Protection System, and SAP and AP shells for main guns, and then SAP shell for secondaries.

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|12-inch/52 pattern 1907 (305 mm)}}

The Poltava is equipped with twelve 12-inch/52 pattern 1907 cannons in four turrets in triple mounts. The Poltava's rate of fire is slightly worse at 1.8 rounds per minute, compared to 2.2 rounds per minute found on the [[Parizhskaya kommuna]]. The cannons can use three types of shells: HE, APCBC and SAPCBC. Unlike the Parizhskaya kommuna, the Poltava does not have access to the better Pattern 1928 HE shell.

{{:12-inch/52 pattern 1907 (305 mm)/Ammunition|12-inch HE patt.1911, 12-inch AP patt.1911, 12-inch SAP patt.1911}}

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|120 mm/50 pattern 1905 (120 mm)}}

Poltava's secondary armament suite consist of sixteen 120 mm guns in casemates with eight on each side of the hull. These guns are good as a filler of gunfire between reloads of main guns, although due to even lower muzzle velocity than the 305 mm guns, these are slightly harder to hit with at distance. The SAP shell is also quite weak, so it is advised to use HE to cause fire on the enemy ship.

{{:120 mm/50 pattern 1905 (120 mm)/Ammunition|120 mm patt.1911 HE, 120 mm patt.1911 SAP}}

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|75 mm/50 Canet patt.1892 (75 mm)|3 pdr QF Hotchkiss (47 mm)}}

Poltava comes equipped with 3 anti-aircraft cannons, namely two 75 mm Canet pattern 1892 guns mounted on roof of turret n°4 while single 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun is mounted on the roof of turret n°1. As these guns are very obsolete, their rate of fire is extremely low and they also are low in number, making them extremely ineffective as protection against any aerial threat. Relying on other ships with much stronger AA suite is advised.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Pattern 1912 (450 mm)}}

The Poltava has access to twelve Pattern 1912 torpedoes. Unfortunately their range without torpedo mode installed is only 2 km so their usage is limited. With a base speed of 80 km/h and small warhead of 100 kg TNTe, they are not very impressive. Installing torpedo mode extends their range to 6 km but decreases their speed in return to 52 km/h. It is advised to remove the torpedoes as they are very weak and dangerous since the torpedo tube can be hit and torpedo explode.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Poltava excels at long range engagements where its 305 mm guns can be utilized to their full potential while still being at a distance so its armour will still matter. Poltava's SAP shell is one of the most potent rounds at top tier so it should be the main round you use. One of the flaws that does not allow for quick switching of targets is the long reload time and the slow turret traverse speed forcing sometimes the player to move the entire ship to aim faster. It is also advised to stay within range of your team's light and heavy cruisers to gain protection from enemy planes as Poltava does not posses adequate AA protection. Captain of Poltava should prioritize engaging USS 6-inch gun equipped cruisers as their high rate of fire allows for constant rain of shells causing fire and inability to repair your vessel. Battleships should be next top priority afterwards.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful main guns with potent SAP shell
* Overall sufficient protection without any major flaw like unprotected magazines
* Quite high crew complement

'''Cons:'''

* Inadequate anti-aircraft protection
* Casemates vulnerable to overpressure
* Long reload paired with slow turret traverse speed
* Subpar mobility

The Poltava was the second Sevastopol-class (alternatively referred to as "Gangut-class") dreadnought battleship to be built for the Imperial Russian Navy prior to the First World War. Poltava was laid down on June 16, 1909 at the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg simultaneously with her sister ship Gangut. She launched on June 27, 1911, and entered service on December 4, 1914.

The design of the Sevastopol-class battleships came after the Russians faced a withering defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, where it became immediately evident that the Russian navy was incapable and required newer and more effective vessels. The Russian Naval Ministry decided that new battleships should be built with greater above-the-waterline protection, as well as have more numerous and more powerful main guns. Thus, the Sevastopol-class was designed with full side armour to protect against HE shells, as well as 12"/52 calibre main guns. That being said, the Sevastopol class lacked some features that contemporary battleships had, such as reinforced underwater protection against torpedoes and mines, as well as superfiring turrets. Additionally, the ships sat low on the water and thus had poor sea-keeping; ocean water would frequently interfere with the optics and operation of guns on the deck of the ships.

The Poltava was built at the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, beginning construction in 1909 and launching in 1911. She had an uneventful start to her career, playing a passive role in World War I by preventing German access to the Gulf of Finland. In the turmoil following the Russian Revolution, Poltava was placed in long-term storage in 1918 due to crew shortages. A fire in 1919 gutted her interior, after which she was used as a source of spare parts for other battleships. Several plans were made in the 1920s to reconstruct Poltava, including a reconstruction as a aircraft carrier, but ultimately funding ran out and work ceased in 1935. Her scrapped hull was used as a floating battery during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II. After the war, some of her gun turrets were installed in coastal batteries that remained in service into the 1990s.
