== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German motor torpedo gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
After grinding the grossly under-powered [[MZ1]], you will be relieved to be at the helm of 206. The 206 is faster and more manoeuvrable with base configuration. One should seriously consider getting rudder upgrade after tools and fire-prevention equipment, as stock rudder is sluggish which makes it difficult to bring torpedoes to target in some of the tighter maps.

''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells.

Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.''

=== Additional armament ===

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-56 (533 mm)|BB-1 depth charge}}

The Pr. 206 is armed with 4 x 1-tube torpedo launchers with '''533 mm 53-56 torpedoes'''. With a relatively heavy warhead of 400 kg, these are your main weapon against heavily armoured threats or when attempting attacks at a distance. Your torpedoes have a max range of 13 km (8 km without torpedo mode) and can be used at close range.

The Pr. 206 can also be armed with '''BB-1 depth charges''', originally intended for use against submarines. It is not recommended to load them in the ship as they do not have any practical use in naval battles.

Note: Near to the roll-off depth charge rack are 4 similar looking cylindrical objects in a side drop rack. These are actually MDSh smoke canisters (Морская дымовая шашка), which weigh 40-45 kg, and have a diameter of 41 cm, and a length of 48 cm. There are 3 versions of the identical canister, BDSh-5, BDSh-15 or MDSh.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Pr. 206 is best used as a backline AA flagship which can dominate the coastal waters with its 30 mm rapid fire cannon. Its radar will make it hard to be caught off guard by pesky aircraft and the armament will be more than enough to decimate anything in its BR. The ship can also tear through most coastal vehicles except frigates. Be advised, the ship is not well armoured owing to the Cold War doctrines of ships from that era as well as to the closely packed crew compartments. this ship is best placed in a comfortable buffer behind cover where it can still fire or near an allied frigate or destroyer which could distract enemy vessels. Trigger discipline is necessary when using the vessel as the main armament chews through the 2,000 rounds, especially when broadside. Therefore, the guns should be fired in no more than a one second burst at any target except when absolutely necessary.

The biggest threats to the Pr. 206 are autocannons, guided missiles, and larger vessels. Larger vessels should be avoided, especially frigates such as the Soviet SKRs. Their rapid-firing armament can quickly destroy the vessel and their armour allows them to shrug off the 30 mm. In the event where frigates can't be avoided, taking out the main gun should be a priority. Guided missiles, however, are potentially the most dangerous threat as vehicles such as the Saetta P-494 can engage the Pr. 206 at any distance within range of their missiles. The best option is using cover and wait until the vessel becomes distracted.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast-firing effective armament with 360° of traverse
* Access to radar
* Four torpedo tubes

'''Cons:'''

* Weak armour
* Low crew count
* No dedicated AP belts
* Low ammo count with no way to restock supply except when one of the armaments are fully depleted

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Project 206, also known under the NATO reporting name as the "Shershen-class", was a class of Soviet Cold War-era torpedo boats developed in the late 1950s as a replacement for the Project 183 "Bolshevik". The new Project 206 was designed with similar principles in mind as the Bolshevik, those being cheap production costs and easy maintenance. Furthermore, the Project 206 torpedo boats, similarly to the design that preceded it, were meant to be used close to the shoreline and in fair weather.

The first boat of the class was completed and commissioned with the Soviet Navy in 1960. Three Soviet shipyards produced the Project 206-class torpedo boats in USSR, but few of them have been delivered to Yugoslavia in parts and their assembly was carried out on place by Yugoslav workers. The Project 206-class torpedo boats were used by, beside the Soviet Navy, Eastern Germany, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Egypt, Vietnam, North Korea and several other nations using only a small number of vessels. The Project 206 was mostly decommissioned from active service with most operators by the 1990s, although Egypt and Vietnam still used some Project 206s in the 2000s.
