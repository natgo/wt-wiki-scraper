== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet motor torpedo gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Pr. 206 has an inexistent armour which barely stops .50 cal. Crew count is not great as well as spacing. Overall, the survivability is really limited and lacklustre. However, the best survivability technique is to not even be fired at. Thanks to the ship's profile, it is able to perform agile manoeuvres and hide in places in which not every ship would look at, specially big ships like destroyers. A single salvo from a destroyer is more than enough to completely destroy the Pr. 206 so do not rely on the armour.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Overall, the Pr. 206, while being a heavy patrol boat, has decent speed as well as decent agility. While it is not able to perform like other smaller patrol boats, it is able to perform better than any bigger ship, even the coastal frigates and fast attack crafts.

Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|AK-230 (30 mm)}}

The Pr. 206 is armed with 2 double-barrel turrets, the AK-230. These weapons have their pros and cons when it comes to facing ships and aircraft. While it is not able to destroy heavily armoured targets, it is able to decimate aircraft and lightly armoured targets within seconds because of their rate of fire. Due to having quadruple AK-230s, while having less rate of fire individually compared to the AK-630 (rate of fire is similar to the [[Falcon]] SPAA), it has a combined RPM of 4,000. Sadly, the only ammunition available is an HE/AP belt with an incendiary variant. As it only has a single AP round every 3 HE rounds, killing armoured targets will be tricky, but this is somewhat compensated by the RPM. The tremendous rotation speed (30°/s) make the turrets able to engage multiple targets one after each other with high speeds, they are also able to track and follow up even the fastest planes.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-56 (533 mm)|BB-1 depth charge}}

The Pr. 206 is armed with 4 single-tube torpedo launchers. These are your main weapon against heavily armoured threats or when doing sneak attacks at distance. They have a max range of 8 km (13 km with torpedo mode) and can be used at almost point-blank, the torpedo must travel 50 m at minimum to be armed (most of the time "point-blank" engagements will be between 100-500 m). Depending on the map, game mode and captain's discretion, torpedo depth can be adjusted in order to achieve multiple tasks. However, the launchers are fixed to the hull, meaning the hull has to be turned in order to launch the torpedoes.

'''1-meter depth''' - This is the most universal depth used for all types of engagements, being in deep water or at shallow waters. This depth is capable of hitting all sorts of vessels, including PT boats. The main downside is that enemy ships can see the water trail made by the torpedo, which can make enemy vessels evade or fire at the torpedo.

'''4-meter depth''' - This is the recommended depth when on deep water trying to do long range sneaky engagements to big ships (most of them have bulkheads more than 4 m under the waterline). This is one of the riskier techniques as there is no way to launch them on shallow waters (most shallow water maps have water depth of 2-3 m). Only the captain and the team will be able to see the torpedo symbol while traveling close to them, and it will not leave any visible water trail compared to the 1-meter depth torpedo.

The Pr. 206 has access to BB-1 depth charges, but these are useless in the current state of the game.

=== Radar ===
[[File:Pr. 206 radars.png|thumb|Red: MR-102 search radarBlue: MR-104 fire control radar]]
The Pr. 206 has access to the MR-102 air/surface search radar and MR-104 fire control radar (FCR). The MR-102 is located on top of the main mast. MR-104 are located at the back of the ship on top of the superstructure behind the main mast. Enemy pilots are often unaware of the presence of the radar as they are uncommon in-game, use surprise to your advantage. Radars can give you a huge advantage with situational awareness, as no plane will be able to catch you unsuspected. Be aware of radar interference (mountains, trees, tall structures in general) as they will affect both your search and tracking radar. There are blind spots with the radars which pilots can exploit, but most of them will not do so as radars are uncommon in battles. As previously stated, tracking radar can be used to manually engage targets. It is recommended to use tracking radar when engaging immediate threats and air targets in general, as it has no access to gunners.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
As a patrol boat with heavy firepower, it is able to dominate the steep waters of any match, not only because of the RPM but also because of the radar. However, the Pr. 206 should not be used as a frontline vessel, as every single vessel it will face will have more than enough firepower to destroy it in seconds. The torpedo can be formidable if used correctly, not only for the fact they are able to destroy whatever it hits, but also because they are hard to aim due to the distances the Pr. 206 has to navigate in order to get into a decent launch distance. The 30 mm should be used always to sink everything but heavily armoured ships. They are able to decimate light vessels in seconds, as well as planes. For this same reason, the Pr. 206 should be used as an anti-air flagship, as it is able to detect and engage enemy planes in a range of 130 km. Absolutely no aircraft will surprise it while the search radar is active. The Pr. 206, when used in Enduring Confrontation events, is the most reliable and "Jack-of-All-Trades" ship seen in-game. Not only because it is able to dominate the skies, but also because it is able to decimate enemy convoys within seconds with the firepower and torpedoes, specially if said convoys are unarmed cargo ships.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to radar
* Good firepower
* High speed turret rotation
* Reaches top speed within seconds

'''Cons:'''

* No armour whatsoever
* Small crew complement
* The 30 mm guns are quickly depleted
* Closed and tightly packed crew compartments

The Pr. 206, NATO reporting name Shershen-Class, was a class of torpedo boats built for the Soviet navy during the 1960s. Designed as a replacement for the Pr. 183 class, the ships were fitted with considerable armament for their size. Many ships of the class were built for both Soviet and foreign service; some vessels remain in service with foreign navies to this day.

The Pr. 206 was designed as a replacement to the previous Pr. 183 "Bolshevik"-class with similar capabilities: the ships were designed to operate in coastal waters close to friendly naval and air units. The ships displaced 172 tons full-load and had a crew of 24; the armament consisted of two AK-230 gun mounts, guided by the ship's "Drum Tilt" radar, along with four 533 mm torpedo tubes capable of firing anti-shipping torpedoes with rudimentary homing ability. The Pr. 206s were usually fitted with a single quadruple 9M32 MANPAD (man-portable) surface-to-air missile mount for short range anti-air defence.

In total, 123 Pr. 206 boats were built, including 87 ships built for the Soviet Navy (between 1960 and 1970 at the Zelenodolsk and Yaroslavl shipyards, the rest being exported). As with many Soviet light vessel designs, the Pr. 206 was widely exported to countries including Angola, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Congo, Egypt, East Germany, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia. Twelve additional boats of the Pr. 206E subclass, featuring simplified technologies, were exported to foreign navies. The Pr. 206 has now been retired from Russian service. However, some vessels remain in service with the Egyptian, Vietnamese, and North Korean navies.
