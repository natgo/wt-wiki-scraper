== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet armoured gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

As an ''armoured gun boat'', the ship's structure has some considerable armour for the type outside its armament, at least enough to resist against small-arms fire and shrapnel. No matter how thick the armour is, though, they do cover nearly all critical modules in the ship from stray fire except the transmission and steering gear at the rear.

'''Armour type:'''

* Hardened armour
* Antifragmentation armour (Fuselage roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Cannon turrets)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility}}

The Pr.1124 early isn't particularly nimble for its size. It has a top speed of 39 km/h in RB and slightly higher in AB, which makes it relatively fast for a gunboat but still very slow compared to the MTBs that it often faces. The ship's turning circle is also rather weak, and the rudder isn't very responsive.

Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|F-34 (76 mm)}}

The Pr.1124 early is equipped with two 76 mm T-34 turrets, essentially using the same guns as used on the T-34 tank. These guns are fairly large for this BR, but they require a different strategy than a typical torpedo boat owing to it having a decent reload time. You cannot just spray bullets with this ship; you must aim for certain modules with a greater precision than if you could just use a machine gun. When a good hit occurs, it usually causes a considerable amount of damage to the opposing ship, and may even cause hull-breaks against smaller ships. HE is the recommended ammo for this gun, as most ships at this BR have low to no armour and are vulnerable to explosives.

{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

With two standard-issue 12.7 mm DShK machine guns as its only armaments supplementing the 76 mm turrets, the Pr.1124 early is vulnerable to savvy torpedo boats and other nimble opponents, particularly at close range. Hitting fast-moving targets with the 76 mm guns can be a significant challenge, and the long reload times compared to lower-calibre automatic weapons give only a handful of opportunities for aim adjustment. As these machine guns pull double-duty as AAA, they're also often unavailable for naval targeting. Proceed accordingly, being cautious to avoid engaging enemies who fall into this ship's mid-range weaponry blind spot.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Pr.1124 early is quite an interesting ship to play, due to its unique set of characteristics - heavy armament, good armour, and bad manoeuvrability. This ship excels at longer range combat, making full use of its super-heavy main armament.

'''Tactics:'''

The Pr.1124 early can work very well in certain situations, particularly longer-range engagements. This is because of its two 76 mm main cannons. While they don't fire particularly fast, they hit very hard and can do a lot of damage to naval targets. Assuming you have decent accuracy, you can easily sink any ships at the Pr.1124 early's BR with a couple of shots. The Pr.1124 early also carries a single dual 12.7 mm DShK machine gun turret which provides some measure of anti-aircraft defence. Note that the anti-aircraft armament is otherwise bare, meaning that the ship is very poorly defended from aerial threats.

The Pr.1124 early is quite survivable for a ship of its size, with 20 crew members and some anti-fragmentation armour on the hull, which can provide a limited measure of protection against small arms fire. However, the ship's survivability should not be relied upon, as the ship will be shredded by any heavier weapons carried by larger vessels at its BR. The ship should make use of available land cover to protect the vessel from enemy fire and preserve survivability.

Finally, the Pr. 1124 suffers from a rather mediocre manoeuvrability, with a poor turning circle and a rather disappointing top speed of 39 km/h in RB. Thus, the ship cannot be relied upon to capture zones, as it will take ages just to get to the capture point. In general, this ship should be played as a longer-range sniper, maximising the use of its powerful armament.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Two 76 mm turrets provide excellent long-range firepower capable of penetrating any vessel at its BR
* Turret layout allows firing of main guns in a 360° radius around player
* Turrets rotate surprisingly quickly
* Gets a pair of 12.7 mm machine guns that can provide some measure of anti-aircraft defence
* Quite survivable with 20 crew members and a decent amount of armour
* Small silhouette, making it harder to hit than its contemporaries

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely vulnerable to air attack- two 12.7 mm machine guns with limited fields of fire are your only hope
* Shallow draft makes hitting targets on rough waters nigh-on impossible
* Not too fast, with a top speed of 39 km/h in RB
* Guns have limited traverse arcs, meaning only one gun can fire directly forwards or backwards
** Guns are not well-suited for hitting fast torpedo boats due to their slow reload speed

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
