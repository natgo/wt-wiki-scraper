== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a further development of the [[Pr.1124 early|Pr.1124]] in 1943-1944, with an improved main turret housing the [[F-34 (76 mm)|76 mm F-34 cannons]], and an additional [[37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)|37 mm/67 70-K]] autocannon.

This boat was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game. There is no difference in terms of performance compared to the previous model, the [[Pr.1124 early]]. However, the additional autocannon makes this boat more dangerous to lightly armoured targets, as it can easily destroy them with a few good hits.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour. -->
As an armoured gun boat, the ship's structure has some considerable armour for the type outside its armament, at least enough to resist against small-arms fire and shrapnel. The hull is armoured with 7-14 mm of anti-fragmentation armour, while the turrets have a significant 53 mm of cast homogeneous armour. The superstructure is armoured with 8-10 mm of anti-fragmentation armour as well. However, note that this armour doesn't provide any measure of protection against fire from larger cannons capable of firing AP ammunition (i.e. 20 mm and above), meaning that the ship's survivability should not be solely relied upon.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed. -->
The Pr.1124 late isn't particularly nimble for its size. It has a top speed of 39 km/h in RB and 53 km/h in AB (identical to the previous Pr.1124), which makes it relatively fast for a gunboat but still very slow compared to the MTBs that it faces often. The ship's turning circle is also rather weak, and the rudder isn't very responsive. Overall agility isn't too great, meaning that captains should rely on the ship's other characteristics to win fights against enemy ships.

{{main|F-34 (76 mm)}}

The Pr.1124 late is equipped with two 76 mm F-34 cannons, which are the exact same ones that are fitted on its predecessor, the Pr.1124 early. These are very powerful cannons that can knock out all light torpedo boats with a single shot (notably, the LS 3, most of American tier I boats, and the G-5 in mixed battles). However, the reload time doesn't allow you to rush into the battlefield, like all the torpedo motorboats. At this stage, you should know to target engines or ammunition blocks to increase the chance of knocking out or significantly impairing the enemy. You shouldn't have much trouble aiming, though, because the F-34 cannons shoot rounds at high speeds, unlike the MO-4, for example.

In terms of ammunition, it is advised to carry HE for the majority of encounters, but also take some AP to use against tougher opponents (at battle ratings 3.0 and 3.3, for instance). Don't take full ammunition, because at this battle rating, your opponents should know where to shoot.

If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)}}

The major difference between the Pr.1124 early and late is the secondary armament. This boat is equipped with a 37 mm 70-K cannon, which should be your weapon of choice for close encounters, because of its fast reload rate and turret rotation speed. It also shines in messy fights, where you have to defend yourself from enemies all around yourself (although, you shouldn't find yourself in such situations often).

In general terms, this 37 mm cannon should be used similarly to the one on the BMO, which you have likely played before this boat. The only difference is that in an up-tier, you have to play much more passive.

If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

The twin 12.7 mm DShK machine guns remain the same as on the Pr.1124 early, but now should be used exclusively for aircraft, because the enemies at this battle rating are likely not going to be susceptible to light machine gun fire. However, one benefit of having these guns placed on top of the bridge is that they are rarely taken out, which allows you to continue fighting back your enemies even when your other armaments are knocked out (it won't be very effective, though).

The Pr.1124 late is quite an interesting ship to play, due to its unique set of characteristics - heavy armament, good armour, and bad manoeuvrability. This ship excels at longer range combat, making full use of its super-heavy main armament.

'''Tactics:'''

The Pr.1124 late can work very well in certain situations, particularly longer-range engagements. This is because of its great main weapons, namely two 76 mm cannons. While they don't fire particularly fast, they hit very hard and can do a lot of damage to naval targets. Assuming you have decent accuracy, you can easily sink any ships at the Pr.1124's BR with a couple of shots. However, the main upgrade from the previous Pr.1124 is the anti-aircraft armament: the Pr.1124 late gets access to a 37 mm 70-K automatic cannon along with the existing dual 12.7 mm machine gun turret. This combination provides a formidable amount of AA protection and can shred apart most aircraft that the ship commonly faces.

The Pr.1124 late is quite survivable for a ship of its size, with 20 crew members and some anti-fragmentation armour on the hull, which can provide a limited measure of protection against small arms fire. However, the ship's survivability should not be relied upon, as the ship will be shredded by any heavier weapons carried by larger vessels at its BR. The ship should make use of available land cover to protect the vessel from enemy fire and preserve survivability.

Finally, the Pr.1124 late suffers from a rather mediocre manoeuvrability, with a poor turning circle and a rather disappointing top speed of 39 km/h in RB. Thus, the ship cannot be relied upon to capture zones, as it will take ages just to get to the capture point. In general, this ship should be played as a longer-range sniper, maximising the use of its powerful armament.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* T-34 turrets can do serious damage with both HE and APHE
* 37 mm and twin 12.7 mm guns provide a formidable rear-aspect AA defence
* 37 mm is capable of shredding apart most ships you will face
* T-34 turrets are well armoured, making them very difficult to disable
* Excellent close range burst damage potential

'''Cons:'''

* Slow, with a top speed of 39 km/h in RB
* Turrets tend to bounce up and down, making sustained fire difficult
* Rear 76 mm turret has very limited coverage of the ship's frontal arc
* 37 mm offers virtually no coverage of the frontal region
* HMG and autocannon fire can easily result in loss of crew or even ammo rack damage
* 76 mm shell velocity and reload speed can make long range combat difficult

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction.
