== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet armoured gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game. It bears strong resemblance to the [[Pr.1124 (1940)]], and inherits its main gun and its tactics.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The turret is the most heavily armoured section of the ship, with 15 mm of RHA, meaning that it cannot be knocked out by HE shells under 100 mm in calibre. In addition, the bridge and Automatic Grenade Launchers are protected by a thin layer of hardened armour, making them more resistant against low-calibre HE. However, this armour is insufficient to stop large-calibre autocannon fire or armour-piercing machine gun rounds.

In addition, there is an armoured compartment protecting the engine. This gives some resistance against engine knockouts, which will help the stock grind (before FPE).

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The ship has a moderate top speed both forward and reverse, meaning that you will never be the first to capture points. Your stopping time is also somewhat poor, and so to turn round it would be better to do a U-turn in most cases. However, your rudder speed is good, and gets much better with the modification installed, so avoiding torpedoes is not an issue for the Pr. 1204.

{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|D-56TS (76 mm)}}

The primary armament is roughly the same as the Pr. 1124, and offers no new shell types. It is conveniently mounted on the bow of the boat, with a blind spot directly behind the boat. Being moderately armoured, it is rarely knocked out. HE shells are sufficient against most boats, but it is sensible to carry some APHE as well, especially to face some Russian armoured boats, where your 11 mm of penetration with HE rounds won't be enough.

Use HE whenever possible, especially at longer ranges, because the APHE needs a solid hit to damage anything.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2M-3 (25 mm)}}

The dual 25 mm turret tears aircraft apart in a few hits, and it can help against very fast PT boats. A small group of these boats together with a destroyer have a decent combined AA.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|BP "Plamya" (30 mm)}}

The "anti-air" armament of 4 x 30 mm grenade launchers is largely ineffective at ranges of over 1 km. It is useful, however, in close quarters fighting (though not recommended), or for fending off patrol boats that get too close, something that is very challenging with only the main gun. This is a major improvement over the Pr. 1124, which had to use its 12.7 mm machine guns for this, leaving it vulnerable to the air.

Note that the grenade launchers are classified as AA, but the true AA is your 25 mm gun, which you can use against pretty much anything.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|BM-14-17|YAM-43 mine}}

Like prior Soviet river boats, there is an option to mount a Katyusha rocket launcher on the back. This can be effective against large or static targets, making up for the lack of torpedoes.

Note: this artillery rocket launcher has a larger calibre than others in the tech tree. This allows you to fire up to 17 rockets 3 km away, very effective against destroyers.

You also have the option to carry a few mines. These mines are very small, and were designed to be used in rivers. Using them against destroyers has very little effect, even several of them. These should be used against other PT boats, but are not really worth the trouble.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Pr. 1204 late is very similar in playstyle to the [[Pr.1124 (1940)]], which you will have played before this boat. Remaining at long range is still important due to your thin armour, however more ships have guns capable of engaging at range at the higher BR. You have better defence against fast and evasive enemies and air power thanks to your 25 mm AA gun and the 30 mm grenade launchers, but these can be easily overwhelmed by large numbers of enemies. You are also still relatively flammable, and going into close-quarters battle is not recommended.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has a 30 mm grenade launcher weapon for defence in close quarter battles
* Effective AA turret
* Powerful main gun
* Rocket launcher, highly effective on a hit
* Moderate armour protects well against small arms fire
* Good turn rate to avoid torpedoes

'''Cons:'''

* 30 mm grenade launcher has short range
* Only one AA turret, easily overwhelmed
* Only one main gun, unlike Pr. 1124
* Rocket launcher is very difficult to hit with (similar to [[MO-4]])
* Armour is insufficient against 20 mm autocannons present on many boats at this BR
* Low top speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Pr.1204 (or "Shmel") class of river boats were developed in the mid 1960s as a successor to the USSR's ageing fleet of WWII era river boats. 118 Shmel class river boats were built between 1967 and 1974. The boats were designed specifically to operate in shallow waters, such as rivers or littoral waters. The Shmel class was designed to support operations in rivers or shallow water conditions such as denying waterway passages, protecting harbours supporting troop movements, as well as providing fire support for ship to shore scenarios. As of 2017, several are still in service with the Russian Navy, with at least 4 assigned to the Caspian fleet.<ref>https://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/detail.asp?ship_id=shmel-class-artillery-gunboat-soviet-union</ref>
