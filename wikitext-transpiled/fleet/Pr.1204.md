=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

The Pr.1204 (or "Shmel") class of river boats were developed in the mid 1960's as a successor to the USSR's aging fleet of WWII era river boats. 118 Shmel class river boats were built between 1967 and 1974. The boats were designed specifically to operate in shallow waters, such as rivers or littoral waters. The Shmel class was designed to support operations in rivers or or shallow water conditions such as denying waterway passages, protecting harbors supporting troop movements, as well as providing fire support form ship to shore scenarios.<ref name=":0">https://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/detail.asp?ship_id=shmel-class-artillery-gunboat-soviet-union</ref> As of 2017,several are still in service with the Russian Navy<ref name=":0" />, with at least 4 assigned to the Caspian fleet.
