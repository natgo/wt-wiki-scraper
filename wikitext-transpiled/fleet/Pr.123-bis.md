== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''Pr.123-bis''' is a production variant of the Project 123 Komsomolet-class Torpedo Boat used by the Soviet Navy during World War II. Development of Project 123 originally began in 1939, but the urgent need to replace the previous model due to the unsatisfactory performance of the [[G-5]] motor torpedo boat arose in 1942. In 1943, the navy approved the production model of the project, resulting in the designation Project 123-bis. It was equipped with two twin 12.7 mm [[DShK (12.7 mm)|DShK]] heavy machine guns and utilized two American-supplied Packard petrol engines acquired through the Lend-Lease program.

This boat was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game. Its gameplay is similar to many other MTBs in the game, but its superior speed allows it to swiftly capture strategic points and eliminate enemy boats attempting to reach your capture point thanks to its armament who consist of two twin 12.7 mm DShK heavy machine guns. As a torpedo boat, it also carries two [[45-36NU]] torpedoes, useful for targeting slow-moving vessels or lower-ranked destroyers or frigates. Additionally, it can carry [[BM-1 small depth charge|BM-1]] small depth charges, although their explosive power is insufficient to destroy enemy destroyers or frigates outright, they can still damage or destroy enemy boats with one or two depth charges.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
[[File:Pr123bis.png|thumb|X-Ray view of the Pr.123bis showing key components that are prone to be damaged when taking enemy fire.]]
The Pr.123bis doesn't have any armour in the game. When under fire, it is almost certain that an opponent will disable your engines and/or set you on fire (see image on the right). However, you will very rarely be destroyed due to an ammunition explosion.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Pr.123bis can reach speeds over 120 km/h in AB and around 90 km/h in RB and SB. Backwards, the Pr.123bis can reach -45 km/h, so there should be no trouble reaching strategic points first or at the same time as the lighter boats. The Pr.123bis turns very quickly, a tactic which should be used to flank opponents and destroy them with machine guns. Lastly, it is unwise to come to a full stop, due to the fact the ship becomes a "sitting duck", easy to pick off by enemy ships or aircraft.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

Primary armament composes of two, dual mounted [[DShK (12.7 mm)|DShK]] heavy machine gun turrets, with one located at the stern and the other at the centre of the vessel just above and behind the bridge. Note that the turret at the stern is obstructed when pointed towards the bow due to the other turret, therefore somewhat restricting fire coverage. The turret just behind the bridge has near 360°, though it is slightly obstructed by the mast when pointing towards the bow.

The DShK 12.7 mm guns provide good firepower and rate of fire against similarly sized ships and somewhat larger ships thanks to its heavy calibre. They have an ammunition capacity of 1,000 rounds, with reloads taking ~4.7 seconds. Available belts to research include the high explosive incendiary (HEI) and armour piercing incendiary tracer (APIT) rounds.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|45-36NU (450 mm)|BM-1 small depth charge}}

The Pr.123bis carries two 450 mm wet-heating 45-36NU torpedoes. They have a range of 3 km at a speed of 78 km/h or a range of 6 km at 73 km/h with the Torpedo Mode module installed. They are placed at the bow of the boat and fired out already at speed, so you can surprise your opponents with your torpedoes, unlike early American boats, which simply throw the torpedoes to their sides.

''Be careful with your torpedoes!'' Due to torpedoes being fired out of their tubes at an upwards angle, this means that your torpedoes might over-shoot (literally) any boats which are passing right in front of the Pr.123bis.

The Pr.123bis can carry 6 x BM-1 small depth charges, which can be used as timed mines to damage/destroy tougher enemies. You can place depth charges around a capture point if you get there first, or in front of an enemy.

''Remember'' to set your Depth Charge activation time before battle, if you carry depth charges. The default option of 3 seconds is too short to be useful, so it is advised to set it to something between 5-8 seconds to keep your options open.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Pr.123bis is one of the first Soviet boats that get decent firepower, which can destroy its opponents very quickly. Moreover, it gets two torpedoes, which are fired forwards at speed (can be an advantage, but also a disadvantage). All of that weaponry is placed on a motorboat which can reach very high speeds. It's a boat that will help you grind out USSR rank I fleet.

The Pr.123bis strikes a balance between speed and weaponry. At its low battle rating, the two dual 12.7 mm machine guns reliably destroy all light boats, experiencing difficulty only in a full uptier. For the most part, the Pr.123bis should be used as a flanker. Your machine guns destroy compartments with 3-5 bursts, and if you get the first shot on most of your opponents, they are most likely going to die very soon after. However, if you meet tougher opponents, it is viable to simply cross the map around the flank, (ignoring the lighter boats) while the opponents are focused on their front, and fire your torpedoes at their sides (best done when up close and personal).

As a rule of thumb, you should never remain stationary. The Pr.123bis doesn't have any armour, and all other boats at its battle rating can kill it, so to make it much more difficult for the opponents, try to stay at your top speed and avoid head-on encounters. Although, you can still handle some threats from the sides because your guns' rotation speeds are very fast.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent firepower with four DShK machine guns, enough to deal with most ships at its BR
** Good firing angles and turret rotation speeds for the machine guns
* Extremely good mobility - very high top speed and snappy rudder response
* Access to torpedoes which fire forwards at speed

'''Cons:'''

* Terrible survivability even for an MTB, with only seven crew members
* Only has two torpedoes, which aren't particularly good torpedoes either
** Torpedo tubes are fixed, only being able to fire forwards
* Guns tend to bob up and down when travelling at top speed, making aiming extremely difficult

The Pr.123bis was the first variant of the Pr.123 series of motor torpedo boats built by the Soviet navy during and shortly after the Second World War. Originally intended to carry a single machine gun mount, the ship was instead fitted with two 12.7 mm machine gun turrets and two heavy torpedo tubes. As well, the ships were fitted with American Packard-built engines, enabling a higher top speed. The Pr.123bis was produced from 1942 - in total, 118 ships were built before the ship was replaced by the later Pr.123K.

The Pr.123bis was the first major upgrade of the original Pr.123 design. The ship was considerably improved over the original Pr.123 in several ways. The most noticeable addition was the installation of a second dual 12.7 mm DShK machine gun installation on top of the deckhouse, which offered a dramatic increase in firepower compared to the original Pr.123. As well, the ship used lend-lease Packard aircraft engines imported from the United States, each developing 1,200 hp. Despite the heavier engines, the ship was actually slower than the Pr.123, as the added weight of the weapons and equipment weighed the hull down.

The first Pr.123bis was built in 1942, and was accepted for production shortly thereafter. Being constructed by Plant No. 639 in Tyumen, a total of 118 ships were built. The first ship entered service in 1944, while the last boats were accepted in service in 1955. Many Pr.123bis boats were exported to Warsaw pact allies. In service, the Pr.123bis was complemented and succeeded by the more advanced Pr.123K, featuring improved systems and armament. The last Pr.123bis ships were retired in the 1970s and 1980s, replaced by more modern torpedo boats and small ships.
