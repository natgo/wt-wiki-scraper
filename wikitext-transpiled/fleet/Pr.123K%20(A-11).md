== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the fleet release into open beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

This boat has no armour, and relies upon small size and fast speed for survival. Turning away after dropping torpedoes and hiding behind smoke should be standard tactics.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Pr 123K (A-11) is the fastest boat in the game - getting to 135/136kph in Arcade Battles. This makes it very useful for capturing zones that are some distance from the main battle area.

The vessel loses a lot of speed when making anything more than minimal turns, like all hydrofoils. However, it has very good acceleration, allowing sharp turns to be a normal part of your tactics.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|KPV (14.5 mm)}}

The Pr.123K has dual [[KPV (14.5 mm)|14.5 mm KPV]] machine guns mounted at the stern, giving a very wide angle of fire, excluding a relatively small angle either side of straight ahead.

However, the KPV is a very powerful gun, and with API ammunition it can do considerable internal and crew damage, destroying any other small boat in the game with 2-3 reloads, and even significantly reducing the crew of much larger vessels such as destroyers. Effective use of the guns requires good understanding of lead and aiming offsets for speed and angle - opponents will often not adequately compensate for your speed, while you can be causing damage at ranges up to 1.5 km.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|45-36NU (450 mm)|BB-1 depth charge}}

The Pr.123bis carries two 450 mm wet-heating 45-36NU torpedoes. They have a range of 3 km at a speed of 78 km/h or a range of 6 km at 73 km/h with the Torpedo Mode module installed. They are placed at the bow of the boat and fired out at the same speed the boat is already travelling at.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Pr.123K (A-11), as a premium variant of the Pr.123K "Komsomolets", is relatively under-armed with two machine guns placed in a position that forces you to expose your side to shoot. However, this armament is still enough to do plenty of damage, which can be combined with the ship's excellent mobility to make use of ambush / hit-and-run tactics.

The Pr.123K does best in base-capturing abilities, as it can easily reach bases before most other boats. Thus, at the start of each game, you should rush straight for the bases. After the bases are captured, you can move into ambush tactics, as the Pr.123K has relatively weak survivability and will be shredded in any brawls. Thus, you have to play very carefully, and always stay at speed, or you will get picked off very quickly by gun boats with large guns. You should be the person to capture points for your team, and stay a nuisance for the enemies.

Against smaller vessels such as MTBs, the two 14.5 mm machine guns are usually more than enough. However, note that these guns will bob considerably when travelling at high speeds, making aiming extremely difficult. Thus, ambush tactics are important - the boat who shoots first will almost always win the engagement. You should try to ambush other MTBs who are already distracted in order to maximize your ship's survivability. Against larger destroyers, the Pr.123 gets two large torpedoes which are typically enough to knock out anything up to the size of a destroyer - make use of these torpedoes to get rid of larger vessels such as early destroyers.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely mobile with a high maximum speed and good mobility
** Very small silhouette which can be combined with the ship's great mobility to make it almost untouchable at longer ranges
* Two 14.5 mm machine guns pack more punch than expected
* Gets access to two torpedoes to destroy ships that the guns cannot take care of
** Torpedoes fire forward at speed

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely weak survivability even for a motor torpedo boat, with just seven crew members
** Hull is made of wood and is extremely prone to fires
* Only a single machine gun turret, which cannot fire directly forward due to its positioning
* Only two torpedoes compared to four on many comparable MTBs, which can only fire forward

== History ==
<!-- Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History) and add a link to it here using the main template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <ref></ref>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <references />.

'''Pr.123K (A-11)''' is a prototype variant of the Pr.123K, being the last series of Pr.123 motor torpedo boats built by the Soviet navy during and shortly after the Second World War. The ship differed from previous Pr.123 versions due to the removal of one 12.7 mm DShK machine gun turret, the installation of a heavier 14.5 mm machine gun turret, and the installation of two Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF) and target search radars. The A-11 vessel was a unique Pr.123K prototype fitted with a double hydrofoil, allowing it to attain 56 knots (103 km/h) during testing.

The Pr.123K (A-11) was modified from the Pr.123K subclass of Pr.123 MTBs, and retained the bulk of the Pr.123K's equipment. The ship features an open bridge, similar to the Pr.123K, which housed the steering and control equipment. As well, the Pr.123K (A-11) was fitted with the "Zarnitsa" air-search radar and the "Fakel-M" IFF device, mounted on a dome behind the bridge. The Pr.123K (A-11) was equipped with the same engines as the previous Pr.123K, but was fitted with a dual hydrofoil. This setup enabled the vessel to reach exceptionally-high speeds: 56 knots (103 km/h) during testing.

The Pr.123K (A-11) was built by the Krasnoye Sormovo plant (chief designer RE Alekseev) in 1950. However, despite the higher speed offered by the hydrofoil, the ship was ultimately not accepted into service. Instead, the standard Pr.123K was mass-produced, and served in both domestic and international navies for several decades.
