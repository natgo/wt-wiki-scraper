== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Pr.123K, like the majority of PT boats, has no armour. As this is a boat of the same class as its predecessor in-game (Pr.123bis), it has the same vulnerabilities - easily destroyed engines and frequent fires.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The Pr.123K has excellent mobility that is very comparable to the reserve G-5 torpedo boat. This ship has an magnificent top speed of 120+ km/h in AB, as well as great acceleration and snappy rudder response. These factors combine with the Pr.123K's small silhouette to make the ship almost impossible to hit at longer ranges - this plays as its biggest advantage, which leads to a sort of "hit and run" playstyle. If you have mastered the playstyle of the G-5 reserve torpedo boat, you will master the Pr.123 easily.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|KPV (14.5 mm)}}

The Pr.123K has half the number of machine guns of the Pr.123bis, but they have a larger calibre (dual 14.5 mm KPV machine guns). This is generally a disadvantage at this battle rating, because the vast majority of boats you will face will have no armour and so volume of fire is more important than the power of the ammunition.

However, the KPV is a very powerful gun, and with API ammunition it can do considerable internal and crew damage, destroying any other small boat in the game with 2-3 reloads, and even significantly reducing the crew of much larger vessels such as destroyers.  Effective use of the guns requires good understanding of lead and aiming offsets for speed and angle - opponents will often not adequately compensate for your speed, while you can be causing damage at ranges up to 1.5 km.

The guns are mounted in the stern, giving a very wide angle of fire, excluding a relatively small angle either side of straight ahead.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|45-36NU (450 mm)|BB-1 depth charge}}

The Pr.123K is equipped with 2 x 450 mm wet-heating 45-36NU torpedoes, which are placed on the sides of the boat. When released, they are fired forwards already at speed, which allows you to get a jump on any opponents who are in the torpedo range. It is a good idea to rush tougher opponents and fire your torpedoes very close to them to guarantee a hit (use this tactic at higher battle ratings to get rid of the toughest ships).

The Pr.123K can carry 4 BB-1 depth charges, which can be used as time-based mines or as traps for opponents who are circling you. It is advised to read the [[BB-1 depth charge|full BB-1 article]] which covers its uses in more depth.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Pr.123K can seem as a downgrade from the previous Pr.123bis, with two less machine guns placed in a position that forces you to expose your side to shoot. However, the ship does have a more powerful set of guns, which can be combined with the ship's excellent mobility to make use of ambush / hit-and-run tactics.

The Pr.123K does best in base-capturing abilities, as it can easily reach bases before most other boats. Thus, at the start of each game, you should rush straight for the bases. After the bases are captured, you can move into ambush tactics, as the Pr.123K has relatively weak survivability and will be shredded in any brawls. Thus, you have to play very carefully, and always stay at speed, or you will get picked off very quickly by gun boats with large guns. You should be the person to capture points for your team, and stay a nuisance for the enemies.

Against smaller vessels such as MTBs, the two 14.5 mm machine guns are usually more than enough. However, note that these guns will bob considerably when travelling at high speeds, making aiming extremely difficult. Thus, ambush tactics are important - the boat who shoots first will almost always win the engagement. You should try to ambush other MTBs who are already distracted in order to maximise your ship's survivability. Against larger destroyers, the Pr.123 gets two large torpedoes which are often enough to knock out anything up to the size of a destroyer - make use of these torpedoes to get rid of larger vessels such as early destroyers.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely mobile with a high top speed and snappy control response
** Very small silhouette makes this boat extremely difficult to engage at range
* Two heavy-hitting machine guns capable of shredding through most boats at its BR
* Gets access to torpedoes which can easily destroy anything up to the size of a destroyer

'''Cons:'''

* Absolutely no armour and just 7 crew members cause the ship to have terrible survivability
** The hull is made of wood and can easily be set alight by machine-gun fire
* Two fewer guns than the preceding Pr.123bis
* Inability to engage opponents right in-front due to the positioning of the dual machine-gun turret
* Only two torpedoes which fire forward, compared to four on many comparable MTBs
* Can't hit anything in wavy waters

Pr.123K "Komsomolets" was the last variant of the Pr.123 series of motor torpedo boats built by the Soviet navy during and shortly after the Second World War. The ship differed from previous Pr.123 versions due to the removal of one 12.7 mm DShK machine gun turret, the installation of a heavier 14.5 mm machine gun turret, and the installation of two Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF) and target search radars. As well, the ship carried a new design of smoke generator designed to operate for longer periods of time. In total, 205 boats were built from 1949 to 1951.

The Pr.123K was the final development of the Pr.123 class, and had improved armament and sensor equipment. Compared to the previous Pr.123bis, several changes were made to the basic ship design. The Pr.123K was built with a new, more spacious open bridge, which housed the steering and control equipment. As well, the Pr.123K lost the forward machine gun turret of the Pr.123bis, while the rear turret was upgraded to a dual KPV machine gun turret. The ship had less powerful engines compared to the Pr.123bis (200 fewer hp per engine), but was capable of a higher top speed thanks to a lighter and more hydrodynamic hull. Finally, the ship gained two new radars - the "Zarnitsa" air-search radar and the "Fakel-M" IFF device. Both were mounted on a dome behind the bridge.

In total, 205 Pr.123K boats were built between 1949 and 1951, several years after their earlier counterparts. Of these, some ships were delivered without the radar installation. Two ships were modified with single and dual hydrofoils (being the A-10 and A-11 models), which were capable of even higher speeds in tests. As well, over 100 Pr.123K MTBs were exported to Warsaw-pact countries. The ships had a long service life, some ships remaining in export service until 1990.
