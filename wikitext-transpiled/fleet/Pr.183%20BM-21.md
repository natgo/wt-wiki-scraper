== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO: P-6) was a non-standard Project 183 PT boat, exported to Egypt, which had its rear turret and torpedoes removed for the installation of a BM-21 MLRS - likely an improvised solution during the Six-Day War as a means to bombard Israeli forces from coastal waters. The major difference between the Pr.183 and the Pr.183 BM-21 is the BM-21 Grad 122 mm MLRS launcher on its aft platform in place of the turret; it also features a new radar, replacing the original dome-like one.

The Pr.183 BM-21 was introduced during [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season X, "Royal Guard"]]. Although the installation of the BM-21 MLRS costed the aft autocannon turret and torpedo tubes, thus halving its firepower against light vessels, it now comes with forty 122 mm rockets situated at the aft, allowing players to utilise this infamous 'Hailstone (Grad)' to bombard even destroyers with salvos. However, do remember to take cover from time to time to maximise the survival of this vessel.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Being one of the last PT boats built by the Soviet Union, the ship itself is rather unprotected: its hull is still made of wood, whereas only the 25 mm autocannon turret and superstructure are constructed with 4 mm hardened steel. Any projectile larger than rifle-calibre will have no problem penetrating the mere 4 mm of steel on the turret and command tower, let alone the hull itself, being only 10 mm of wood. A near-miss from higher calibre cannons can do serious damage to the ship itself.

=== Mobility ===

<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The ship is propelled by four M50-T diesel engines with 4 shafts, propelling the ship at up to 70 km/h (37.8 kt). This ensures the overall flexibility of the ship to retreat from a heated battlefield and navigate through complicated water channels.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|2M-3 (25 mm)}}

With the aft turret and torpedo tubes removed, the only main weapon onboard is the front 25 mm 2M-3 twin mount autocannon. While the ammo count and the penetration of the cannon is more than enough to tear down small vessels, this is the only primary armament: keep the turret in operation at all costs to maximise its efficiency.

=== Special armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Special}}
<!-- ''Mortars, rocket launchers and missiles are also effective in skilled hands and can take an off-guard opponent by surprise. Evaluate the ammunition of this type of armament and rate its performance in combat. If there are no special armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|BM-21}}

The 122 mm BM-21 rockets, commonly known as "Grad" (Hailstone), are installed as an MLRS. The launcher itself can traverse 360° thanks to its clearance to the superstructure. While the original intention of the MLRS on an attack boat was purely for coastal bombardments against enemy ground targets, if enemy boats or auxiliary ships such as minelayers or destroyer escorts are within its range, all the 40 rockets onboard with almost 10 kg TNT equivalent of explosive contents will certainly give them a bad day, either from being detonated on impact or critically damaged by the salvo.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

A common characteristic of PT boats is their rather unprotected hull and superstructure, this being especially true for the Pr.183 due to its size and weight. The ship has only 10 mm of wood for its hull and 4 mm steel for the turret and command tower; anything larger than .30 calibre has a very high chance of penetrating the ship itself, let alone direct hits from cannons. Staying away from the battlefield is therefore extremely crucial for its survival. This limitation is also exacerbated by the relatively small crew pool of only 16 members; even if the ship might remain afloat after a hit, the crews will be quickly depleted.

The Egyptian Navy removed the aft twin 25mm autocannon turret and torpedo tubes on board, installing a BM-21 MLRS instead. The projectiles themselves - 122 mm rockets with 10 kg of TNT - will be a nightmare for light vessels, as it will likely mean a knock-out for them. Even larger ships up to destroyers could fall victim to it, given its 40-shot salvo and potential to trigger extensive damage to exposed components or over-pressurize turrets, disabling the ship or sinking it outright. Although the Pr.183 has one less autocannon turret than its base model, the remaining 2M-3 twin mount 25 mm autocannon still has rather high penetration for its calibre and can deliver 120 shots per magazine; this makes it capable of causing havoc to ships that show their sides or have rear-mounted weaponry. To maximise the efficiency of the ship, it is suggested to play it as a "guerrilla-on-water", using its reasonable mobility to manoeuvre around inland channels where it can take cover behind terrain and then strike out for a sudden attack on enemy ships; alternatively taking cover and utilising the rockets to take down unnoticed enemies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely lethal twin 25 mm turret with high ammo count and devastating firepower
* Small and nimble for navigating through inland channels
* 40 rocket salvos with high explosive content, extremely lethal to smaller vessels

'''Cons:'''

* Equipped with only one turret and its rocket launchers
* Extremely fragile to gunfire
* The size of the rocket launcher could trigger a detonation and lead to complete loss
* Relative small crew pool for replacement

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

As one of the last PT boat classes built by the Soviet Union, the Project 183 ''Bolshevik'' class PT boat was a major export vessel to allied countries, including the PLAN (which later built them domestically as the Type 6602 under the June 4th Agreement), KPAN, and notably, the Egyptian Navy.

During Nasser's presidency, the country had a good relationship with the Soviet Union, which provided a significant amount of aid and military equipment, ranging from assault rifles to jet fighters. The Project 183 was also among the sales made to Egypt, with 46 boats delivered to their navy. Although already obsolete by the late 1960s, leading to some losses against Israel; in July 1967, two were sunk by ''Eilat''. However, the Egyptian Navy gained revenge on 21st October 1967 by sinking ''Eilat'' and claiming the first anti-ship missile kill in history using a heavily-modified Project 183R with P-15 missiles.<ref>https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1986/march/missile-boat-warfare-israeli-style</ref>

While the Egyptian Navy maintained a relatively large fleet of Project 183s, 12 boats were modified to carry BM-21 Grad MLRS at the cost of some onboard armaments; these ships would have likely been decommissioned by the late 20th century and very few images remain as proof of their existence.
