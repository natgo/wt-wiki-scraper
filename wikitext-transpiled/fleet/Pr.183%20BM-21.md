== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season X, "Royal Guard"]].

The Pr.183 BM-21 is a non-standard Project 183 PT boat (AKA P-6 in NATO code) exported to Egypt with its rear-turret and torpedoes removed for the installation of a BM-21 MLRS. The major difference between the Pr.183 and the Pr.183 BM-21 is the BM-21 Grad 122 mm MLRS launcher on the aft platform in place of the turret; as well as a new radar replacing the original, dome-like one. The 40 rockets onboard will make sure light vessels will meet a swift end from the bombardment of 122 mm rockets from distance.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Being one of the last PT boats built by Soviet Union, the ship itself is rather unprotected where the hull is still made of wood, only the 25 mm autocannon turret and the superstructure are made with 4 mm hardened steel. Any projectile larger than rifle-calibre will have no problem penetrating the mere 4 mm of steel on the turret and command tower, let alone the hull itself with only 10 mm. A near-miss from higher calibre cannons can do serious damage to the ship itself.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The ship is propelled by four M50-T diesel engines with 4 shafts, propelling the ship at up to 70 km/h (37.8 kt). This ensures the overall flexibility of the ship to retreat from heated battlefield or navigating through complicated channels of water.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|2M-3 (25 mm)}}

With the aft turret and torpedo tubes removed, the only main weapon onboard is the front 25 mm 2M-3 twin mount autocannon. While the ammo count and the penetration of the cannon is more than enough to tear down small vessels, this is the only primary armament: keep the turret in operation at all cost to maximum its efficiency.

=== Special armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Special}}
<!-- ''Mortars, rocket launchers and missiles are also effective in skilled hands and can take an off-guard opponent by surprise. Evaluate the ammunition of this type of armament and rate its performance in combat. If there are no special armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|BM-21}}

The 122 mm BM-21 rockets, commonly known as "Grad" (Hailstone), are installed as a MLRS. The launcher itself could traverse 360° thanks to its clearance to the superstructure. While the original intention of MLRS on an attack boat is purely for coastal bombardments against enemy ground targets, if enemy boats or auxiliary ships i.e minelayers or destroyer escorts are within its range, all the 40 rockets onboard with almost 10 kg TNT equivalent of explosive contents will certainly give them a bad day, either from being detonated on impact or critically damaged by the salvo.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
	
A common characteristic of PT boats is their rather unprotected hull and superstructure, this is especially true for Pr.183 due to the size and weight limits for PT boats. The ship only has 10 mm of wood for the hull and 4 mm steel for turret and command tower, anything larger than .30 calibre has very high odds to penetrate the ship itself, let alone direct hits from cannons. So staying away from heated battlefield is extremely crucial for its survival. This also being limited by the rather small crew pool at only 16 crews onboard; chances are the ship might still be afloat but the crews will be knocked-out instead.

The Egyptian Navy removed the aft twin 25 mm autocannon turret and torpedo tubes onboard, and installed a BM-21 MLRS instead. The weapon itself, a single 122 mm rocket projectile with 10 kg of TNTe, is certainly a nightmare for light ships as this will likely mean a knock-out for them, larger ships up to destroyers could even fall victim of it as it has a 40-shot salvo and this could trigger extensive damage to either exposed components or overpressurizing turrets, disabling the ship or even sinking them straight. Although having one less autocannon turret from its base model, the remaining 2M-3 twin mount 25 mm autocannon has rather high penetration for its calibre and 120 shots per magazine can also make sure it can cause havoc to unnoticed ships that showed their sides or ships with rear-mounted weaponry. To make sure the maximum efficiency of the ship, it is suggested to play it as a "guerrilla-on-water" where players can utilize its sufficient mobility to manoeuvre around inland channels where it can take cover behind terrain, then strike out for a sudden attack for enemy ships; alternatively taking cover and use the rockets for taking down unnoticed enemies. Making it a small yet formidable enemy to be dealt with.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Extremely lethal twin 25 mm turret with high ammo count and devastating firepower
* Small and nimble for navigating through inland channels
* 40 rocket salvos with high explosive content, extremely lethal to smaller vessels

'''Cons:'''

* Equipped with only one turret and its rocket launchers
* Extremely fragile to gunfire
* The size of the rocket launcher could trigger a detonation and lead to complete loss
* Relative small crew pool for replacement


== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

As one of the last PT boat classes built by Soviet Union, the Project 183 ''Bolshevik'' Class PT Boat has been one of the major export vessel of the Union to allied countries including PLAN (which they later built domestically as the Type 6602 under the June 4th Agreement), KPAN and notably, Egyptian Navy.

During the Nasser presidency, the country had a good relationship with the Soviet Union with the latter providing a large amount of aid and military equipment ranging from assault rifles up to jet fighters. The abundant Project 183 was also among one of the sales to Egypt with around 46 of them delivered to their navy. Although being already obsolete in the late 1960s which led to some losses against Israel (2 by ''Eilat,'' on July 1967), the Egypt Navy got revenge by sinking ''Eilat'' on 21st, October 1967 and claiming the very first AShM kill in war history using the heavily-modified Project 183R with P-15 missiles.<ref>https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1986/march/missile-boat-warfare-israeli-style</ref>

While the Egyptian Navy maintained a fairly large fleet of Project 183s, 12 boats were then modified to carry BM-21 Grad MLRS at the cost of some onboard armaments; these ships would have likely been decommissioned by late 20th Century and very few images are left as proof of their existence.
