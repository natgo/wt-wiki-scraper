== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a Soviet Motor Torpedo Boat designed and built after WW2. This MTB was intended to replace the [[Pr.123K|Pr.123 MTB]], which served as the main MTB for the Soviet Navy since WW2. The chief designer drew inspiration from American-built Motor Torpedo Boats received through the Lend-Lease program. In 1952, mass production of Pr.183 began. There were also some modifications for this MTB, such as the Missile boat variant equipped with anti-ship missiles and the Gun boat variant equipped with MRLS.

This boat was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game. With a maximum speed of 81 km/h, it can be used to capture strategic points quickly and flank the enemy when possible. The boat is equipped with two [[2M-3 (25 mm)]] guns, effective against lightly armoured targets and PT boats, and can also serve as anti-aircraft defense. Additionally, it carries two [[53-38 (533 mm)]] torpedoes, which, while slow, compensate with extended range and a substantial explosive payload. Furthermore, it features 12 [[BB-1 depth charge|BB-1 depth charges]], effective for destroying enemy ships and boats when used properly.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Pr.183 hull is entirely constructed from wood. Only its superstructure and both turrets are protected by steel plates. It cannot withstand any fire; even 7.7 mm rounds can penetrate its hull at close range. With a crew of only 14 people, it lacks significant survivability since anything can penetrate its hull to begin with.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Similar to other MTBs, the Pr.183 is also highly agile. Powered by four M-50 diesel engines, it can reach speeds of 81 km/h forward and 33 km/h in reverse (RB/SB). This allows you to take circuitous routes to catch enemy boats and ships by surprise. In times of danger, you can swiftly retreat from the frontline and relocate to a safer position or reposition yourself for your next attack.

Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|2M-3 (25 mm)}}

The 25 mm 2M-3 is a frequently used naval autocannon among Soviet naval ships. It is effective against lightly armoured targets and PT boats, and can also serve as anti-aircraft defense. It only takes a few well-placed hits against enemy boats to incapacitate them. However, it's important to note that aiming can be challenging due to the motion of the waves and the presence of torpedo tubes, which might cause your shots to be less accurate.

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-38 (533 mm)|BB-1 depth charge}}

The 533 mm 53-38 Torpedo is relatively slow and heavy in comparison to torpedoes used by other nations' MTBs. However, it compensates with extended range and a substantial explosive payload. Effectively employing this torpedo requires getting in very close proximity (approximately 1.5 km) to the enemy ship due to its slower speed.

The BB-1 depth charge is primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare. However, since there is no submarines, it can be repurposed for ship hunting by discreetly approaching enemy vessels and deploying it nearby. Additionally, it can serve in engagements with other boats; releasing the depth charges when pursued from behind can effectively deter chasing enemy boats.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Pr.183 can fulfill roles as a brawler or a flanker, depending on the player's preference. It can engage both boats and ships effectively when utilized correctly.

'''Usage against boats:'''

The Pr.183 boasts impressive speed, allowing you to flank and catch enemy boats off guard using its 25 mm 2M-3 autocannons. Alternatively, you can capitalize on your speed to secure strategic points swiftly. The boat excels at incapacitating enemy vessels with well-placed shots. While you might encounter challenges against armoured boats, utilizing AP magazines can help overcome them. It's important to note that your wooden hull offers limited protection, making you susceptible to incoming fire. Prioritize target selection and cautious engagement due to your boat's low survivability. It's advisable not to expect prolonged survival in battles, given the vulnerability of the Pr.183.

'''Usage against ships:'''

The Pr.183 is equipped with 2 torpedoes and 12 depth charges in its arsenal. A precisely aimed torpedo can effectively sink an enemy destroyer or even some light cruisers with just one hit. Alternatively, you can utilize the depth charges to achieve the same goal. However, exercise caution, as dropping them near the enemy ship is crucial for causing damage. Employ a flanking strategy by concealing yourself behind large boulders or small islands and patiently await the passage of the enemy ship. Once they have passed, tail them closely and attempt to approach. Remaining unnoticed, you can position yourself beside the enemy ship and release 4-6 depth charges, usually sufficient to sink the target. In the event the enemy ship detects you, fire your torpedo in their path and swiftly retreat to cover.

In the early 1950s, the Soviet Navy recognized the need for a new Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) to replace its existing Pr.123 MTB. This new vessel had to possess enhanced firepower while retaining the agility of its predecessor. The chief designer drew upon the knowledge gained from operating American-built Vosper, Elco, and Higgins Torpedo Boats received through the Lend-Lease program. This novel MTB was named the Pr.183 Bolshevik (also known as the P 6-class torpedo boat in NATO classification). It featured significantly greater firepower compared to its precursor, attributable to the inclusion of two 25 mm 2M-3 turrets. Despite striving to maintain the agility of its predecessor, certain design compromises, such as employing plywood for the hull, were made to achieve the desired speed.

The production of the Pr.183 Bolshevik started in 1952. The USSR carried out numerous developmental upgrades for the Pr.183. For instance, an improved version of the Pr.183 was equipped with an additional gas turbine engine, and a remote radio-controlled variant of the Pr.183 was developed for target practice. In 1954, the People's Liberation Army Navy (the Chinese Navy) reached an agreement with the USSR to license the production of the Pr.183, naming it the Type 02 torpedo boat. This marked the Chinese Navy's introduction to torpedo boats.

The Pr.183 Bolshevik found service in numerous nations. Prominent among these were the Soviet Navy, the Volksmarine, the People's Liberation Army Navy, and the Egyptian Navy. In particular, the Egyptian Navy acquired the [[Pr.183 BM-21]] Motor Gun Boat variant. In contrast to the standard configuration featuring two torpedo launchers and two 25 mm 2M-3 turrets, the Pr.183 BM-21 was outfitted with a single 25 mm 2M-3 turret and a 122 mm BM-21 Rocket Launcher.
