== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet armoured gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
As an "armoured gun boat", the Pr.191 has layers of armour around the hull and bridge to help against small-arms fire from the opposition. Almost all the armour on the boat are of the RHA composition, and so their stated thickness are their actual protection values provided for the ship.

The armour covers the bridge and turrets in all angles. However, despite all this armour in the fuselage enveloping the ship's centre and the rear turret's ammo stowage, it does not cover the bow ammo rack carrying the 85 mm rounds for the main armament; nor does it cover the rear fuel tanks, steering gear, and transmission. Because of this, glancing shots towards the bow and stern of the boat may put the ship into a perilous situation.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Hardened armour (Rear and top 12.7 mm DShK turrets)

'''Notes:'''

* Turret base have an armour thickness of 10 mm. While the bow 85 mm turret base is made of RHA, the stern turret base is made of hardened armour.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

In general, the Pr. 191 has pretty bad mobility. The ship has a max speed of 29 km/h spaded in RB, which is slow even for Soviet armoured gun boats. As well, the ship isn't too responsive and doesn't have a great turning circle. All in all, the ship should not rely on its mobility due to its poor turn and speed capabilities.

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|MIRAB mine}}

This ship comes with 10 MIRAB mines. They are rather small, and should be used only against corvette and smaller sized ships. Several hits may sink a destroyer from flooding. The best use for these mines is to lay them at a capture point and hope that an enemy ship runs over the mine and gets blown up; however, it may be the best option to simply not carry them at all, as they do pose a risk of detonating when hit.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Pr. 191 is quite an interesting ship to play, due to its unique set of characteristics - heavy armament, good armour, and bad manoeuvrability. This ship excels at longer range combat, making full use of its super-heavy main armament.

'''Tactics:'''

The Pr. 191 can work very well in certain situations, particularly longer-range engagements. This is because of its great weapons load, namely the 85 mm cannon mounted in front of the bridge. Assuming that you have decent accuracy, you can easily sink enemy vessels with a few hits. The Pr. 191 also carries two dual 12.7 mm DShK machine gun turrets, which provide a surprisingly good measure of anti-aircraft and anti-MTB defence. Note that the anti-aircraft armament is otherwise bare, meaning that the ship is very poorly defended from aerial threats at longer ranges, where the DShKs are less effective.

The Pr. 191 is rather lacking in survivability compared to some of its peers. The ship has a crew of 14 sailors, which isn't particularly impressive for a Soviet armoured gun boat. As well, the Pr. 191 lacks heavy armour, with 30 mm protecting the turret and just 7 mm of hull armour. This means that the ship can, and will, be shredded by any enemy cannon fire. As a result, captains should make use of island cover to maximise survivability. One additional good strategy is to stay bow-in on the enemy at longer ranges. This prevents enemies from hitting all three of the ship's sections at once, which greatly reduces the risk of being shredded.

Finally, the Pr. 191 suffers from a rather mediocre manoeuvrability, with a poor turning circle and a rather disappointing top speed of 29 km/h in RB. Thus, the ship cannot be relied upon to capture zones, as it will take ages just to get to the capture point. In general, this ship should be played as a longer-range sniper, maximising the use of its powerful armament.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Possesses a powerful 85 mm cannon to pick off targets quickly
* Decent secondary armament of four (2 x 2) 12.7 mm DShK machine guns in dual mounts
* Relatively thin profile, presents a rather small target when facing an enemy head-on
* Can carry naval mines, which could be potentially deadly towards heavier enemies

'''Cons:'''

* Only one main gun which can only fire towards the front and sides - leaves a blind spot in the rear
* Front ammo rack, rear mobility modules, and fuel tanks are not armoured at all
** 7 mm hull armour is not enough to protect the ship from cannon fire
** Small crew complement of 14 crew members, very low among the Soviet armoured gun boats
* 12.7 mm guns drop off in effectiveness rapidly with range, limiting their usefulness as anti-aircraft weapons
* Shallow draught causes the boat to constantly rock in sea conditions, hampering accuracy

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Following the Soviet's experience with the [[Pr.1124 (1945)|Pr.1124]] and 1125 armoured boats, development for an improved successor came in the immediate post-war period of 1946, assigned to Central Design Bureau №19 (TsKB-19) at Leningrad. The improvements were for more armour, an 85 mm gun, two 12.7 mm machine guns and powered by the T-34 V-12 diesel engine.<ref name="Navpedia_191M" /> The boat developed as the '''Project 191''' in Shipyard №344 at the city of Molotov (today known as Perm).<ref name="Navpedia_191" /><ref name="RusShip_191" />

The single unit produced was designated '''BK-166'''.<ref name="Navpedia_191" /><ref name="RusShip_191" /> From the ship's development, improvements were made with M-50 diesel engines and 14.5 mm machine guns that would be used in succeeding units as the ''[[Pr.191M|Project 191M]]'',<ref name="Navpedia_191M" /> of which 118 units would be produced.<ref name="RusShip_191" />
