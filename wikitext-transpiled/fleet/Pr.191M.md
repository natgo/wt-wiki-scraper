== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet armoured gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] when the Soviet fleet was implemented into the game.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Positive aspects:

* The hull is made of 6 mm steel, this can stop some small calibre HE rounds and the occasional shrapnel.
* The armoured sections were designed to withstand rifle-calibres, and will not protect you against 20 mm AP and larger rounds.

Negative aspects:

* Armour doesn't cover 100% of any compartments, meaning any HE that pierces more than 5 mm can destroy any compartments except the superstructure
* Low crew of 14
* 85 mm ammo isn't protected by any armour plates

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|85 mm/54.6 ZIS-C-53 (85 mm)}}

The 85 mm/54.6 ZIS-C-53 gun is one of the best guns you will ever find at this battle rating. This gun's HE is able to penetrate most if not all ships it faces, but it is recommended to keep a few APHE just in case.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|KPV (14.5 mm)}}

Secondary armament consists of 2 turrets equipped with dual 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine guns. The KPVT was designed to destroy light vehicles, and can penetrate up to 40 mm of RHA close up. This is not to be ignored, the round will go through the aircraft's armour and engines like butter, wrecking anything in its way. This also means the KPVT can deal significant damage to other PT boats.

As AA guns, these will do well at close ranges up to 2,000 m. They will have difficulty against anything further away, and aren't well suited to attacking medium and large bombers.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|MIRAB mine}}

The ship comes with 12 MIRAB mines. These mines are rather small, and should be used mostly against corvettes and smaller vessel. A destroyer will survive a hit without issue, and anything hitting a torpedo bulge won't deal any damage. These are best used in small capture points against other PT boats.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 85 mm main gun will be useful against all types of targets up to destroyer size while 14.5 mm KPVT gun will help against close aircraft and PT boats
* Armour can withstand up to 12.7 mm rounds, this will stop shrapnel and many aircraft guns

'''Cons:'''

* Low crew of 14, the compartment aren't fully covered in armour, meaning some HE salvoes may knock you out instantly
* Low speed of barely over 30 km/h, making you a great target for canons
* Lacks any decent medium/long range AA
* Shallow draught causes the boat to constantly rock in sea conditions, hampering accuracy

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
