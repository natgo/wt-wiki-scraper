== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
French light cruiser '''Primauguet''' was commissioned in April 1927 as the third vessel of the [[Duguay-Trouin (Family)|Duguay-Trouin class]] and spent her early career on long voyages between French colonial possessions. As WW2 arrived, she was moved to patrolling the Atlantic Ocean, and later re-based to the Caribbean. After the French surrender in 1940, she operated in the Vichy French Navy against the Free French, until being sent for a refit in Casablanca. When the US attacked the port, Primauguet sortied with the Vichy destroyers against the battleship USS Massachusetts and supporting forces. Despite her refit not being completed and enemy having a huge advantage in firepower, she engaged enemy vessels with all her guns, until being heavily damaged and forced into beaching to avoid sinking. She burned out and was struck off as a total loss.

Introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]] along with the first release of the researchable French tech tree, she is a capable but poorly armoured light cruiser. Her main upsides are the sustained damage output and excellent torpedoes, while her downsides include the lacking protection and anti-air armament. She's best used against enemy destroyers and some of the light cruisers, while she will suffer greatly if forced to duel with enemy heavy cruisers or battleships. She also should avoid coastal vessels, as her large size and lacking support weapons will make her a relatively easy target to the motor torpedo boats. The namesake of her class is available as a premium vessel - [[Duguay-Trouin]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The ship has a significant advantage in terms of survivability due to the size of its crew, with 578 sailors it is one of the largest at the BR. The ammunition racks are located deep below the waterline and are protected by additional plating, which makes ammunition explosions very unlikely to occur. Moreover, the turrets and ammo elevators are equipped with 30 mm armour, which can reduce fragmentation damage caused by near-misses.

The ship's large size also serves as a form of protection as its hull is divided into 9 sections, a feature typically found on heavy cruisers, reducing damage from both torpedoes and bombs.

However, like other ships in its BR, the Primauguet does not have armour that can directly stop high-calibre SAP or HE shells. Typically for light cruisers it is also unable to withstand damage from multiple enemy warships.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The mobility can be described in one word: average. The rudder turn speed varies between 5.4 seconds (not upgraded) to 4.05 seconds (aced crew with maximum leadership), which is somewhat slower than most of the light cruisers of the BR when not upgraded, but the same as all the competitors when fully aced. Guns can easily keep up with the turn rate thanks to their high horizontal targeting speed.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells.

{{main|155 mm/50 model 1920 (155 mm)}}

Four twin turrets provide one of the highest damage outputs in the BR, comparable only with some of the US destroyers. While the low rate of fire can be an issue under some circumstances, the size of the explosive filler in both HE and SAP shells more than make up for it. The gun comes equipped with three types of shells:

* '''M1924 HE''' - large explosive filler, contact fuse, best against soft-skinned targets and external modules on the enemy warships
* '''M1924 SAP''' - good explosive filler, best against lightly-armoured targets, will dive into the ship to reach the internal modules
* '''M1924 HE-BF''' - smallest explosive filler of the three, base fuse, particularly good when hitting a highly angled target, will dive deeper into the ship bellows than SAP, but also is more prone to over-penetration and has less of a penetrative capability against a parallel target

The ship lacks any dedicated anti-air shells or AP shells that could penetrate heavy armour.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|75 mm/50 model 1922 (75 mm)}}

Having just two 75 mm secondary guns per side, equipped with an HE shells with contact fuse, secondary armament shouldn't be relied upon. They reload every 4 seconds, which is insufficient for easy dealing with manoeuvring torpedo boats.

Mounts have an ability to engage targets up to 85° vertical guidance, which would make them perfect against high altitude bombers, but this is severely limited by the lack of {{Annotation|HE-TF|High-explosive with time fuse}} or {{Annotation|HE-VT|High-explosive variable time fuse}} shells. In effect, the gunfire has primarily a psychological effect against enemy aircraft, as the probability of directly hitting at ranges where 75 mm would provide an additional protection is negligible.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Model 1929 Hotchkiss (13.2 mm)}}

The armament of six twin 13.2 mm is rather underwhelming, only able to automatically intercept targets within 2 km range, and lacking the stopping power that widely-used 20 mm guns have. They are sub-par in their performance against aircraft and coastal vessels alike.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Model 1923DT (550 mm)}}

Divided between two triple-launchers on each side, there are six torpedoes boasting an impressively wide firing angle (over 110°). This excellent firing angle, significantly enhances their role as a surprise weapon. This is further enhanced by the fact that each of the launchers carries a full reload, for a total of 24 torpedoes onboard. The torpedoes themselves offer a great combination of speed and range, complemented by a substantial warhead. As a result, they prove effective for both short-range engagements and long-range area denial.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located aft is a catapult with one '''Gourdou-Leseurre GL.832HY''' scout plane which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The GL.832HY is a mid-1930s design so was a simple 2-seater with a single defensive machine gun turret and no bombs. It does have the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilise the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example, to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new!

'''Note:''' Because the catapult is directly behind the rear turret the aircraft would block the guns, it will not be visible until you launch it.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Primauguet is a very effective cruiser in its BR and lower, but has little means of responding against heavy cruisers from higher BRs. It's a gun-centric ship that can output a significant amount of damage even with the HE shells, but where it shines is the damage output from SAP shells compared to similar shells from other vessels.

The ship is best used for pushing enemy points, out-ranging enemy destroyers and picking off problematic, but lightly-armoured, targets. What it should avoid are direct exchanges of fire with the enemy heavy cruisers, unless they can be caught within torpedo spread, as well as enemy coastal vessels - in particular motor torpedo boats.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very good damage output from the main guns
* Good survivability with very well protected ammo racks
* Very good torpedoes

'''Cons:'''

* Very limited armour protection
* Very limited capability to deal with a heavily-armoured target due to the lack of AP shells
* Lack of {{Annotation|HE-TF|High-explosive with time fuse}} or {{Annotation|HE-VT|High-explosive variable time fuse}} shells
* Ineffective anti-air cover
