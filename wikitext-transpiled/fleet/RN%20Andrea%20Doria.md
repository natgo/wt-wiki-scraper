<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian battleship {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
[[File:RN Andrea Doria Armor.jpg|thumb|Overview of the protection scheme]]
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
All battleships in this BR range have a relatively comparable armor. Differences rarely if every exceed 20%, and typically are below 10%. That said, Andrea Doria features below-average armor, while having one of the largest crew compliments.

Similarly to other battleships from World War 1, it has a number of crewmen exposed on an external gun mounts, making it easy for any ship armed with HE shells to kill a number of crewmen. Repairing these mounts will crew them back again, making it easy to lose the ship when under a constant HE fire. In order to prevent this, avoid repairing the ship until any of the vital components are damaged.

Shell rooms and auxiliary ammunition storage are protected deep below the waterline and/or multiple components, making it very difficult to destroy, even with a diving shells.

Ship lacks dedicated torpedo defence, but the coal bunkers along with heavy armor will reduce the impact of the hits from the torpedoes with smaller warheads (in particular: aerial torpedoes). Still, a care should be taken to avoid the hits if possible.

=== Devblog History ===
While Italy was ramping up its construction of dreadnought battleships in the early 1910s, the decision was made to construct another two battleships in order to meet its naval rearmament goals. As ships of the Conte di Cavour class were already under construction at the time, shipbuilders decided to base the new class off the design of the former, while only applying some minor changes. This design was completed within six months and construction was ordered in September 1911.

Andrea Doria was laid down in March of 1912 in the Spezia dockyards and was subsequently launched the following year. However, it wouldn't be until 1916 before the warship was considered complete. This was due to numerous delays in the fitting out period, primarily due to difficulties in the supply of the ship's primary battery guns which caused significant delays. Nonetheless, the ship did see completion and officially joined the ranks of the Regia Marina in August 1916.

Despite entering service in the middle of WWI, Andrea Doria didn't see much combat action as the primary adversary - the Austro-Hungarian navy - operated in the Adriatic. However, as the Italian navy deemed the danger of submarines and minelayers for capital ships to be too great in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, most ended up not being deployed for extensive combat operations in that particular theater.

As a result, Andrea Doria survived The Great War without great incident and continued its service into the postwar period. In this time, it helped suppress a rebellion in Fiume and undertook several diplomatic missions to a number of ports in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. In August 1932 however, Andrea Doria was withdrawn from active service and placed in reserve. Starting in 1937 and going into 1940, Andrea Doria underwent a full reconstruction, which drastically changed the warship's visual appearance and combat capabilities.
