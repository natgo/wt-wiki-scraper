== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
RN Aquila Set up as Vifor on 11 March 1914 for the Romanian Navy, after the outbreak of WWI during May 1915 she was taken by Italy and launched on 26 July 1916 and handed over to the Italian Navy as explorer RN Aquila, Assigned to the 3°Gruppo Esploratori  of the 4th Division, reporting to the Superior Naval Command at Brindisi, the first action in which the RN Aquila took part was on 15 May 1917, together with other Italian and British units, in a battle against 3 Austrian Explorers of the Novara Class during which she was hit by a shell from the Csepel, rendering the RN Aquila immobilised, in the last months of WWI she was used as a support unit for the bombardment of Durazzo, after WWI the RN Aquila carried out a total of 42 War Missions for a total of 433 of motion, while she remained ready to move for 2030 hours, on 14 September 1922 she was taken to the Arsenal in Naples and later to the Castellammare di Stabia shipyards for work, on 11 October 1937 she was handed over to the Spanish Nationalist Navy, which named her Melilla, but all this was done in secret for political reasons.

'''RN Aquila''' introduced with the [[Update "Fire and Ice"|"Fire and Ice" Update]], is a particular destroyer that already can use AP projectiles and also has 152 guns at a very low level, the armament is quite good against other enemy destroyers instead for aerial targets this ship suffers due to the lack of anti-aircraft armament, the manoeuvrability and speed is decent, for survival however it is a little poor due to the little armour.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

* Adeguate manouvrability and speed
* Good secondary armament for enemy coastal boats

*
