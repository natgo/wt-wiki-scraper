RN Attilio Regolo was a light cruiser of the Capitani Romani class, laid down on September 28, 1939, and completed and commissioned on May 14, 1942. Attilio Regolo had no opportunity to participate in actual wartime missions, on November 7, 1942 she was hit by a torpedo launched from the submarine HMS Unruffled, whose torpedo striking destroyed almost the entire bow, and she only returned to activity on September 8, 1943 in Genoa. According to armistice provisions, on September 9 she arrived at the height of the Gulf of Asinara, and was sent to assist the shipwrecked battleship Roma. Attilio Regolo carried out a total of 3 missions covering 1,962 miles for 113 hours of motion during Co-Belligerent service. After the war, she was transferred to La Spezia where she remained inactive pending the execution of the naval clauses of the Peace Treaty. She was decommissioned on July 26, 1948 and ceded to France, renamed Chateaurenault, and remained in service until October 1, 1962.

The Attilio Regolo, introduced with the initial Italian naval tree in [[Update "Starfighters"]], is a cruiser with good firepower, mobility, and manoeuvrability characteristics. Its 135 mm guns are perfect for battering destroyers and light cruisers, however, for more armoured targets it has a much harder time causing serious damage. The anti-aircraft armament gives you good cover from air attacks, and its manoeuvrability and speed allow it to dodge enemy shells and torpedoes. However, its survivability is not the best, as it is very lightly armoured.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
[[File:RN Attilio Regolo Armor.jpg|thumb|Overview of the protection scheme]]
The Attilio Regolo's hull lacks any substantial armour, with the design emphasizing speed instead. This leaves areas such as the engines, ammunition magazines, and the bridge susceptible to damage from even destroyers' shells. However, the front of the turrets are protected by 20 mm of armour, while the sides and roof are protected by 6 mm of armour. This protects the turrets from nearby explosions from destroyers' high explosive rounds, but direct hits will disable the ship's armament. The bridge is also surrounded by 15 mm of armour, which is not reliable in protecting the module.

The greatest threats to the survivability of the ship are the exposed torpedo tubes and spare torpedoes amidships and the highly exposed ammunition magazine under the 'X' turret. The former can detonate when hit and quickly incapacitate the ship, removing the use of almost every module past the bridge. However, this can be avoided by either firing off the torpedoes as soon as possible or not bringing them at all. The ammunition magazine will also detonate when hit, which will immediately destroy the ship. It is not possible to empty or redistribute the ammunition held here, and thus the only protection is to avoid getting hit there at all.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

Thanks to its four Thornycroft boilers and four Parsons turbines which together deliver 110,000 hp, the Attilio Regolo can reach a top speed of 72 km/h forward and a maximum reverse speed of -25 km/h. With these powerful engines the acceleration is also very good: it can reach top speed in about 30 seconds. Unfortunately, due to its length it does not excel in manoeuvrability, completing a full circle in 1 minute 25 seconds.

{{main|135 mm/45 O.T.O. Mod. 1937 (135 mm)}}

The 8 x 135 mm/45 O.T.O Mod. 1937 are divided into 4 turrets allowing the ship to use at least half of its armament at any angle. The HE Dirompente is underwhelming with only 23 mm of penetration at any angle, and an explosive mass of 1.8 kg. This shell is unreliable and should be avoided after the APHEBC Perforante and the HE-TF Contro-aerea shells are unlocked. The APHEBC Perforante is the most reliable shell used on the Attilio Regolo with a penetration of 174 mm at 1,000 m, and an explosive mass of 1.47 kg. The HE-TF Contro-aerea shell shares almost all of its characteristics with the HE Dirompente, but has a time fuse added to it for use as an AA shell; with its versatility as an anti-air shell and as a normal HE shell, this is the second most reliable shell to have.

{{main|37 mm/54 Breda Mod.39 (37 mm)|20 mm/70 Scotti-Isotta Fraschini mod.1939 (20 mm)}}

For secondary armament the Attilio Regolo is armed with 8 x 37 mm/54 Breda Mod.39 autocannons, and 4 x 20 mm/70 Scotti-Isotta Fraschini Mod.1939 autocannons in double mounts. These secondary autocannons are effective as anti-air under control of the AI, but will need to be used by the player if they want to be used to destroy torpedo boats effectively.

<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo M (533 mm)|Bollo P.200/1936 mine}}

The 533 mm steam-turbined S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo M torpedoes have an explosive mass of 270 kg, and a range of 12 km at 74 km/h with torpedo mode enabled, while it goes 4 km at a speed of 93 km/h when the torpedo mode is disabled. The torpedoes are best used as a tool to force opponents to avoid areas such as channels. If the player does not use torpedoes often then it is recommended to not bring them as they can be destroyed as an external ammo rack causing catastrophic damage.

The general gameplay of the Attilio Regolo is most similar to a destroyer then a light cruiser. The lack of meaningful armour means that it is fairly weak in a head-on engagement, but they can easily be avoided thanks to its incredible top speed. The ship has two general playstyles that fit it well, the first being a light brawler fighting for caps, and the second being a flanking support ship. The main threats to the Attilio Regolo are heavier cruisers than itself, such as the [[Emden]] and [[USS Trenton]], as well as destroyers with higher rates of fire such as the [[USS Sumner]] or [[Tashkent]]. The best way to counter cruisers such as the Emden is by simply avoiding the conflict using the ships high speed and smoke, or by using the ship's decent torpedo loadout to destroy them when they are unaware of you. Destroyers can best be dealt with by using terrain to your advantage to protect yourself from incoming fire, and retaliate while in safety of islands. The most vulnerable spot of the Attilio Regolo is its extra torpedo storage in the middle of the ship, this can best be protected by keeping the bow of the ship centred on an enemy you are fighting. While being in a broadside allows the ship to bring more of its firepower to use, it also exposes the external torpedoes that can quickly be set off destroying the ship.

Basically, the RN Attilio Regolo is an excellent light support cruiser. It can provide an excellent anti-aircraft barrage with its effective 20 and 37 mm turrets. The Attilio Regolo can also provide support fire against small and medium-sized vessels making life easier for ships with longer reloading times. It is recommended to use this ship in the second and third line, supporting heavy cruisers and dreadnoughts, and even with good survivability the ship alone will not be as effective as when in a group.

During the 1930's, the Regia Marina was looking into building a type of 'ocean scout' vessel. Initially, the design work took inspiration from the Condottieri-class cruisers, but was soon abandoned in favor of a more compact and modern design. By the end of the decade however, the need for 'scout' vessels became somewhat redundant thanks to the advances in aviation and radar technology. As a result, the design was reclassified as a light cruiser and would serve as a flotilla leader.

Plans were made for the construction of 12 vessels of the 'Capitani Romani' class of light cruisers, all of which were laid down in various Italian shipyards in September and October of 1939. However, only three ships of the class would actually see completion while the others either had their construction cancelled or were later on captured in drydock by German forces.

One of the ships which did see completion is the Attilio Regolo, which entered service with the Regia Marina in May 1942. However, the ship's didn't see extensive service not only due to joining the war late, but also because it was hit by a torpedo from British submarine HMS Unruffled in November of the same year, getting severely crippled.

Postwar, Attilio Regolo was handed over to France in 1948 as war reparations and subsequently entered service with the French Navy as 'Châteaurenault'. The ship went on to serve with the French Navy until the early 1960's, before being decommissioned and sold for scrap in the 1970's.
