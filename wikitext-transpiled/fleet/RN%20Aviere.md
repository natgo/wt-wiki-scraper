== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''RN Aviere''' was one of the 19 [[Soldati (Family)|Soldati-class]] destroyers, built in an OTO Melara shipyard in Livorno between 1937 and 1938, entered service on 31 August 1938, and was assigned to the 11th destroyer squadron. In the pre-war period she performed training activities, and during the Second World War participated in several missions, most famously the Battle of Punta Stilo (1940), Battle of Sirte (1941-1942), and eventually the Battle of Mezzo Agosto, completing 145 missions in all her service and having a distance travelled of 58,000 miles (93,000 km). Eventually, on 17 December 1942, while escorting the RN Camicia Nera and the German ship Ankara north of Biserta, she was hit by torpedoes from the submarine HMS Splendid, causing her to sink rapidly.

Introduced in the [[wt:en/news/7267-event-summer-landing-en|2021 Summer Landing event]] during [[Update "Red Skies"]], '''{{Specs|1=name}}''' is a ship with excellent acceleration and manoeuvrability and therefore a good ability to dodge enemy hits and torpedoes. The armament is composed of four 120 mm and eight 20 mm cannons, a good armament but not excellent. It is not recommended to attempt breakthroughs because of the reload of the main guns. The strong point is the torpedoes that can easily demolish enemy ships.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
All the Soldati-class have the same armour; the only differences between them is the armament or crew.

The RN Aviere has no armour whatsoever other than 12 mm anti-fragmentation shields protecting the main gun mounts. These mounts are, however, open-backed, and can be disabled by nearby explosions if they land behind the gun shield. There are also some large fuel tanks providing some degree of protection to the transmission and the stern and amidships main gun magazines.

The RN Aviere has a massive unarmoured bridge that takes up almost the entirety of the forward superstructure, which makes her very vulnerable to getting the bridge disabled.

The RN Aviere has a crew of 187 men, compared to the other Soldati-class it has much less crew so it cannot sustain as much damage as RN Geniere and RN Corazziere which have crews of 215 men.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The RN Aviere is powered by 3 engines, which gives it a maximum speed of 70 km/h in RB and 86 km/h in AB, while the reverse speed is 29 km/h in RB and 35 km/h in AB.

In both AB and RB modes, the RN Aviere has a very good acceleration both forwards and backwards from a standstill, this gives you a better chance to dodge torpedoes or enemy salvoes.

In combat, in a sustained turn the speed remains at 49 km/h in RB and 52 km/h in AB.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|120 mm/50 O.T.O. Mod.1936 (120 mm)}}

The primary armament consists of 2 twin-barrelled cannons [[120 mm/50 O.T.O. Mod.1936 (120 mm)|120 mm/50 Mod.1936]], these guns can carry 3 different projectiles:

* HE has 1.63 kg of explosives and can cause serious damage if used on the top of enemy ships,
* HE-TF has 1.63 kg of explosive unlike HE projectiles these in particular has a time fuse that is automatically configured during target aiming and practically explode based on the time and distance of the perfect configuration against aerial targets,
* APHEBC has 1.3 kg of explosives and can cause serious internal damage to the enemy ship if they are used against ammoracks and engines.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)}}

The RN Aviere has four twin [[20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)|20/65 Breda Mod. 1935 cannon]], two on each side of the ship. These are decent at short and medium range anti-aircraft weapons.

Because of the railings surrounding these weapons, they cannot depress enough to engage surface targets closer than ~1.1 km and have a slow rate of fire, making them useless against coastal boat.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo I (533 mm)|B TG 100 depth charge}}

The additional armament consists of six 533 mm [[S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo I (533 mm)|S.I. 270/533.4X7.2 Tipo I]] torpedoes and two [[B TG 100 depth charge|B TG 100]] depth charges

The torpedoes are placed in the center of the ship can only be launched when pointing left or right, due to the torpedo mode modification the torpedo range can be increased but the speed is reduced.

Depth charges, on the other hand, are placed in launchers one on the left and one on the right, you have to use them in a certain way because they are not dropped into the water but are launched for a few tens of meters.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
RN Aviere compared to RN Geniere and RN Corazziere has less main armament and less crew.

Instead of having 5 x 120 mm cannons it only has 4 which allow it to damage or destroy other destroyers with one shot, APHE are perfect against destroyers and light cruisers while the heavy ones need enough shots to do serious damage to them, HE are perfect against small targets or firing on the decks of enemy ships so you can disable the ship's control, while torpedoes are the ship's main piece of equipment and cause serious damage to enemy ships or complete destruction.

Reduced crew is a disadvantage for RN Aviere, which means you cannot be in prolonged combat against other ships.

In Battle RN Aviere must be used with cover (an island, rock, etc.), thanks to your acceleration you can get out of cover and fire a few shots then return behind cover so you avoid enemy damage, if you find open maps without cover you will be an easy target so move away and fire at a distance dodging incoming enemy shots.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Incredible acceleration
* Incredible manoeuvrability
* Fairly large AP shell filler with good penetration
* Fast main gun traverse and elevation speeds
* Wide main gun traverse arcs

'''Cons:'''

* Huge unarmoured bridge
* Small HE shell filler
* Low main gun rate of fire
* Inadequate anti-aircraft defences (slow AA rate of fire)
* Torpedoes have a very short range without the torpedo mode installed
* Reduced crew compared to other Soldati-class ships

In 1941 RN Aviere participated in the 1st Battle of Sirte.

In 1942 joined the 1st Squadra Navale; participated in the 2nd Battle of Sirte, then in the same year did several escort missions and later participated in the Battle of "Mezzo Agosto".

=== Sinking ===
On 17 December 1942, north of Biserta, while on an escort mission with the RN Camicia Nera and the German ship Ankara, was hit by two torpedoes from an enemy submarine HMS Splendid, causing the rapid sinking of the ship.

The Memorial of Commander C.V. Ignazio Castrogiovanni, who died at sea, was awarded the Gold Medal for Military Valour (Medaglia d'oro al valor militare).

===[[wt:en/news/7260-development-summer-marathon-vehicles-rn-aviere-en|Devblog]]===
In 1936, the Royal Italian Navy initialized development of a new class of destroyers, based on the previous Oriani class designs. New ships were supposed to install improved main battery guns and a reinforced anti-aircraft gun battery. Soldati class destroyers were produced in two large batches (series). One of the ships of the first production series was the destroyer Aviere (Italian "pilot"), which was completed in 1937 and became part of the 11th destroyer battalion. She received her baptism of fire in the Battle of Calabria, where she made a torpedo attack against the British fleet. In the battle at Cape Passero in October 1940, she attacked the cruiser HMS Ajax, she received serious damage from the enemy fire and went to the port of Augusta for repairs. After repair was completed, she continued combat service in the Mediterranean. In December 1942, during an escort mission en route from Naples to Bizerte, she was attacked by a British submarine P-228. The destroyer was hit by two torpedoes, followed by the detonation of the ammo stowages, after which she sank. Of the 230 crew members, only 30 were saved.
