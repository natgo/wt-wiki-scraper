== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]].

Historically Bartolomeo Colleoni was the third ship of the [[Condottieri-class]], she was laid down in June 1928 and commissioned in February 1932. Compared to the later {{Specs-Link|it_cruiser_montecuccoli}} (laid down in October 1931) it had a significantly worse protection, completely lacking any armour around barbettes and having a weaker citadel armour. It was originally designed as a direct counter to the French large destroyers, thus speed was of a much more value than the armour.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
[[File:RN Bartolomeo Colleoni Armor.jpg|thumb|Overview of the protection scheme]]
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Bartolomeo Colleoni suffers from having comparatively poor armour protection and low crew count, at the same BR it is only better than its Japanese and US equivalents in this regard.

The protection of the [[ammo racks]] on this ship is somewhat better at the rear, where the magazines and shell rooms are situated below or between them and under the waterline. However, the racks on the front of the ship are partially exposed above the waterline, including one of the highly explosive shell rooms. Racks are equipped with double plate armour, consisting of 18 mm exterior armour and 20 mm interior armour, with gaps. The bow, stern, and deck are each protected by a single 20 mm plate. This is providing limited protection against high explosive shells, but will not stop armour-piercing or semi-armour-piercing shells.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|152/53 mm Ansaldo mod.1926 (152 mm)}}

RN Bartolomeo Colleoni has 4 turrets with 2 x 152 mm cannons each. They can load normal HE, APHEBC, or HE-TF shells. The turrets all have good horizontal traverse range, and only a small angle is required for a full broadside salvo. The fire rate is very poor for its calibre, at 15 seconds reload with ace crew compared to other 6-inch guns with 10-second reload, but with good ballistics and explosive filler, the HE shells should still be able to quickly dispatch any unfortunate destroyers. The APHEBC shells are well suited for use against better-armoured targets, such as other cruisers. The HE-TF shell can be useful against aircraft, but are difficult to use efficiently due to their fixed timed fuse.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|100 mm/47 O.T.O. Mod. 1928 (100 mm)}}

RN Bartolomeo Colleoni has 6 x 100 mm cannons split into 3 turrets as secendary armament. They are positioned in the middle of the ship. Due to their placement, only two turrets can be fired in the same direction at the same time. Their reload speed is much better than the main cannons, as to be expected with the smaller calibre, which means they can be used efficiently as supplementary damage output while waiting for the main guns to reload. Three shell types are available: HE, APHE, and HE-TF*.

If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships is a catapult with one Ro.43 scout plane which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The Ro.43 is a 2 seater equipped with two fixed offensive light machine guns and a single defensive machine gun turret, but no bombs. It does have the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilise the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new!

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High top speed and manoeuvrability
* Very good gun firing angles, allowing the ship to fire at a steep angles and reduce the frontal profile
* One scout seaplane

'''Cons:'''

* Average anti-air defense
* Main guns has very poor rate of fire
* Very weak armour protection, the ship's barbettes in particular are completely exposed to enemy fire
