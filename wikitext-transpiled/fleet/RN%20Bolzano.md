The RN Bolzano, laid down on 11 June 1930, launched on 31 August 1932, completed and delivered on 19 August 1933, was a heavy cruiser based on the hull of the [[Trento (Family)|Trento class]]. RN Bolzano had several modifications and was practically a mixture of the [[Zara (Family)|Zara]] and Trento classes, featuring the powerplants and [[203 mm/53 Ansaldo mod.1927 (203 mm)|203 mm/53 Ansaldo mod.1927]] cannons of the Zara class with reduced protection on the main turrets, improved watertighting compartmentation compared to the Trento class, and other minor modifications. However, she proved to be weaker than the Zara class and therefore an almost useless upgrade. Upon entering service, RN Bolzano joined the naval forces deployed in the Mediterranean. During World War II, she participated in the Battle of Punta Stilo, in the interception of Allied ships involved in the British Operation Mincemeat, and in the Battle of Mid-August, during which she was severely damaged by a torpedo from the submarine HMS Unbroken. She would remain in the port of La Spezia and be abandoned after the armistice. On 22 June 1944, she was attacked by British and Italian assault craft, and only in April 1945 was she found, sunk and capsized by the American 5th Army and the first Italian Co-Belligerent units. She was later recovered and scrapped in 1949.

Introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]], RN Bolzano mixes features from [[RN Trento]] and [[RN Zara]]. The main armament is improved thanks to Zara's 203 mm cannons with a better reload, but the anti-air armament and armour protection remain mediocre. She has good manoeuvrability and speed, so it is recommended to play around hard cover such as islands to maximise survivability.

{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

Bolzano was ordered in the late 1920s as part of a larger Italian naval rearmament program. Unlike the Trento and Zara classes however, Bolzano represented a one-off construction combining design aspects of both the older Trento as well as the more advanced Zara class. After its commissioning in 1933, Bolzano had a rather uneventful initial interwar service. Throughout World War II however, Bolzano played a significant role in various naval engagements, including the Battle of Calabria and the Battle of Cape Spartivento. During these engagements, Bolzano's design proved its worth after surviving deadly torpedo attacks on several occasions. In 1943 however, with Italy's surrender looming and the threat of German occupation imminent, Bolzano was scuttled by her own crew in the port of La Spezia to prevent her capture.
