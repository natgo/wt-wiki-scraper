RN Conte di Cavour, lead ship of the [[Conte di Cavour (Family)|Conte di Cavour-class battleships]], was laid down on 10 August 1910, launched on 10 August 1911, and completed and delivered to the Regia Marina on 1 April 1915. On 24 May 1915, she became the flagship of Vice-Admiral Luigi Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta. During WWI, she did not participate in active missions, due to the passive policy adopted by the Italian and Austrian navies, spending 966 hours in exercises and only 40 hours in three bloodless war actions. From 1933 to 1937, she was modernised by the CRDA shipyards in Trieste, retaining only 40% of the original construction; in particular, the amidships turret was removed, while the remaining 305 mm cannons were increased to 320 mm. Additionally, engine power was increased to 93,000 hp.

She re-entered service on 1 June 1937 and was deployed to Taranto where she was at the outbreak of WW2. On 9 July 1940, she took part in the Battle of Punta Stilo, the first battleship engagement between the Regia Marina and the British Mediterranean Fleet. She was partially sunk by a torpedo dropped from a British torpedo bomber during the attack on the naval base of Taranto on the night of 11-12 November 1940. The salvage work lasted until the end of 1941 when she was towed to Trieste for restoration work, but she never returned to service and on 8 September 1943 was abandoned in the port of Trieste. On 10 September 1943, she was captured by the Germans but was abandoned by them and sunk during the bombardment of Trieste on 15 February 1945 by the Allies. She was finally struck off the state naval register on 27 February 1947.

Introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]] in her uncompleted 1943-1944 refit, the main armament of RN Conte di Cavour is quite good, able to inflict damage effectively with her SAP shells. When using the AP, remember to target weak points to maximize damage. The secondary armament is also not bad, as the 135 mm cannons can damage battleships and cruisers, and can be effective in sinking destroyers. The anti-aircraft armament consists of 65 mm and 20 mm cannons, perfect for medium and long range targets. Conte di Cavour's survivability and manoeuvrability are both good, for a battleship of her size.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

=== Devblog History ===
After the London Naval Treaty, Italy decided to strengthen its battle fleet. For external and internal reasons, the creation of a new class was abandoned in favor of the decision to comprehensively modify two existing ships — battleships Conte di Cavour and Giulio Cesare. The Conte di Cavour — the lead ship of the series built in 1911 — was redesigned by 60-70%, with work on the ship completed in 1937. With the outbreak of hostilities of World War II, she took part in the Battle of Calabria. In November she was attacked by Swordfish torpedo aircraft in the port of Taranto and went down from a direct hit from a torpedo to the side. She was raised in July 1941 and after being towed to Trieste, she was not put into service and did not take part in any further battles. In 1943 she was captured by the Germans, and in February 1945 was lost to Allied bombing.
