== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The RN Corazziere was laid down on 7 October 1937, launched on 22 May 1938, completed and commissioned on 4 March 1939, and was placed in the 12°Squadriglia cacciatorpediniere, then later in the 2°Squadra Navale, 3°Divisione Navale and C.C.FF.NN. ; before the Second World War, she mainly carried out training missions, with the Second World War she carried out an intense war activity in which she took part in most of the operations in the Mediterranean, the RN Corazziere carried out 135 war missions, 24 of which were escort and traffic protection, covering no less than 53,000 miles (85. 295 km), on 15 February the RN Corazziere was severely damaged by an enemy air attack and was stranded in the harbour basin in Naples, between 1 and 3 April she was towed to Genoa for major works, on 9 September 1943, she self-sank in Genoa then later captured by the Germans only to be sunk completely on 4 September 1944.

The RN Corazziere was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]] , the RN Corazziere as the other [[Soldati (Family)|Soldati-class]] is an excellent destroyer for its speed, manoeuvrability and torpedoes while, the armament is much less good, consisting of only 5 120mm cannons equipped only with AP and HE when used do not cause much damage, and for this reason, you have to learn to play very well with the AP to destroy enemy ships because they have , the anti-aircraft armament is mediocre and allows you to destroy enemies coastal boats and planes at medium and short range.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Corazziere has no armour whatsoever other than 12 mm anti-fragmentation shields protecting the main gun mounts. These mounts are, however, open-backed, and can be disabled by nearby explosions if they land behind the gun shield. There are also some large fuel tanks providing some degree of protection to the transmission and the stern and amidships main gun magazines.

The Corazziere has a massive unarmoured bridge that takes up almost the entirety of the forward superstructure, which makes her very vulnerable to getting the bridge disabled.

The Corazziere has a crew complement of 215 men, which is unremarkable for a destroyer at her battle rating.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The RN Corazziere is powered by 3 engines, which gives RN Corazziere the ability to achieve the maximum speed of 70 km/h in RB and 86 km/h in AB, while the reverse speed is 29 km/h in RB and 35 km/h in AB.

In both AB and RB modes, the RN Corazziere has very good acceleration both forward and backwards from a standstill, this gives you a better chance to dodge torpedoes or enemy salvoes. In combat, in a sustained turn the speed remains at 49 km/h in RB and 52 km/h in AB.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|120 mm/50 O.T.O. Mod.1936 (120 mm)}}

The Corazziere's main armament consists of five 120/50 OTO Mod. 1936 guns. Four of these are distributed in twin mounts located on the bow and stern, with the fifth located amidships in a single mount. These mounts have excellent traverse arcs, fast traverse and elevation speeds, but are crippled by their low rate of fire (8 rounds/minute with an aced crew).

The 120 mm guns can fire three types of ammunition: HE, AP, and HE-DF. The HE and HE-DF shells are identical in terms of filler, the primary difference being the HE-DF will burst at the range set by the rangefinder, allowing it to be used against aircraft. Both have weak explosive fillers (~1.6 kg TNT) compared to similar calibre destroyer guns, and are also considerably smaller than the ones of HE shells used by the older Italian destroyers such as the [[RN Leone|Leone]] and [[RN Turbine|Turbine]]. The AP shell has a fairly large filler for its type and calibre, approaching that of the HE shell at 1.3 kg TNT. It has reasonably good penetration capabilities as well, able to get through the belt armour of light cruisers at medium ranges.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)}}

Like almost all Italian ships, the Corazziere has very weak anti-aircraft armament. It consists of four twin 20/65 Breda Mod. 1935 cannon, two on each side of the ship. These are decent close range anti-aircraft weapons, but are too few to really provide effective protection.

Because of the railings surrounding these weapons, they cannot depress enough to engage surface targets closer than ~1.1 km, making them useless against coastal craft.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo I (533 mm)|B TG 100 depth charge}}

The Corazziere is armed with two triple 533 mm torpedo tubes located on the centreline. These fire the Si 270/533.2 x 7.2 Tipo I torpedo which has a speed and range of 76 km/h and 4 km (70 km/h and 10 km with torpedo mode installed), respectively. It carries a 270 kg TNT warhead.

She also has access to a depth charge (bomb) thrower, although the utility of this weapon against surface targets is questionable at best.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Corazziere has the speed to get to important locations quickly, but unfortunately is really lacking in firepower to make much of an impact. She has only five 120 mm guns that not only have a glacial reload time for a destroyer weapon but also have weak HE shell fillers. Her AP shell is reasonably good, but she simply doesn't have the damage output to fight head-to-head against most other destroyers, especially American ones. The torpedo armament is also fairly unremarkable, if serviceable once the torpedo mode is installed. The ship also has virtually no armour and is highly vulnerable to disabling hits to the massive bridge and the main guns. Her anti-aircraft defences are also quite poor and have a large deadzone against coastal boats.

With all this in mind, the Corazziere tends to fare very poorly in close-range brawls. Even when ambushing a target, her weak shells and low rate of fire can leave her outgunned by the ambushed target. She functions best in a supporting role, where she can rely on teammates to cover her many weaknesses.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
