== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
'''RN Giovanni Da Verazzano''' was laid down on 17 August 1927 as a scout cruiser, launched on 15 December 1928, and delivered to the Regia Marina on 25 September 1930. During the summer of 1933, the ship got a new refit with new additional anti-air guns and the replacement of the old 120 mm cannons with new ones, and was assigned to the 2°Squadriglia Esploratori della IV Divisione, 2°Squadra. Between 1936-1937, she took part in operations related to the Spanish Civil War. In April 1939, RN Giovanni Da Verazzano was downgraded to a destroyer and assigned to the 15th Destroyer Squadron. At the entry of Italy into WW2, she was at La Spezia undergoing hull enlargement works, which began on 1 May 1940 and was completed on 30 August. She then joined the VII Divisione Navale and participated in the bombardment of the Greek-Albanian coast on 18 December 1940. On 17 October 1942, during an escort to Libya, she was sighted by enemy submarines; she managed to dodge the first torpedo, but was struck by a second causing removal of the stern along with the rudder and propellers. All attempts to save the ship were in vain, and she was abandoned and sank.

Introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]], RN Giovanni Da Verazzano is a balanced destroyer, equipped with 120 mm cannons with a moderate reload time and the ability to equip AP shells for use against armoured targets. However, these cannons can be difficult to use, so expect to miss immediately or struggle to destroy enemy targets. The torpedoes are also quite good and can inflict serious damage or sink enemy ships immediately, while the anti-air armament is mediocre at long-range anti-air defence but provides excellent medium and close range protection. The survivability, manoeuvrability, and speed of the vessel are also quite good.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Da Verazzano is a mid-to-long-range fighter. She has a low rate of fire so in the combat you should always stick to AP shells and aim the vital parts of ship for maximum damage. From 5 km range and beyond, it usually takes two salvoes to blast an enemy ship's magazine. The ship has a reasonable module layout and she's safe from detonation so it should be easy to triumph in a one-on-one engagement. In small open water maps (Fiji for example), you can simply turn your ship at the spawn point, show your broadside and pick out enemies in the opposite spawn one by one.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 6 guns with powerful 120 mm APCBC shells
* Mid-ship turret has excellent forward-firing sector
* Reasonable module layout and magazine protection

'''Cons:'''

* Low rate of fire
* Rear turret has very poor firing sector with only ±130°, she must show broadside to maximize firepower
* Very weak anti-air capability, her 40 mm HE-TF poses no threat to aircraft
