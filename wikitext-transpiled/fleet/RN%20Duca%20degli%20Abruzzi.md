The '''RN Luigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi''' was the first ship of the [[Condottieri_(Family)#Duca degli Abruzzi-class|Duca degli Abruzzi-subclass]] of Condottieri cruisers, commissioned 1 December 1937. During World War 2, she saw naval combat only once, in the Battle of Punta Stilo, where she engaged British 7th Cruiser Squadron without scoring any hits. In November 1941, she had her stern blown off by a torpedo from a British aircraft based on Malta, which was later repaired. After the Armistice, she surrendered at Malta and served as an anti-blockade-runner, patrolling the central Atlantic from Freetown in Sierra Leone. After the end of World War 2, she underwent three refits - in 1947, 1951-53, and 1955 - serving in the Italian navy until 1961.

The most advanced of the Italian Condottieri-class cruisers, '''{{Specs|1=name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]]. She's in a higher BR than the previous vessels of the class, making her fight against much more challenging opponents, as a result she struggles to deal with opponents due to a small explosive filler, low rate of fire, and insufficient armour to deal with enemy vessels. She's best used to support friendlies with torpedoes and picking off the weakest targets in the enemy team to avoid attention from the most challenging opponents.

'''Pros:'''

* Heavier armour and higher crew count than previous Italian light cruisers
* Receives a slightly improved AP shell compared to previous Italian light cruisers
* 2 more guns than previous Italian light cruisers

'''Cons:'''

* The guns have a lower RoF than those of previous Italian light cruisers(but the total broadside remains comparable due to the increase in barrel count)
* Somewhat lackluster AA armament
* No scout aircraft
* Slower max speed compared to previous Italian light cruisers

During the early 1930s, the Regia Marina defined requirements for a new light cruiser whose capabilities should allow it to effectively face off even heavy cruisers thanks to improved combat characteristics. To achieve this, Italian shipbuilders opted for increasing the new design's firepower and giving it a revised armour scheme at the expense of some mobility. Once the design was drawn up, an order for the construction of two ships - Luigi di Savoia duca degli Abruzzi and Giuseppe Garibaldi - was issued with both being laid down in 1933.

The construction of both vessels progressed slowly as parallel developments and tests of other warships constantly led to revisions and modifications of their design. Nonetheless, both vessels were simultaneously completed and commissioned into service in December 1937. During WWII, both vessels served as part of the VII Cruiser Division, taking part in only one major naval battle during the war - the Battle of Punta Stilo in July 1940 - in which the ships exchanged fire with Royal Navy cruisers. For the remainder of the war, the ships would only assist in secondary tasks such as escorting convoys, as they were considered too valuable to be potentially lost due to their advanced design. In July 1941, both ships suffered torpedo strikes on two separate occasions yet managed to return to port under their own power.

After the Italian Armistice in 1943, both vessels fought side by side with the Allied forces as part of several missions. Surviving WWII, Duca degli Abruzzi and Giuseppe Garibaldi would both serve on with the Italian postwar Navy for decades to come thanks to extensive modernizations during the 1950s. While Duca degli Abruzzi would ultimately be decommissioned in 1961, Giuseppe Garibaldi would go on to serve until 1971 before being retired from active service.
