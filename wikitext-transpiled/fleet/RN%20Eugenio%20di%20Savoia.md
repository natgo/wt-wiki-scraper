== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

The Eugenio di Savoia is a Duca d'Aosta-class cruiser, a member of the fourth group of the [[Condottieri-class]] of Italian light cruisers. She has improved armour protection compared to her predecessor, the [[RN Raimondo Montecuccoli|Raimondo Montecuccoli]], while still maintaining the same armament and speed.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
[[File:RN-Eugenio-di-Savoia-Armor.jpg|thumb|right|Overview of the protection scheme]]
The ship enjoys one of the better armour schemes among the light cruisers.

Its shells and magazines are divided into two separate rooms, both located below the waterline, with inert shells being closer to the surface and explosive magazines located deeper underwater. Unlike some other light cruisers, such as those of the Japanese navy, the ship does not store ready-to-use ammunition above the waterline, making it less susceptible to ammunition explosions.

The ship's armour includes three layers of protection: external bulges, internal citadel armour, and fuel tanks that further reduce casualties from centre-mass hits. This armour scheme allows the ship to survive multiple torpedo hits in the centre of mass, although the underwater magazines are still vulnerable to explosions from nearby torpedo impacts.

The ship's [[152/53 mm O.T.O. Mod.1929 (152 mm)|152 mm O.T.O. Mod.1929]] turrets have uparmoured faces with 90 mm RHA armour, which is superior to that of most foreign light cruisers at its battle rating or lower, and is surpassed only by the late-war US light cruisers with [[6 inch/47 Mk.16 (152 mm)|Mk.16 triple turrets]] in a higher battle rating. 

This armour scheme makes Eugenio di Savoia a relatively resilient ship compared to its peers, despite having a relatively small crew count. The ship has excellent protection against destroyers at close range, but struggles against high-calibre {{Annotation|SAP|Semi-armour-piercing}} and {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}} shells commonly found on heavy cruisers in its battle rating range.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
With an increase in armour comparing to [[RN Raimondo Montecuccoli|its predecessor]] comes a decrease in mobility. In real terms though, both ships are extremely capable, the slight decrease in the maximum speed doesn't have any real effect on the battlefield, and the manoeuvrability is still sufficient to avoid torpedoes after they are spotted. Comparing to the equivalents from other nations its still both: quicker and more agile, besting even the Japanese [[Agano]].

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
After unlocking Tools and Fire Protection System go for the 152 mm APHEBC Palla shell - it unlocks the true killing potential of this cruiser, turning it from just a destroyer hunter, into a warship that can deal with enemy cruisers. Following that there are two routes: Either going an offensive route - unlocking the three Targeting upgrades - or going the defensive route, unlocking Rudder Replacement as a third tier II upgrade, then Shrapnel Protection into Ventilation. Also the 100 mm HE-TF Contro-aerea shells can be worth consideration as the third tier III upgrade.

Tier IV offers a number of key upgrades: Engine Maintenance gives a huge improvement in mobility. Ammo Wetting prevents these ammo explosions from fires onboard. Torpedo Mode finally makes torpedoes usable on a regular basis (an upgrade especially beneficial in the arcade mode). And finally, the [[Shipboard reconnaissance aircraft|Hydroplane]] enables you to quickly capture the points, which improves the win-rate and allows for easier completion of some of the [[Daily missions#Battle tasks|Daily and Special tasks]].

There are several modifications that can be left for last, notably: Dry-Docking and Propeller Replacement take a secondary role, as the ship already enjoys a good mobility, while there are more impactful upgrades in the respective tiers. Smokescreen generally has a limited use on light cruisers unless they are used in a higher BR matches. 100 mm APHE brings little value with the low number of secondaries and poor AI accuracy while the primaries have a short reload time. Improved Rangefinder has a limited benefit even in the Realistic battles and is nearly totally useless in Arcade. And finally Bomb mortar - if other upgrades listed here are situational - this brings situational to the whole new level, and generally should be unlocked only as the very last modification on the ship.

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|152/53 mm O.T.O. Mod.1929 (152 mm)}}

Firing 8-shell 152mm broadside puts Eugenio di Savoia in an obvious disadvantage against most of its peers, and without a high rate of fire its sustained damage output per minute is not impressive either. Looking at the most extreme: [[Kirov]] can output nearly triple the HE-equivalent using respective ships default shells.

Default HE shells are great against destroyers and other weakly or unarmoured targets, but having a relatively low explosive filler, they fail to consistently ignite enemy warships on fire. APHEBC Palla shells on the other hand are great at causing enemy magazines to explode, as the ballistic cap makes these shells perform exceptionally well against angled armour, and thus - penetrating deep into the hull even at extreme ranges. HE-TF are your typical anti-air shells, they can be relatively useful thanks to the turrets vertical guidance of up to +45° and a high shell velocity 935 m/s.

{{:152/53 mm O.T.O. Mod.1929 (152 mm)/Ammunition|152 mm HE Dirompente, 152 mm APHEBC Palla, 152 mm HE-TF Contro-aerea}}

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|100 mm/47 O.T.O. Mod. 1928 (100 mm)}}

With just three dual-mount secondaries these guns play primarily a long-range anti-air role. Vertical guidance of +80° with 850 m/s muzzle velocity makes these guns able to harass enemy planes both: at a long range or a shorter distance, but a high altitude. Guns have a good coverage, with at least two turrets always being able to launch shells every 6.25 second.

Where these guns fail is the anti-ship and anti-boat role, as there's simply too few of them with a too poor firing arcs to effectively counter naval targets. For a rapid anti-boat duty switching to anti-air armament (default <kbd>Alt+3</kbd> on PC) can be a better option except for the rear-most arc, where the 37 mm cannons cannot reach and two or even all three 100 mm turrets are available.

{{:100 mm/47 O.T.O. Mod. 1928 (100 mm)/Ammunition|100 mm HE Dirompente, 100 mm APHE Perforante, 100 mm HE-TF Contro-aerea}}

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|37 mm/54 Breda Mod.32 (37 mm)|20 mm/70 Oerlikon 3S (20 mm)}}

While far from the best, Eugenio di Savoia enjoys a considerable anti-air capability, with cannons often being able to destroy enemy bombers before they even drop the bombs (which doesn't stop them dropping the deadly payload post-mortem). Just as with most of the ships, it's best to align perpendicularly to the incoming medium or high-altitude bombers, offering the most guns on target, while being the smallest target for the falling bombs. On the other hand, against torpedo bombers it's best to go in parallel, exposing it either to three 100 mm turrets and added 20 mm Oerlikons in the rear, or four 37mm Bredas in frontal arc.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|B TG depth charge|S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo M (533 mm)}}

The RN Eugenio di Savoia carries 6 torpedoes, 3 on either side of the ship with a very wide firing angle. In the Arcade mode torpedoes from both sides have to be dropped for a reload to occur, which means you're often best to dump the torpedoes without a target. In For realistic mode cruiser doesn't carry any reload.

Torpedoes themselves are situational, with an extremely short range of 4 km being the key limiting factor. Italian designers opted for a much higher speed in exchange for range, and thus Tipo M enjoys exceptional 93 km/h speed while maintaining a relatively large and potent warhead. Torpedo Mode turns it into a respectable 12 km range at 83 km/h, which makes it one of the best torpedoes in the game.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships is a catapult with one Ro.43 scout plane which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The Ro.43 is a 2 seater equipped with two fixed offensive light machine guns and a single defensive machine gun turret, but no bombs. It does have the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilize the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new!

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
[[File:RN-Eugenio-di-Savoia-A-cap-on-MediterraneanPort.jpg|thumb|right|When pushing the cap point near enemy [[:Category:Boats|boat]] spawn it's worth to manually aim your potent, quick-firing AA guns (using "Select anti-aircraft weapons", default <kbd>Alt+3</kbd> on PC) and if a boat drops torpedoes - it's best to take the impact directly into the bow, which will negate most of the damage]]
Stock Eugenio di Savoia shows its roots as a destroyer-hunter, being unable to counter heavier threats, while enjoying a relative immunity to the low-calibre shells. With an addition of APHEBC it becomes a very respectable light cruiser, being able to counter its equivalents from other nations as well as harassing heavier warships. Finally the Torpedo Mode gives a real potential for surprise attacks against Heavy Cruisers and larger warships, especially in the Arcade mode, where the ship hugely benefits from an infinite reload of the torpedoes.

A good mobility and protection make this ship a great tool for pushing cap points and asserting dominance in the area. Typically for a light cruiser, positioning is still the key though - while its good high speed allows for a relatively prompt relocation once enemy has an overwhelming firepower, it's still best to foresee enemy movement - in particular Heavy Cruisers - and simply give them space while allies inflict damage. No ship can survive being focused down by the enemies, so care should be taken to avoid positioning oneself into such a situation.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
It's a true multi-role cruiser, being able to manage all kinds of threats. It's not exceptional in any way, but it doesn't have any huge weakness either. In relation to the other Light Cruisers, on the Mobility - Security - Firepower triangle it's trending towards lower firepower for a better survivability and mobility.

[[File:Eugenio di Savoia motto.jpg|thumb|Ship's motto visible on the aft-most turret.]]
The [[Condottieri (Family)|Condottieri-class cruiser]] Eugenio di Savoia was the second vessel in the fourth sub-class of its class. It featured improved armour and machinery compared to her predecessor, the Raimondo Montecuccoli. The ship was named after [[wikipedia:Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prince Eugene of Savoy]], whose motto "''Ubi Sabaudia ibi Victoria''" ("''Where there is (Eugene of) Savoy, there is Victory''") was inscribed on the sides of turret number 4. 

It was constructed by Ansaldo in Genoa, being laid down on July 6, 1933, launched on March 16, 1935, and commissioned on January 16, 1936. The Eugenio di Savoia saw her first combat action during the Spanish Civil War on February 13, 1937, and later undertook a global circumnavigation with its sister ship, the Duca d'Aosta, from 1938 to March 1939. During World War II, the cruiser participated in the [[wikipedia:Battle of Calabria|Battle of Calabria]], the [[wikipedia:Operation Harpoon (1942)|Battle of mid-June]], and the [[wikipedia:Operation Pedestal|Battle of mid-August]]. In the latter engagement, it damaged the [[Tribal (Family)|Tribal-class destroyer]] HMS Bedouin near [[wikipedia:Pantelleria|Pantelleria]] island. On December 4, 1942, the Eugene of Savoy was struck by a [[B-24|Liberator]] bomber, resulting in 17 deaths and 46 injuries. Repairs took 40 days, and upon its return to service in January 1943, the cruiser's anti-aircraft batteries shot down an unknown number of allied bombers.

After Italy's armistice with the Allies on [[wikipedia:Armistice of Cassibile|3 September 1943]], she sailed to Malta and then on to Alexandria, Egypt, where she was interned with her crew. Up to that point, the ship had completed 25 war missions and sailed 25,000 nautical miles.

In October 1943, she returned to service with the Allies and served as a target for training missions for new pilots near Suez. In February 1944, she was ordered to return to [[wikipedia:Taranto|Taranto]], Italy in order to transport the crews of the Regia Marina back to Italy. However, on the way, the ship struck a mine near Punta Stilo on the southwest coast of Italy. She was able to reach Taranto on her own power but remained in the harbor until the end of the war.

Post-war repairs and refitting were not completed until 26 June 1951, at which point the Eugenio di Savoia was ceded to Greece as part of war reparations. 

=== Greek service ===
Renamed C-24 Έλλη II (C-24 Elli II), with her [[wikipedia:Ensign|ensign]] hoisted in June 1951, she became the headquarters of the Chief of the Greek Fleet and effectively the flagship of the newly formed Hellenic Navy. In June 1952, she carried the Greek king, Paul of Greece, on a visit to Istanbul. From 1959 to 1965, she served as the flagship of the Ionian Fleet stationed in Suda, Crete, however she rarely set sail, citing high costs for the young navy.

In 1965, the C-24 Έλλη II was decommissioned from the fleet after 14 years of service in the Hellenic Navy and 29 years of history. Her final chapter was infamous, as she was turned into a prison ship by the [[wikipedia:Greek junta|Greek junta]] and used to imprison members of the navy who opposed the dictatorship until the [[wikipedia:Greek junta#Ioannidis coup and regime|1973 coup]]. She was eventually sold for scrap.
