The RN Gabbiano (C 11) was the first ship of her class to enter service on 3 October 1942. She would see a long operational history from World War II until the post-war period. She was part of the 1st Corvette Squadron during World War II. Before the armistice, she went on 102 missions of which 18 were hunting enemy submarines and 22 escort missions to convoys or isolated ships. On 24 April 1943, she destroyed the British submarine HMS Sahib near Milazzo. After the cessation of hostilities in May 1945, the corvette RN Gabbiano was in the port of Naples. It was brought to Taranto arsenal in 1947 for various maintenance works and was later christened Gabbiano F-571, which became part of the first group assigned to the Commando School in 1948. Eventually, it was replaced, along with other aging corvettes, by the new [[Albatros F543|Albatros-class]] in 1955, and later by the De Cristofaro-class corvettes in 1966. The Gabbiano F-571 was placed in reserve to be later decommissioned on 1 November 1971, by Decree of the President of the Republic of 14 January 1972.

The RN Gabbiano was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]]. It is a corvette with a poor speed that limits its manoeuvrability and ability to dodge torpedoes and enemy hits. The armament, on the other hand, is very good because you can use it against almost any target you will encounter. With the 100 mm gun, you can damage enemy destroyers, while the 20 mm is very useful against light targets and aircraft.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The RN Gabbiano same like Folaga F-576 has extraordinary survivability, difficult to shoot down by enemy coastal ships and aircraft, the 112 crew can quickly repair the ship when it is disabled as it is difficult to do much damage to it and sink it directly, however against destroyers attention to them because if they have APs and SAPs, they can one shot you, from your ammo rack.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The ship's top speed of 33 km/h is not very good due to its electric motors, good acceleration and manoeuvrability, but due to the low speed, you will struggle to dodge enemy hits and torpedoes, try to find a good place to position your self so you can destroy the enemy target and stay safe from little ships that have dangerous torpedoes and depth charges.

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|100 mm/47 O.T.O. Mod. 1937 (100 mm)}}

RN Gabbiano as primary armament has a single 100mm/47 OTO Mod.1937 cannon placed in front, this cannon gives the RN Gabbiano the ability to damage enemy destroyers more easily thanks to its APHE and HE, capable of destroying enemy ship's components and diminishing the crew of the enemy ship, while for the anti-aircraft role, you could use the HE-FT but don't use them due to the reloading, speed of the cannon to turn on itself and for the Time fuze that makes it impractical.

{{main|20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)|20 mm/70 Scotti-Isotta Fraschini mod.1939 (20 mm)}}

The secondary armament consists of two twin 20mm Breda turrets positioned at the rear of the ship and three single 20mm Scotti-Isotta Fraschini mod.1939 turrets positioned on the sides and behind the 100mm gun, the secondary armament is very good against light targets and enemy aircraft so to save you from situations where there are enemy aircraft, torpedo bombers I recommend you use this armament instead of the main 100mm.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I.170/450X5,25 (450 mm)|WBG depth charge}}

The additional armament on the RN Gabbiano consists of two single 450mm torpedo launchers placed on the sides of the ship, these torpedoes are the best armament versus the destroyer, at last of additional armament there are six depth charge launchers also placed on the sides, the torpedoes are always good for destroying enemy destroyers and others boats that are very slow or you can have a good aim and get a fast target while the depth charges will be difficult to use unless you are very close to the enemy ship but is a very rare situation.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The RN Gabbiano is a corvette with enough survivability thanks to the early battle spawn in the coastal one you can position yourself in great areas to destroy enemy coastal ships, and thus gain many research points and silver lions, however, use the secondary armament composed entirely of 20mm against coastal ships to maximise the damage inflicted on them and thus destroy them quickly without problems, while the 100mm uses APHE and HE against destroyers and don't use HE-FT's which are very ineffective against air and naval targets so only use HE and APHE against enemy destroyers and if you are close enough use your additional armament of torpedoes and depth charges to shoot down the enemy ship, and finally remember that due to the speed suit, you will struggle to dodge enemy hits and torpedoes so try to be careful around your surroundings.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Effective AA armament
* Boat spawn
* Excellent Survivability

'''Cons:'''

* Inadequate armament to fight dstroyers and bigger ships
* Very slow

==== WW2 - RN Gabbiano (C 11) ====
RN Gabbiano (C 11), was the first corvette of the Gabbiano class of the same name, completed and entered into service on 3 October 1942, it would see a long operational history from World War II until the post-war period, after several exercises and crew training, held in La Spezia, assigned to the 1st Squadriglia Corvette, based in Trapani, it was relocated to the Sicilian port, beginning immediately on 5 January 1943, her wartime activity, escorting several Italian and German convoys on the Trapani-Tunis route, was only the beginning of her long operational history of these missions, during the convoy escorts she was often attacked by enemy aircraft, one of the most serious damages caused by the bombing in Palermo on 1 March 1943, rendered the RN Gabbiano (C 11) incapacitated and put under repair in Messina from 5 March until 13 April.

Before the armistice, the RN Gabbiano (C 11) carried out 102 missions of which 18 were anti-submarine hunts and 22 escorts to convoys or isolated merchantmen, she was also the corvette that travelled the most miles in the war, that is 14384 miles, and did the most hours of motion, that is 1548, used the anti-submarine armament on two occasions in 1943, on 17 February 1943 escorting a convoy departing from Trapani, without a controlled outcome, while during the escort of 24 April 1943 near Milazzo I led to the sinking of the British submarine HMS Sahib.

HMS Sahib had already sunk with a torpedo the steamer RN Galiola, which was being escorted by the corvette RN Gabbiano (C 11) and the torpedo boats RN Climene, RN Angelo Bassini and RN Euterpe, again the British submarine tried to destroy the RN Gabbiano (C 11) but failed the feat and was destroyed by depth charges that made HMS Sahib go to the surface and then be shot down by the gun of the RN Gabbiano (C 11), Also in 1943 she helped the allied ships, doing salvage, escort and rescue missions in different parts of Italy until the armistice where from September 1943 until April 1945, the RN Gabbiano (C 11) escorted convoys and allied steamships in Mediterranean waters, going to the ports of free Italy, Malta, Bizerte and Algiers.

==== After the war - Gabbiano (F-571) ====
After the cessation of hostilities on 8 May 1945, the corvette Gabbiano was in the port of Naples, immediately after the war she carried out transports of people and materials between the South and the North of Italy to make up for the lack of land communications, she spent much time in the Taranto Arsenal in 1947 for major maintenance, the corvette now renamed Gabbiano F-571 was part of the 1st Group of units assigned to the Command School in 1948, after Italy entered into NATO she participated, as Head of the Flotilla School, in some combined exercises of the Atlantic Alliance.

He was a member of the 4th Squadriglia Corvette dependent on the 3rd Naval Division; then, from September 1950, of the 1st Squadriglia Corvette and, from October 1950, of the 3rd Squadron; subsequently transferred to the 1st Naval Division, he was taken over as Squadron Leader of the 2nd, 1st and 4th Squadrons of the Command School Flotilla, then in October 1961 returned to the 3rd Naval Division, again as Squadron Leader of the Command School Flotilla.

==== Destiny ====
In 1951 at the Arsenal of La Spezia from 1 January until December and in the same year from 1 December 1954 to 26 May 1955.

When the first units of the [[Albatros F543|Albatros-class]] entered service in 1955, and then in 1966, with the assignment to the school of the first corvette of the De Cristofaro-class, units that were more modern, faster and with much superior equipment than the corvettes of old, and the old corvettes were progressively replaced, the corvette Gabbiano F-571 went into reserve and was then later dismasted on 1 November 1971, by Decree of the President of the Republic of 14 January 1972.
