== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/6690-development-italian-fleet-early-access-packs-en|premium pack]] in [[Update "Starfighters"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6924-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-in-gaijin-net-store-en|8th Anniversary Sale]]. It has been made available for purchase with Golden Eagles {{ge}} briefly during the [[wt:en/news/7733-special-italian-navy-day-en|2022]] and [[wt:en/news/7733-special-italian-navy-day-en|2023 "Italian Navy Day"]] mini-events.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The RN Geniere in terms of survivability is very resilient, thanks to 215 crew members the ship can withstand various fire damage or enemy salvoes and repair damage and put out fires without losing too much crew.

Whereas RN Geniere is protected in the hull by 16 mm steel, superstructure 4 mm, while the only part more armored externally from the hull are the 12 mm protected cannons, the RN Geniere's hold in the rear part is protected by the tanks and it is rare that I can cause you a hold, while the front part the hold is protected only by the 16 mm steel hull which however is not very useful because eventually they can blow your ammorack easily and make you lose the ship in no time

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The RN Geniere is powered by 3 engines, which gives RN Geniere the ability to achieve the maximum speed of 70 km/h in RB and 86 km/h in AB , while the reverse speed is 29 km/h in RB and 35 km/h in AB.

In both AB and RB, RN Geniere has very good acceleration to both go forward and reverse from a standstill, this gives you a better chance to dodge torpedoes or even salvo enemy.

In combat if you continue to turn the speed remains 49 km/h in RB and 52 km/h in AB.

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|120 mm/50 O.T.O. Mod.1936 (120 mm)}}

The primary armament consists of five [[120 mm/50 O.T.O. Mod.1936 (120 mm)|120 mm/50 Mod.1936]], 2 of which are twin and one single, these guns can carry 3 different projectiles:

* HE has 1.63 kg of explosives and can cause serious damage if used on the top of enemy ships,
* HE-TF has 1.63 kg of explosive unlike HE projectiles these in particular has a time fuse that is automatically configured during target aiming and practically explode based on the time and distance of the perfect configuration against aerial targets,
* APHEBC has 1.3 kg of explosives and can cause serious internal damage to the enemy ship if they are used against ammo racks and engines.

{{:120 mm/50 O.T.O. Mod.1936 (120 mm)/Ammunition|120 mm HE Dirompente, 120 mm APCBC Perforante, 120 mm HE-TF Contro-aerea}}

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)}}

The secondary armament consists of twelve [[20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)|20 mm/65 Breda]], all the guns are twin-mounted.

These AA turrets are perfect for short range 1-3 km, while for long and medium range they are not very effective, they are also perfect for small ships that try to attack you with torpedoes as torpedo boats.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo I (533 mm)|B TG 100 depth charge}}

The additional armament consists of six 533 mm [[S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo I (533 mm)|S.I. 270/533.4X7.2 Tipo I]] torpedoes and two [[B TG 100 depth charge|B TG 100]] depth charges

The torpedoes are placed in the center of the ship can only be launched when pointing left or right, due to the torpedo mode modification the torpedo range can be increased but the speed is reduced.

Depth charges, on the other hand, are placed in launchers one on the left and one on the right, you have to use them in a certain way because they are not dropped into the water but are launched for a few tens of meters 

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
When using RN Geniere during the battle don't go too much close to enemy ships or go in zone where are not any cover, because you can be instantly dead.

The best tactic with the RN Geniere is  find a cover and start to shoot the enemy ship in specific with APHEBC in the engines and ammorack and with HE the top of the ship.

When they start to respond your attack go back in the cover, if the enemy is coming close to you use your torpedoes and aim to the ammorack (basically under the enemy turrets), some rare cases you can use the depth charges but they cause a little damage to enemy big ships as destroyers and frigates, meanwhile the little ones can be easily killed by the charges or by the AA armament composed by 20 mm (the best belt to use is the Universale one).

If you find an open map don't quit it, you gonna combat from long distance so after you spawned start to shot to the enemy ship that are more close to you and start to distance from them, if they shot back dodge the enemy salvo, and continue your attack, some times use your smoke screen if there are too much enemies shotting you.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Capable of withstanding significant damage from fire and enemy salvoes
* Very manoeuvrable, allowing it to cooperate well with light craft
* Don't loss too much speed when dodge torpedoes or enemy salvoes
* Outstanding acceleration

'''Cons:'''

* Only short range AA guns, very inefficient for medium and long range
* Can be ammoracked very easily in the front of the ship

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

=== RN Geniere ===
[[File:RN Geniere Sail 1.png|thumb|RN Geniere during sail ]]
Set up in Livorno by the OTO on August 26, 1937, and completed on December 15, 1938.

On December 15, 1938, it entered service in the Regia Marina.

On entry into the war was part of the XI Squadriglia Cacciatorpediniere,, which formed together with the twin 

[[RN Aviere]], RN Artigliere and RN Camicia Nera.

In 1940, was part of several patrol, enemy search and escort operations in the Sicilian Channel, areas near Libya and Malta.

In 1941, the Geniere had its 120/15 illuminating gun replaced with a [[120 mm/50 O.T.O. Mod.1936 (120 mm)|120/50 OTO Mod.1936]] gun . The original AA armament of [[Breda Model 31 (13.2 mm)|13.2 mm Breda]] MGs was replaced by [[20 mm/65 Breda (20 mm)|20 mm/65 Breda]] cannons in 6 twin emplacements. 
[[File:RN Geniere combat I.png|thumb|RN Geniere during shotting exercises]]
In 1942 I participated in some escorts with other destroyers and took part in the Battaglia di mezzo Agosto.

On the night of August 11-12, 1942, during the Battaglia di mezzo Agosto, took to the sea with Divisioni incrociatori III (RN Trieste, RN Gorizia and RN Bolzano) and Divisioni incrociatori VII ([[RN Eugenio di Savoia]], RN Attendolo and [[RN Raimondo Montecuccoli]]) and 9 destroyers: the objective was to attack the British convoy "Pedestal," already decimated by attacks from aircraft, submarines and torpedo motorboats, and annihilate it; however, the Italian formation was turned back for fear of adversary attacks, but during the very navigation of return, on August 13, the submarine HMS Unbroken torpedoed and severely damaged RN Bolzano and RN Attendolo: the RN Geniere and [[RN Aviere]] took the burning RN Bolzano in tow and ran it aground near Panarea.

On March 1, 1943 was Sank from an American aerial bombardment in the harbor.

After armistice it was recovered for demolition.

In April 1944, refitted so that it could float, it was taken in tow to be towed to Taranto; during that sailing, however, the leaks reopened, the cables snapped, and the RN Geniere sank.

=== [[wt:en/news/6690-development-italian-fleet-early-access-packs-en|Devblog]] ===
Geniere was laid down as part of the first series of Soldati-class destroyers for the Regia Marina. Geniere comes to War Thunder naval forces in one of its later war modifications, specifically in the 1942 fit. The ship features five 120 mm cannons split into three turrets. Geniere offers better AA option, than a regular tree destroyer, having 6 twin-barrelled 20 mm Breda autocannons, rationally positioned over her deck. It's also worth mentioning that Geniere comes with two triple torpedo launchers, which make her combat application more versatile. As all Soldati destroyers, Geniere boasts an excellent top speed going up to 35 knots (65 km/h), as well as great manoeuvrability.
