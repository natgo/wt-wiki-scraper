== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
Battleship Leonardo da Vinci was launched in 1911 and commissioned in 1914. The first two years of her career were spent at harbour, due to fears of Austro-Hungarian torpedo attack. In August 1916, she fell victim to an internal explosion due to spontaneous ignition of the main armament propellant charges. The Regia Marina made a decision to recover the wreck, which turned upside down and sunk in the mud at the bottom of the harbour. Refloating wasn't completed until 1919 and righting the ship took until January 1921. The reconstruction of the wreck was estimated to cost 60 million lira - a sum beyond the capabilities of the post-war navy. After numerous attempts to allocate the funding, the Italian Navy finally gave up in 1923 and struck the vessel off the registry, sending the hull to Taranto to be broken up.

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], RN Leonardo da Vinci is by far the weakest of the [[Conte di Cavour (Family)|Conte di Cavour-class]] battleships, lacking the armour and armament of the other vessels in the class. The greatest weakness is its stern ammo racks exposed above the waterline. It has overall good armour for its BR and can be used to aggressively push capture points, but it lacks flexibility to retreat without risking deadly hits in the stern.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
