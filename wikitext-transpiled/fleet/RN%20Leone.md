== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

The Leone was originally designed as an "esploratore" (scout cruiser). As such, she is significantly larger than contemporary destroyers of the early 1920s and carries a heavy gun armament at the expense of less torpedoes. Despite her design preceding the [[RN Comandante Margottini|Comandante Margottini]] and [[Corazziere]] by some 20 years, she is a larger and more heavily armed ship, and thus comes after them in the Italian bluewater tech tree.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The RN Leone has no armour whatsoever other than 12 mm plating partially protecting her main gun mounts.

Her bow main gun ammunition magazine is partially exposed above the waterline. This makes it more vulnerable to penetrating hits, which will detonate the ammunition magazine with immediately fatal results. The stern magazine is below the waterline, and thus less vulnerable.

The Leone has a crew of 206 men, which is slightly smaller than that of the preceding RN Corazziere.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Leone is somewhat slower than her immediate predecessor, Corazziere, and also has poorer handling and acceleration characteristics due to her greater length and bulk, although they are still acceptable.

{{main|120 mm/45 Canet-Schneider-Armstrong mod.1918-19 (120 mm)}}

The Leone has a heavy gun armament (for a destroyer) of eight 120/45 Canet-Schneider-Armstrong Mod. 1918/19 main guns. These fire the same shells as the 120/45 OTO Mod. 1926 guns on the Italian reserve destroyer [[RN Turbine|Turbine]] and have generally identical performance to them as well. They are distributed in four twin mounts, one in the bow, one in the stern, and the other two amidships. Three of these mounts have unlimited traverse, but the one sited between the funnels cannot be traversed fully because of the fore funnel blocking the guns. The guns have a fairly low rate of fire of only 7 rounds/minute maximum with an aced crew.

The 120 mm guns fire HE, HE-DF, and APHE shells. The HE (and identical HE-DF) shells have a large filler for a 120 mm shell at 2.39 kg of TNT, which is significantly more than those of the newer 120 mm HE shells used by the [[Dardo]] and Corazziere and even the larger 135 mm HE shells of the [[RN Comandante Margottini|Comandante Margottini]], [[RN Attilio Regolo|Attilio Regolo]], and [[RN Etna|Etna]]. However, her APHE has less filler than the APHE on those other ships. HE-DF explodes at the range set by the rangefinder, primarily for anti-aircraft usage, but the limited gun elevation makes the main guns quite hard to use in the anti-aircraft role.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|40 mm/39 Vickers-Terni mod.1915/1917, Modif.1930 (40 mm)}}

The secondary armament on the RN Leone consists of two single 40mm turrets with HE-FT (Timed Explosive Projectile), these two 40mm cannons are not very effective at long and medium ranges, but at short ranges they manage to cause a lot of damage to enemy aircraft, in particular try not to use these cannons on enemy ships because they do not cause any significant damage, compared to the RN Tigre of the same class it does not have the 76mm which are very useful against small ships and long ranges for anti-aircraft role

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Breda Model 31 (13.2 mm)}}

The anti-aircraft armament consists of two twin 13.2mm Breda Model 31 turrets, thanks to their rate of fire and reload time, these machine guns are very useful against short and medium-range air targets as well as coastal ships.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 250/533,4X7,5 Tipo A (533 mm)}}

The additional armament on the RN Leone consists of two twin torpedo launchers containing the S.I. 250/533.4X7.5 Type A (533 mm) torpedoes with a decent explosive and destructive power, without torpedo mode the torpedo can reach a distance of 4 km at 76 km/h while with torpedo mode it can reach 12 km with a speed of 48 km/h, the best tactic with torpedoes is always to launch them at the right moments when either there are obstacles that the enemy ship cannot easily pass through while in the case of battles without obstacles you need a little luck.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The RN Leone sacrifices torpedo armament for heavier main gun armament. With a large salvo of eight fairly powerful HE shells, she can deal a substantial amount of damage to opposing destroyers with a single salvo. However, the low rate of fire of the main guns also mean that she cannot really compete in a prolonged duel against fast-firing destroyers (particular the American ones with 5"/38 main guns), and despite her larger size she actually has a smaller crew count than the RN Corazziere and RN Comandante Margottini. Furthermore, her partially exposed bow ammunition magazine is a dangerous weakness, especially in close range fights.

Her torpedo armament is very poor, with only four fairly underwhelming 533 mm torpedoes that are not particularly fast and that have a very short range of only 4 km without the torpedo mode installed. It is worth considering not bringing them at all, especially since they are a potential hazard if hit by enemy fire. 

It is also worth noting that the RN Leone has better firing angles towards the stern of the ship than towards the bow. Angling towards the enemy in such a way that the ship fires towards the stern is worth considering, especially since this also exposes the bow ammunition magazine less.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
