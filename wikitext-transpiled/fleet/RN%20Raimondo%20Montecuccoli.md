== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]].

Raimondo Montecuccoli was the namesake of the subclass of the [[Condottieri (Family)|Condottieri]] cruisers. She was laid down in October 1931 and commissioned in June 1935, marking a major shift for the class, becoming a proper cruiser instead of a destroyer-hunter. To fulfill the goal, designers doubled the mass committed to the armour, upgraded boilers and increased the anti-air armament.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
[[File:RN Raimondo Montecuccoli Armor.jpg|thumb|Overview of the protection scheme]]
With 578 crew members, and an armour belt of 60 mm, the Raimondo Montecuccoli boasts one of the most reliable hulls for taking damage from the front. 25 mm of steel armour also surrounds the ship alongside the forward fuel tanks, allow the ship to take prolonged fire while leaving its crew and modules protected. However when approached from the side the decent 60 mm armour belt turns into a downside, as it is easily penetrated by lower ranked vessels such as the [[Sumner (DD-692)|Sumner]]. The rear ammo rack is particularly easy to destroy because of its location at the water line, and the lack of modules around it to absorb damage.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility}}

The Montecuccoli is tied with the Attilio Regolo as the fastest cruiser at 72 km/h forward, while also boasting a high reverse speed of 32 km/h, while the Regolo can only reach a top speed of 26 km/h in reverse. This high speed allows the Montecuccoli to dominate maps where it can push capture points or switch objectives quickly when needed.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|152/53 mm O.T.O. Mod.1929 (152 mm)}}

The Montecuccoli is equipped with 8 dual-mounted 152/53 mm O.T.O Mod.1929 cannons. This armament is divided between both sides of the ship allowing for good firing angles. The best round for the ship is the APHEBC Palla with a penetration of 282 mm at 1,000 m and an explosive mass of 800 g. This shell allows the Montecuccoli to reliably frontally penetrate other ships' bows to damage modules and ammunition racks when being pushed. As backup rounds the ship also carries two HE rounds labelled HE Dirompente with 29 mm of penetration at any range or angle with an explosive mass of 2.39 kg, but the HE-TF round is also given a time fuse allowing it to be more versatile. Because of the precarious ammunition rack location along the waterline, it is recommended to bring around 500 rounds of APHEBC for the primary round, and around 250 rounds of HE-TF to be used against smaller boats and aircraft.

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|100 mm/47 O.T.O. Mod. 1928 (100 mm)}}

Equipped with 6 dual-mounted 100 mm/47 O.T.O Mod. 1928 cannons, the Montecuccoli is blessed with reliable secondary armament to be used when the primary armament is disabled. When used aggressively, it is suggested to load primarily the APHE round because of its 150 mm of penetration at 100 m, and its 820 g explosive mass. This shell is reliable to disable the main turrets on other cruisers. However the HE-TF Contro-aerea is also useful as an anti-aircraft shell, as well as using its 17 mm of penetration at any angle to deliver 1.3 kg of explosive mass to smaller PT boats.

{{:100 mm/47 O.T.O. Mod. 1928 (100 mm)/Ammunition|100 mm HE Dirompente, 100 mm APHE Perforante, 100 mm HE-TF Contro-aerea}}

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|37 mm/54 Breda Mod.38 (37 mm)|20 mm/70 Oerlikon 3S (20 mm)}}

The Montecuccoli is adequately protected from aircraft by 8 dual-mounted 37 mm/54 Breda Mod.38 autocannons, and 10 single-mounted 20 mm/70 Oerlikon 3S autocannons. In conjunction with the secondary armament, the AI will have no trouble removing smaller targets during a battle leaving the player safe to engage larger targets with the primary armament.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo M (533 mm)|B TG depth charge}}

Graced with 533 mm steam-turbined S.I. 270/533,4X7,2 Tipo M torpedoes in dual mounts along the sides of the main funnel, the Montecuccoli can achieve excellent firing angles for these torpedoes while also leaving them protected while charging an enemy. With torpedo mode enabled, the torpedoes travel 12 km with a speed of 56 km/h, while disabled the torpedo travels 4 km at a speed of 93 km/h. Because of the low amount of torpedoes (4 total), it is recommended to disable the torpedo mode as it allows the ship to more reliably aim the torpedoes while brawling.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships is a catapult with one Ro.43 scout plane which provides unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. The Ro.43 is a 2-seater equipped with two fixed offensive light machine guns and a single defensive machine gun turret, but no bombs. It does have the scout plane ability to cap zones and lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilise the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new!

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Raimondo Montecuccoli is second only to the Admiral Graf Spee in its ability to absorb damage using its bow's large size, and lack of modules, allowing the ship to safely charge objectives or enemies. In addition to its high speed and excellent firing angles on the 4 torpedoes, it is best recommended to point the bow of the ship towards an enemy and close into the 4 km range of the torpedoes to get reliable kills on other cruisers that can't react to the positioning the Montecuccoli can achieve. This strategy works best against ships such as the [[Admiral Hipper]], and [[Sverdlov]]. These ships lack the firepower to reliably disable the Montecuccoli, or adequately avoid the excellent torpedo spread the Montecuccoli can use. While this is the most enjoyable usage of the Montecuccoli, it isn't reliable for sustained gameplay as the ship can easily be flanked and destroyed after reaching the enemy lines. Ships such as the Admiral Graf Spee, Brooklyn, and Mogami can also counter this playstyle by using their excellent guns to penetrate the excellent bow protection to destroy the Montecuccoli. An alternative usage is as a stationary sniper after reaching an unexpected location by using its high speed. This playstyle eliminates the flanking threat, but limits the effectiveness of the guns and torpedoes.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Raimondo Montecuccoli was designed in the third group of Condottieri-class light cruisers by Ansaldo, and Genoa. Named after the 17th century Italian general Raimondo Montecuccoli, the cruiser was involved in battles such as the Battle of Punta Stilo, and convoy attacks during the Battle of Pantelleria. The ship eventually ended surviving the war and acting as a training cruiser until 1961.
