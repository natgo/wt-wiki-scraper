The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Leone-class destroyer built for the Regia Marina between 1917-1924. The class consisted of 5 ordered destroyers, out of which two were cancelled and only three were made. Tigre was last to be laid down on 23rd January 1922, and launched on 10th October 1924. The initial designation of the Leone-class was scout cruiser, but they were later re-designated as destroyers. They were armed with four twin 120 mm Schneider-Canet-Armstrong 1918/19 guns and two single 76 mm Ansaldo 76/40 Model 1916 guns for anti-aircraft duty. Two triple 450 mm torpedo launchers were fitted amidships. The Leone-class were deployed to Italian East Africa at the naval base in Massawa, Eritrea. Tigre saw very little action and together with her sisters, that were either sunk or scuttled, ended up being scuttled off the coast of Arabia by her own crew on 3rd April 1941 after being pursued by British aircraft.

Introduced in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]], RN Tigre is an Italian premium destroyer. Being a WWI design, she is very lacklustre when compared to other ships on same battle rating. Her torpedoes are quite fast with average payload but very limited range of 4 km which make their use very situational. The main armament is also unique in that the ship has access to APHE rounds unlike any other destroyer armed with calibres smaller than 150 mm. However, the rate of fire of 7 rounds per minute is lower than contemporaries. The magazines of the ship are located above the waterline right under the turrets, making it very vulnerable to fatal detonation.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Tigre has almost no armour to speak of besides the 4 mm steel superstructure, the 16 mm steel hull and the 12 mm thick anti-fragmentation armour on gun shields, the important thing is to flank enemies rather than rush them if you want to stay alive, while as a crew you have 206 men to sustain an adequate amount of damage caused by other ships.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The speed of the RN Tigre is reasonable though not especially fast, she does reach her top speed of 63 km/h very quickly with his acceleration, but for manoeuvrability, like almost all Italian ships, it is very good and allows you to dodge torpedoes, enemy salvoes and obstacles at the last moment.

{{main|120 mm/45 Canet-Schneider-Armstrong mod.1918-19 (120 mm)}}

The RN Tigre has a heavy gun armament (for a destroyer) of eight 120/45 Canet-Schneider-Armstrong Mod. 1918/19 main guns. These fire the same shells as the 120/45 OTO Mod. 1926 guns on the Italian reserve destroyer [[RN Turbine|Turbine]] and have generally identical performance to them as well. They are distributed in four twin mounts, one in the bow, one in the stern, and the other two amidships. Three of these mounts have unlimited traverse, but the one sited between the funnels cannot be traversed fully because of the fore funnel blocking the guns. The guns have a fairly low rate of fire of only 7 rounds/minute maximum with an aced crew.

The 120 mm guns fire HE, HE-DF, and APHE shells. The HE (and identical HE-DF) shells have a large filler for a 120 mm shell at 2.39 kg of TNT, which is significantly more than those of the newer 120 mm HE shells used by the [[Dardo]] and Corazziere and even the larger 135 mm HE shells of the [[RN Comandante Margottini|Comandante Margottini]], [[RN Attilio Regolo|Attilio Regolo]], and [[RN Etna|Etna]]. However, her APHE has less filler than the APHE on those other ships. HE-DF explodes at the range set by the rangefinder, primarily for anti-aircraft usage, but the limited gun elevation makes the main guns quite hard to use in the anti-aircraft role.

{{main|76 mm/40 Ansaldo mod.1917 (76 mm)}}

The Secondary armament is composed by Two 76 mm/40 Ansaldo mod.1917, these two cannons are positioned by one mount in both sides and this is the armament difference between RN Tigre and RN Leone (2x Twin 13,2mm), in addition to this these cannons are perfect for the anti-aircraft role using the HE-TF thanks to the option to choose targets with AI these cannons become really lethal against air targets, while for more anti-ship role I recommend using the APHE which allow you to damage both small boats and ships where in the small boats you can shoot anywhere and cause heavy damage while if you are against ships such as destroyers and light cruisers you have to shoot in the area of the engines to cause as much damage as possible.

If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|40 mm/39 Vickers-Terni mod.1915/1917, Modif.1930 (40 mm)}}

The AA armament is composed by two 40mm/39 Vickers-Terni mod.1915/1917, Modif.1930 (40mm), these 40mm cannons are more specific for anti-aircraft role but they still struggle to hit the enemy target even if they have HE-TFs but when they hit the enemy aircraft due to the framentation of the shot it causes the destruction of the aircraft, I strongly advise against using them against small naval targets in automatic because it already causes little damage and then the enemy boat might be armoured.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I. 250/533,4X7,5 Tipo A (533 mm)}}The only additional armament that the RN Tigre carries are 4 S.I. 250/533.4X7.5 Type A Torpedoes, which have enough explosives to damage or destroy enemy ships except Battlecruisers and Battleships in one hit, using the torpedo modification you can increase torpedo range but lose torpedo speed, always try to target the holds in enemy ships which are almost always under the main towers.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The RN Tigre for a destroyer can carry only 4 torpedoes less than other italian destroyers but the strong part are his heavier main gun armament. With a large salvo of eight fairly powerful HE shells, she can deal a substantial amount of damage to opposing destroyers with a single salvo. However, the low rate of fire of the main guns also mean that she cannot really compete in a prolonged duel against fast-firing destroyers (particular the American ones with 5"/38 main guns) for example British destroyers (HMS Diana, HMS Nepal...) and American Destroyers (USS Fletcher, USS Mitscher...), and last  and despite her larger size she actually has a smaller crew count than the RN Corazziere and [[RN Da Verazzano]]. Furthermore, her partially exposed bow ammunition magazine is a dangerous weakness, especially in close range fights.

Her torpedo armament is very poor, with only four fairly underwhelming 533 mm torpedoes that are not particularly fast and that have a very short range of only 4 km without the torpedo mode installed. It is worth considering not bringing them at all, especially since they are a potential hazard if hit by enemy fire.

It is also worth noting that the RN Tigre has better firing angles towards the stern of the ship than towards the bow. Angling towards the enemy in such a way that the ship fires towards the stern is worth considering, especially since this also exposes the bow ammunition magazine less.

At last for the additional two 76mm cannons, the best option to use them is for anti-air role with HE-TF, if you want to use them against other ships use the APHE because HE for the 76mm are very weak and don't do very much damage to the enemy ships and boats.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Large number of main guns
* Large main gun HE shell explosive filler
* Large field-of-fire towards the stern of the ship
* Reasonable penetration and filler for the APHE shell
* Two 76mm cannons more than RN Leone

'''Cons:'''

* Low main gun rate of fire
* Inadequate anti-aircraft armament
* Only four torpedoes with a very short range without torpedo mode installed
* Above-waterline bow ammunition magazine

=== Devblog History ===
The Italian Leone-class destroyers were ordered to replace the more obsolete and worn out ships of the Regia Marina. Ansaldo shipbuilding company, that developed the design of the new ships, focussed at developing the concept of the previous class of ships of this type - the Carlo Mirabello scout cruisers - combining significant firepower with high speed performance. In the period of 1921-1922 three destroyers, out of five ships ordered, were built at the Italian shipyards and all three received the names of large felines: Leone, Tigre and Pantera. After 15 years of service in the native waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the feline flotilla was sent to serve at the Massawa naval base in the Red Sea, where the ships met the entry of Italy into World War II ... cut off from the main forces of the fleet.

By this time, the destroyers were already worn out from time and tropical climate. After several unsuccessful attacks on enemy convoys, the destroyers opted for a suicidal mission to the harbor of Suez, Leone wrecked herself on an unmarked rock and, as a result of the damage received, was flooded by the wakes of the two remaining destroyers. No less desperate was the second attack, the target of which was the port of Sudan - this time the ships being assaulted by fierce raids from British aircraft, were forced to retreat into neutral waters where the crews scuttled the doomed ships in shallow waters off the Arabian coast. The partially submerged ships were soon reconnoitered and finally destroyed by air strikes and artillery from the destroyer HMS Kingston.
