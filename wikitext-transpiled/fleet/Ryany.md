== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a [[Pr.7 (Family)|Gnevny-class]] destroyer built for the Soviet Navy in the 1930s. The Gnevny class was a license-built version of the Italian Folgore class, inheriting the stability issues due to the Soviet design being heavier than the original. She was initially laid down in Nikolayev shipyards on 31st December 1935, before being shipped by rail to Vladivostok where she was laid down again on 18th September 1936. She was commissioned on 11th August 1939 and assigned to the Pacific Fleet. Her career was uneventful, and she was reclassified as a target ship in 1958 before being sunk as a target on 8th January 1961.

The Ryany was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a GE premium ship. As the main armament of all Project 7 destroyers is manually driven, the turrets suffer from poor traverse speed rendering these difficult when switching targets. The guns themselves are also protected only by 8 mm thick antifragmentation armour covering sides, front and top side. As with most destroyers from other navies as well, Gnevny-class features unarmoured magazines above the waterline, which will lead to fatal explosion when hit. Her boilers and transmission also take up nearly the entire length of the ship past the bridge. Being hit in these spaces will damage or disable the machinery, leaving the ship dead in the water.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Be mindful that the turrets have poor traverse speed making it difficult when switching targets. The guns itself are only protected with 8 mm of anti-fragmentation armor. It has unarmored magazines that are above the waterline, that when hit will cause a fatal explosion. The boilers and transmission take up almost everything  past the bridge to the stern. Making it easy to lose propulsion to enemy fire and becoming floating hulk worthy of Warhammer 40k Orks to use in their Wargs.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
