== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The S-38b is nearly identical to the [[S-38]] in terms of survivability. The S-38b has the same hull construction and composition, yet the bridge is constructed of 10 mm thick anti-fragmentation armour. This means the bridge is more resilient to damage on the S-38b than S-38.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The S-38b is quick and agile.. It is also nearly identical to the [[S-38]] in terms of mobility: the difference is that the S-38b is slightly quicker forwards at 106 km/h (66 mph).

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|2 cm/65 C/30 (20 mm)|2 cm/65 C/38 (20 mm)}}

While good but not excellent, the 20 mm cannons are capable guns for shredding lightly armoured boats and low-flying aircraft. However, the short clip capacity tends to be an issue. While using this guns, the aiming must be really accurate. Being lightweight guns, the turning speed and aiming speed are very fast and accurate. This should be used as an advantage as this reduces the risk of being flanked and surprised attacked by enemy boats and aircraft.

There are three ammunition types available:

* '''Universal:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF|High-explosive fragmentation}}

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|MG34 (7.92 mm)}}

The main difference between the S-38 and the S-38b is the presence of MG34 machine guns. These machine guns are more suited towards firing upon aircraft instead of ships; citing their meagre calibre. The machine guns are mounted behind the bridge and are initially aimed upwards. The location of these machine guns allows them to fire on either side of the ship, and fire upon aircraft.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|G7a (533 mm)|WBD depth charge}}

The S-38b is armed with two torpedoes that have a max range of 6 km (14 km with torpedo mode). They can be used almost at point-blank, the torpedoes must travel 50 m at minimum to be armed (most of the time "point blank" engagements will be between 100-500 m). Depending on the map, game mode and captain's discretion, the torpedo depth can be adjusted in order to target specific ships.

'''1 meter depth:'''

This is the most universal depth used for all types of engagements, being in deep water or at shallow waters. This depth is capable of hitting all sorts of vessels, including PT boats. The main downside is that enemy ships can see the water trail made by the torpedo which can make enemy vessels evade or fire at the torpedo.

'''4 meter depth:'''

This is the recommended depth when trying to perform long range sneaky engagements of large ships in deep waters. This is one of the riskier techniques as there is no way to launch them in shallow waters (most shallow water maps have water depth of 2-3 m). Only the captain and the team will be able to see the torpedo symbol while travelling close to them, and it will not leave any visible water trail compared to the 1-meter depth torpedo.

The S-38b can be armed with WBD depth charges. It is not recommended to load them in the ship as they do not have any practical use in-game besides being a last resort weapon.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The S-38b has a similar playstyle to the S-38: a fast, agile, lightly-armoured but well-armed craft. The main purpose of this vessel is to rush capture points and support other boats. This ship should never face enemies alone due to its light armour that can be easily penetrated by the guns seen at the battle rating, specially the 3-in guns mounted on American and British sub-chasers. Instead, the S-38b should travel with other ships, essentially making the enemy engage in a single target while being engaged by 2-3 or more.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very close to the S-38, one can switch from the S-38 with no special learning required
* Very mobile
* Cannons offer effective stopping power for single target engagements
* Torpedoes are very viable in combat, as they are mounted conveniently and deal significant damage
* Inexpensive to operate
* Good crew size

'''Cons:'''

* Hull offers minimal protection
* Key components are close together (ammo is near engines, radio room is near the bridge), meaning enemy fire will quickly tear it apart
* Cannons have limited capacity per magazine
* Does not do well in numerical inferiority
* Even with additional MG 34s, anti-air coverage is minimal
* The speed is not very fast

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

S-38b was a subclass of [[S-38]] class Schnellboots (S-boots), these being later production ships. The S-38b class added an armoured bridge to the design due to the lack of protection for the bridge on the original S-38 class. It was known as the Kalotte (Eng: skull cap) because of its round shape. The S-38b class was eventually equipped with more powerful Daimler Benz MB 501 diesel engines, increasing the maximum speed.
