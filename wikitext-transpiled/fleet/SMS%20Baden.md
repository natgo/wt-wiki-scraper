== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German battleship {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7796-event-summer-quest-en|2024 "Imperial Flagship" event]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

SMS Baden became the second and last ship built in a series of the most powerful battleships in the history of the Imperial German Navy. This ship was launched at the end of October 1915 and entered service a year later in October 1916. Becoming the flagship of the High Seas Fleet, Baden was transferred to Kiel to prevent the allied forces from breaking through into the Baltic Sea. In 1918, part of the crew of Baden joined the Kiel anti-war uprising. In 1919, along with other ships of the High Seas Fleet, she was transferred to the Scapa Flow for internment, where commanders of the fleet received orders to scuttle ships in this area. Despite this, Baden’s crew failed to cause enough critical damage, causing her to be captured by the British. In August 1921, Baden was destroyed as a target ship by gunnery practice from the Royal Navy.
