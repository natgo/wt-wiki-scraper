== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the lead ship of the Bayern-class dreadnoughts of the Kaiserliche Marine. She had one sister, Baden, while the other two ordered ships ([[SMS Sachsen|Sachsen]] and Württemberg) were cancelled. She was laid down on 22nd December 1913 and commissioned on 15th July 1916. She saw very limited service during her career. Her most notable action was in September 1917 during Operation Albion where she, together with four König- and five Kaiser-class battleships, participated in seizing the Baltic island of Ösel (Saaremaa). During the operation, Bayern struck a mine and had to withdraw to Kiel to undergo repairs. Meanwhile, König and Kronprinz engaged the Russian pre-dreadnought battleship Slava and sunk it. After the German surrender, Bayern was to be handed over to the British. She was scuttled by her crew and sunk at Scapa Flow together with the majority of the German High Seas Fleet.

The Bayern was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]]. She boasts powerful 38 cm guns paired with an only 26-second reload which is faster than most dreadnoughts with smaller calibre guns. The ship itself is very well-protected, though caution is advised when the armour plates covering the magazines at the waterline are destroyed as this can lead to fatal magazine explosion. The coal bunkers behind the armour belt also further enhance the magazine protection. As the Bayern is a WWI-era ship, she is vulnerable to air attacks as she possesses very limited anti-air weaponry.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|88 mm/45 AA SK L/45 (88 mm)}}

Like many other WWI-era battleships the anti-aircraft suite on the Bayern is very lacking. With only 2 x 88 mm cannons, one on the right and left side located near the centre of the ship, the Bayern will struggle to defend itself from enemy aircraft. The reload on these weapons in somewhat decent allowing for a semi-sustained rate of fire. If a shot lands on an enemy aircraft, the 88 mm shell will almost always take it out of the sky.

With such a small amount of anti-aircraft weapons, their effectiveness against enemy ships will be negligible. It is not recommended to repair these while fighting other ships if they are damaged due to their minimal firepower.

Overall, the anti-aircraft armament on the Bayern is mediocre and matches the poor effectiveness of most other WWI-era battleships.

=== Additional armament ===

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Strong belt armour
* Manoeuvrable: good acceleration and deceleration

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely weak deck armour, only two layers of 30 mm armour plate
* Mediocre main gun: SAP loses penetration over distance drastically, and APC has less than 600 mm penetration
* Main gun ammunition is stored together with auxiliary gun ammunition; they are prone to fire hazard and chain detonation
* Crew compartments and boilers/transmission are not separated by internal structural armour. Fire will spread and cause severe damage

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
