'''SMS Derfflinger''' was a German battlecruiser laid down in March 1911, commissioned during the First World War on 1 September 1914. Her first action was participation in the raid on Hartlepool, Scarborough, and Whitby in December 1914. She then fought at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915. Finally, Derfflinger was also present at the Battle of Jutland from 31 May to 1 June 1916, where she engaged in the destruction of HMS Queen Mary and HMS Invincible, as well as damaged HMS Princess Royal and HMS Barham; however, she sustained significant damage herself. After repairs and a refit that included the installation of a tripod foremast, she returned to service on 15 October 1916. In October 1918, plans for a final naval operation included Derfflinger, but it was cancelled due to unrest among the crews. Following the Armistice, she was interned at Scapa Flow in November 1918 and was scuttled by her crew on 21 June 1919. Raised in late August 1939, she was towed to Faslane after the Second World War and scrapped there between 1946 and 1948.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a German battlecruiser introduced in [[Update "Dance of Dragons"]]. She features good mobility and good armour for a battlecruiser, while also sharing main guns with German battleships of the same BR, which give her formidable firepower, although with a lower number of individual cannons than most of her peers. Finally, her anti-air armament is extremely poor, making her an easy target for even large, slow-flying, four-engine bombers or even coastal vessels from reserve BRs, if they manage to avoid the 150 mm casemate guns.

'''SMS Derfflinger''' was a German battlecruiser laid down in March 1911 at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg. As part of the Imperial German Navy's expansion, she was designed with improved armour and armament to counter British naval power. Her comissioning took place on 1 September 1914, just 65 days after the beginning of the Great War.

On 16 December 1914, Derfflinger took part in the raid on the British coastal towns of Hartlepool, Scarborough, and Whitby. Alongside other German battlecruisers, she bombarded settlement, causing damage and a number of civilian casualties. The operation aimed to lure portions of the British Grand Fleet into engagements favourable to the Germans. Derfflinger also saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915, where she engaged British battlecruisers and sustained minor damage.

During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May to 1 June 1916, SMS Derfflinger served as part of the German I Scouting Group (1. SG). Early in the engagement, at 15:49, Derfflinger scored two hits on the British battlecruiser HMS Princess Royal. At 16:21, she, along with SMS Seydlitz, targeted [[HMS Queen Mary]], contributing to damage that led to Queen Mary's magazine explosion and sinking at 16:26, with the loss of all but twenty of her crew.

Around 17:00, Derfflinger hit the British battleship [[HMS Barham]] four times. Shortly after, at 17:19, she was struck on the forecastle by a shell from the British 5th Battle Squadron, causing damage, a fire, and flooding in the bow area. She sustained additional hits around 17:55, possibly two shells simultaneously, leading to further flooding. Between 18:26 and 18:30, Derfflinger was hit three times by HMS Indomitable, resulting in leaks and necessitating a brief stop to prevent her propellers from being fouled.

Later in the battle, at 18:32, Derfflinger, alongside SMS Lützow, engaged [[HMS Invincible]], which exploded and sank. From 19:14 to 19:25, while leading the German battlecruisers, Derfflinger came under concentrated fire from the British fleet. She was hit fourteen times, suffering severe damage including the destruction of her aft turrets due to propellant fires and significant flooding from multiple shell impacts. Despite the damage, she was able to withdraw with the fleet. Following the battle, she underwent extensive repairs, during which she was fitted with a tripod foremast to enhance her fire-control capabilities, returning to service on 15 October 1916.

In late October 1918, plans for a final naval operation involving Derfflinger were cancelled due to unrest and mutiny among German naval crews. Following Germany's defeat, she was interned at Scapa Flow in November 1918. On 21 June 1919, Derfflinger was scuttled by her crew to prevent her seizure by the Allies. Raised in late August 1939, her scrapping was delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War. Eventually, she was towed to Faslane in Scotland and broken up between 1946 and 1948.
