== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German battleship {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
This Helgoland-class dreadnought comes with a thick side armoured belt of 300 mm, and other places being 90 to 170 mm thick. This can stop 356 mm HE rounds except at the higher sections of the bow and stern.

All 6 turrets have thick barbettes, which AP shells have to go through after the already thick side armour.

Ammunition is surrounded by coal bunkers, in addition to a turtle-back armour scheme.

In short: she is one of the toughest battleships in the game, as long as she faces fair opponents.

To survive longer, do not repair secondary battery. Doing so will remove crew from your armoured hull and put it in the vulnerable secondary turrets, for them to be killed again.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility}}

Being a dreadnought, it was all about armour and firepower. She will reach a little bit over 38 km/h maxed out.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|305 mm/50 SK L/50 (305 mm)}}

Her primary armament is somewhat lacking for her size. She has 6 turrets, but only 4 can fire at a broadside. 3 can fire most of the time and worst case scenario only 2 will fire.

Her turrets have each double 305 mm guns, this is somewhat lacking for long range fights.

{{:305 mm/50 SK L/50 (305 mm)/Ammunition|305 mm Spgr. L/3.8 Bdz, 305 mm Spgr. L/3.3 SAP, 305 mm Psgr. L/3.4}}

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|150 mm/45 SK L/45 (150 mm)|88 mm/45 casemate SK L/45 (88 mm)}}

While her primary armament is lacking, she makes it up with great secondaries.

She has fourteen 150 mm guns in casemates all around the ship, and fourteen 88 mm guns with fragmentation shells. Torpedo boats will not like getting close to you.

Even her 150 mm are a real threat to any destroyers, even light cruisers.

{{:150 mm/45 SK L/45 (150 mm)/Ammunition|150 mm Sprgr. L/4.1 Kz, 150 mm Sprgr. L/4.1 Bdz, 150 mm Psgr. L/3.7}}

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|G6c (500 mm)}}

She comes with fixed underwater torpedo tubes. Being an old ship, her torpedoes are not remotely good.

She carries a total of sixteen torpedoes, in several launchers: 1 forward, 1 rear, 2+2 per broadside.

Her torpedoes carry only 160 kg of TNT, which may not be enough to break through the torpedo bulges of other dreadnoughts and heavy cruisers. This means that several hits are needed.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Massive firepower, primary and secondary
* Heavily armoured, making it hard to sink

'''Cons:'''

* Has no anti-air defences
* Is very slow
* 305 mm may have difficulties destroying other dreadnoughts from afar

[[File:SMS Helgoland.jpg|thumb|SMS Helgoland, Circa 1911-1917.]]
SMS ''Helgoland'' was the lead ship of the ''Helgoland''-class of pre-WWI dreadnought battleships. Being an incremental improvement upon the preceding [[SMS Westfalen|''Nassau'']]-class battleships, they featured a more powerful 12-inch (305 mm) battery and improved propulsion system. Built in 1909, she saw service in World War 1; she served in the raid on Scarborough, Battle of Riga, and Battle of Jutland. After the war, ''Helgoland'' was handed to the United Kingdom as a war reparation; she was scrapped in 1924.<ref name=":0">World War 1 Co. (1998)</ref><ref name=":1">Military Factory. (2020)</ref>

=== Design and construction ===
The ''Helgoland''-class was of overall similar construction to the preceding ''Nassau''-class. They displaced 22,500 tons standard, and with 28,000 shaft horsepower, were capable of making 20 knots (37 km/h).<ref name=":0" /> The ''Helgoland'' featured a unique hexagonal main armament arrangement, similar to the ''Nassau''-class, but had a higher-calibre main battery of twelve 12-inch (305 mm) guns in six twin-turrets.<ref name=":0" /> The ''Helgoland'' also carried numerous 5.9-inch (150 mm) guns and 88 mm guns in casemate mountings.<ref name=":0" /> She later gained four 88 mm high-angle anti-aircraft weapons, but this is not reflected in the game. As a result, the 1911 ''Helgoland'' didn't have any anti-aircraft protection. Finally, the ''Helgoland'' carried six 50 cm torpedo tubes mounted underneath the waterline.<ref name=":0" />

The ''Helgoland'' was laid down in November of 1908, named after the Heligoland archipelago in the North Sea.<ref name=":1" /> She was launched in September of 1909. She was completed and commissioned on August 23rd 1911, after the completion of three years of construction.<ref name=":0" />

=== Operational history ===
The Helgoland entered service with the German 1st Battle Squadron, which formed the core of the German battleship strike force.<ref name=":1" /> She participated in some training exercises before the war, along with her sister ships. After the start of the First World War, Helgoland saw her first combat action at the Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. Due to heavy fog, the British and German forces never directly engaged despite the fact that ''Helgoland'' was at one point just 10 nautical miles away from the British fleet. ''Helgoland'' later participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, though she failed to see major combat action.

''Helgoland'' participated in the Battle of Jutland, where she was located at the centre of the German battleship line. As a result, she saw less action than ships at the front of the formation, such as the battleship ''Konig''. Despite this, ''Helgoland'' still fired 63 12-inch shells, and took a hit from a 15-inch shell that caused a moderate amount of flooding.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> The battle of Jutland was a tactical victory for the German fleet, having lost less ships and men than the British. However, it was a strategic victory for the British as the German grand fleet would never set sail in large numbers again.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

''Helgoland'', along with her sister ships, were docked at Wilhelmshaven until the end of the war; she was supposed to participate in the suicidal German raid against the British fleet, in an attempt to secure better surrendering conditions.<ref name=":1" /> However, this failed as the sailors manning the ship mutinied.<ref name=":1" /> Thus, ''Helgoland'' was handed to the British as a war reparation, along with her three sister ships. She was eventually scrapped by 1924.<ref name=":1" />
