== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German battleship {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Drone Age"]] as a reward for the 2022 [[wt:en/news/7882-event-project-overpowered-en|Project "Overpowered"]] event.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very good protection
* Great firepower

'''Cons:'''

* Bad anti-air capabilities
* Lacklustre torpedoes
* Poor manoeuvrability

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
SMS Ostfriesland was the second ship of the Helgoland class of dreadnought battleships within the Imperial German Navy. Honouring the East Frisia locale, construction of Ostfriesland commenced in October 1908 at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven. The vessel was officially christened on 30 September 1909 and entered active service on 1 August 1911.

Together with her three sibling vessels, [[SMS Helgoland|Helgoland]], Thüringen, and Oldenburg, Ostfriesland took part in all significant fleet manoeuvres of World War I in the North Sea, engaging the British Grand Fleet. Notably, she played a pivotal role in the Battle of Jutland from 31 May to 1 June 1916, marked as the most extensive naval confrontation of the conflict. Additionally, the ship actively participated in Baltic Sea operations against the Russian Navy, notably contributing to the initial unsuccessful incursion into the Gulf of Riga in August 1915.
