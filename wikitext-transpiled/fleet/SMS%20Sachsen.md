== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a German Kaiserliche Marine Bayern-class battleship. The Sachsen is sometimes considered a sub-class of a Bayern-class as unlike [[SMS Bayern|Bayern]] and Baden, the Sachsen had a longer hull by two metres and two coal-powered turbines with a single diesel engine. Sachsen was laid down on 15th April 1914 and her construction was never finished due to resources needed for her completion being shifted towards building of new U-boats as these were considered more effective against the Allies. She was nine months before completion when the work stopped in 1916. Due to the Treaty of Versailles, her hull had to be scrapped. She was sold for scrap in 1920 and subsequently broken up.

The Sachsen was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. She boasts a powerful 38 cm guns paired with an only 26-second reload, which is faster than most dreadnoughts with smaller calibre guns. The ship itself is very well-protected, though caution is advised when the armour plates covering the magazines at the waterline are destroyed as this can lead to fatal magazine explosion. The coal bunkers behind the armour belt also further enhance the magazine protection. As the Sachsen is a WWI-era ship, she is vulnerable to air attacks as she possesses very limited anti-air weaponry.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
