== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (also known as the '''AB-4''') was the first production model Soukou-Tei/AB-Tei which was ready by 1933. After the successful operations of the earlier [[Soukou-Tei (1927)|AB-1 'Sakigake']] and AB-2 'Kachidoki', the armament was updated with Japan's newest equipment switching the machine guns to dual 7.7 mm instead of 6.5 mm and upgrading the [[Type 11 pattern 1922 (37 mm)|37 mm Type 11 infantry gun]] to the [[Type 97 (57 mm)|57 mm ''Type 97'' tank gun]]. The armour was more efficiently welded which provided the same or better armour values with reduced weight which, along with the conversion to a diesel engine, also allowed it to reach higher speeds than its predecessors.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]]. The AB-4 plays similarly to its earlier prototype the [[Soukou-Tei (1927)|AB-1 'Sakigake']] but is improved in all departments. The AB-4 has better performance, mobility, and firepower than its predecessor, but it still suffers from the limitations of its design for open sea combat. The AB-4 is equipped with two [[Type 89 'special' (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm ''Type 89'' 'special' machine guns]] in dual mounts and a [[Type 97 (57 mm)|57 mm ''Type 97'' tank gun]] that is also used on the [[I-Go Ko|I-Go]] and [[Chi-Ha]]. The AB-4 can operate more independently than the AB-1, but it may still benefit from the assistance of other vessels for towing or escorting. The 7.7 mm machine guns can deal considerable damage to lightly armoured targets, such as patrol boats and aircraft, but have limited range. The 57 mm tank gun can deal excellent damage, but it has accuracy and velocity issues that make it difficult to hit fast-moving or distant enemies.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The Soukou-Tei No.4 is likely the first truly armoured boat you'll be unlocking in the tech tree- although not by a huge margin. The superstructure is protected by 7 mm of RHA, while the hull is protected by 4 mm of RHA. At a few hundred metres this will make you immune from 7.7 mm machine gun fire, but everything else can still penetrate this boats armour. at range some heavy machine gun rounds may fail to penetrate as some of the armour will be angled, but in any case it's not something to rely on.{{clear}}

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The Soukou-Tei No.4 like the previous boat is very very slow, it can reach exactly the same speed as the Model 1927 (26km/h in RB modes and 35 km/h in AB modes), making it one of the slowest vessels around its battle rating. This can make playing it fairly tedious as it will take a fairly long time to advance to combat ranges on most maps. Its mobility and ability to turn is about as you'd expect, not standout but not terrible, it will lose a lot of speed when turning hard though so be aware of this if you're taking fire.{{clear}}

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
[[File:Chi-Ha + Soukou-Tei (1940).png|thumb|506x506px|The Soukou-Tei and Chi-Ha sharing the same 57 mm Type 97 tank gun ]]
{{main|Type 97 (57 mm)}}

This boat is equipped with the 57 mm Type 97 tank gun, which is functionally very similar to that found on the I-Go Ko and Chi-Ha tanks, though it has some slight ballistic differences. For the Soukou-Tei though it's a fairly underwhelming weapon. It will do significant damage to smaller boats when the shot lands but landing a shot is the hardest part. It comes with three different rounds:

* HE - Decent damage output over a fairly wide area
* HEAT - Decent damage output over a condensed area, slightly lower velocity
* APHE - Very little damage potential

Overall the stock HE round is the most consistent, it deals a fairly effective amount of damage, and will black out compartments on smaller boats with a single hit. The HEAT contains a lot of explosive filler, but it doesn't spread damage over a wide area, and it's fairly ineffective when compared to the HE, it does have some viability against more armoured vessels though. The APHE is close to useless functionally, it only has slightly more penetration power than the HE and contains less than half the explosive filler, the HEAT will be a better option against armoured targets.{{clear}}

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
[[File:Soukou-Tei (1940) type 89 'special'.png|left|thumb|444x444px|7.7 mm Type 89 Special machine gun]]
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 89 (7.7 mm)}}

The Soukou-Tei is also equipped with two twin 7.7 mm turrets. They have very little damage potential against enemy ships unless engaging at very close range. They come with three belts-

* Universal - A mix between armour piecing and incendiary tracer rounds
* AP - Majority armour piercing
* API - Majority incendiary tracer

Overall the incendiary tracer rounds do the most consistent damage overall to vessels and aircraft, the damage itself is fairly poor, but if you are in a situation where you find yourself needing to use these guns, the API belt is the way to go. Unlike the previous Soukou-Tei model the turrets on this variant have double the elevation, meaning than can be used more effectively against aircraft, a good burst will knock one out.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This vessel's playstyle is very very similar to the previous model, the 1927- and in much the same vein, because of all the various drawbacks this vessel has, it's hard to pinpoint a truly effective way to play it, as it just does not excel in any capacity. A safe, and arguably effective way to play it is by using it as an escort for some of the larger ships on your team, this works in theory, but in practice a lot of the large support vessels around this battle rating are almost twice as fast as you, so you'll likely be left lagging behind the group.

In any case though aiming to stay close to friendlies is the best way to keep yourself afloat, you can't take much fire, so you'll need a buffer from your team to help you out, in a one on one engagement you'll likely lose, as you just don't have the accuracy to be able to quickly sink enemy boats at long or close range. You can however, aid some of the larger ships in sinking enemy boats, try to aim for the same targets as your team to contribute to knocking them out. The 57 mm is a fairly damaging weapon, so aim to take out the compartments of the enemy boats you come across, the fire rate isn't terrible, and if you have the range you can finish off an enemy boat in 3 or 4 good hits. Even though this boat is an upgrade firepower wise from the Model 1927, being more aggressive and fighting one on one is still a largely inconsistent tactic, and you should still aim to support your friendlies.

Because most if not all friendly vessels will outpace you, try to aim to reach some cover around some commonly traveled areas of the map first, and then team up with any large friendly ships that come close to you afterwards, this allows for you to stay relatively safe for as long as possible. Try not to stray too far from cover or friendlies, you can't reliably engage past 1,000 m anyway, and if an enemy starts engaging you at range and you're not in cover, there's nothing you can do as you're just too slow to retreat, and lack the consistent firepower to cause much damage. It's important to note here that this boat is largely more effective in AB mode as opposed to RB mode, as the main tedium of playing this boat is aiming the gun, and AB ranges automatically, it still won't excel, but you'll likely notice much better results when playing this mode.
