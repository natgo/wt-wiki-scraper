== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the first vessel of the Army's new [[Soukou-Tei (Family)|Soukou-Tei class]] (装甲艇, Armored Boat), also known as the AB-Tei class. Designed as a naval landing escort boat, its main role was to provide fire support to Daihatsu-type landing craft and to be transportable by cargo ships like other landing craft. The Sakigake (さきがけ, Pioneer) was the initial prototype of her class completed in 1928, powered by a gasoline engine and armed with two [[Type 38 pattern 1907 (6.5 mm)|6.5 mm Type 38 machine guns]] and one [[Type 11 pattern 1922 (37 mm)|37 mm ''"Sniper"'' gun]] in tank-like turrets.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]]. Its main purpose was to provide coastal landing support and river patrol, so it is not very effective on open waters or against fast torpedo boats. The Sakigake in particular also only comes with early interwar armament that fails to deal any significant damage. A possible tactic for using the Sakigake is to ask fellow captains to tow it through the water, so that it can contribute some extra guns and armour that can withstand some low-tier weapons.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The Soukou-Tei (1927) has 6 mm of RHA protecting the turrets and the bridge, apart from this the hull is made up of the standard 6mm of steel. Overall, it's not very survivable at all, it does have some armour, but no enemy boats are going to struggle to get through it, cannons and heavy machine guns will have no trouble punching through. Additionally, because this vessel is so slow it is very easy to hit, as not much lead is required to land shots accurately, this artificially makes it less survivable than contemporary boats, despite the armour protection it has. It does, however, sit very low in the water, so this could lead to enemies missing a fair few shots at you if they're at the range, although like the majority of vessels around this battle rating use autocannons, it likely won't take very long for them to correct the range.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
[[File:Soukou-Tei 1927 survivability.png|thumb|Soukou-Tei under heavy enemy fire - situation that should be avoided at all cost.|left]]
The Soukou-Tei has incredibly poor speed and overall mobility, it can reach a max of 26 km/h in realistic battle modes, which is slower than the vast majority of ships in-game, on some of the larger maps this boat will take an unnecessarily long amount of time to reach combat ranges it can actually fight in, which can be tedious to play around. Its ability to turn isn't terrible but isn't overly impressive either, it's about as much as you'd expect from a vessel this slow.

{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Type 11 pattern 1922 (37 mm)}}

This boat is equipped with a low-velocity 37 mm cannon for its primary weapon, its performance overall is very poor and leaves a lot to be desired. It can only fire HE rounds which don't have a lot of penetration power, but they do adequate damage for the calibre and the gun can fire very rapidly. Despite this, though the gun is very inaccurate and close to unusable at the range, even at close range it's easy to miss, and if your enemy is quite fast it will take a few shots to acquire the lead and start landing shots on target. Additionally, in rougher conditions, the gun is almost entirely unusable, as it will bob up and down to such an extent that it becomes a real chore to land shots within even a few hundred metres.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->

{{main|Type 38 pattern 1907 (6.5 mm)}}

The Soukou-Tei also comes with two 6.5 mm machine guns, and these are close to being the least effective offensive weapons in the entire game. They can't penetrate the hull of any ships reliably past a few hundred metres and are limited to only being able to knock out exposed crew members, and even this is incredibly unreliable. The guns can only really deal reliable damage against aircraft, however, the guns cannot elevate past 25 degrees, meaning that if an aircraft is diving down to attack, these secondary guns will not be able to fire at them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Because of all the various drawbacks this vessel has, it's hard to pinpoint a truly effective way to play it, as it just does not excel in any capacity. A safe, and arguably effective way to play it is by using it as an escort for some of the larger ships on your team, this works in theory, but in practice, a lot of the large support vessels around this battle rating are almost twice as fast as you, so you'll likely be left lagging behind the group.

In any case, though aiming to stay close to friendlies is the best way to keep yourself afloat, you can't take much fire and you can't dish out damage, so you'll need a buffer from your team to help you out, in a one on one engagement you'll likely lose, as you just don't have the accuracy of the firepower to be able to quickly sink enemy boats at long or close range. You can, however, aid some of the larger ships in sinking enemy boats, try to aim for the same targets as your team to contribute to knocking them out.

Because most if not all friendly vessels will outpace you, try to aim to reach some cover around some commonly travelled areas of the map first, and then team up with any large friendly ships that come close to you afterwards, this allows for you to stay relatively safe for as long as possible. Try not to stray too far from cover or friendlies, you can't reliably engage past 1,000 m anyway, and if an enemy starts engaging you at range and you're not in cover, there's nothing you can do as you're just too slow to retreat, and lack the firepower to cause much damage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
[[File:Soukou-Tei 1927 cover.png|thumb|right|Soukou-Tei historically was used along coasts and rivers, similarly in-game it's most effective when using natural obstacles to surprise opponents and use its shallow draft to take positions larger boats cannot.]]

'''Pros:'''

* Fast rate of fire for the main gun

'''Cons:'''

* Incredibly slow
* Very weak firepower overall
* Very inaccurate main gun
* Secondary guns can't aim upwards to defend from aircraft
* Can't hit anything in wavy waters

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
