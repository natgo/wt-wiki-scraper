== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
During the 1970s, a project named "Swordfish" was created with the goal of developing a hydrofoil that would be fast and manoeuvrable for coastal and sea patrols. The project began with the [[USS Tucumcari]], then progressed to the Pegasus class. Eventually, the P-420 Sparviero was created as part of the project, equipped with a single 76 mm OTO-MELARA gun and later fitted with OTOMAT anti-ship missiles. Its purpose was to replace the outdated Italian torpedo boats; however, it was later discovered that hydrofoils like the Sparviero were too expensive to maintain. The Sparviero P-420 was the prototype of the subsequent Nibbio class, while the mass production vessels of the Nibbio class, funded by the 1975 Naval Law, incorporated improvements in hydrodynamics, electronics, and other aspects. CNR Muggiano built six units of the Nibbio class by 1983. The Sparviero undertook several training and coastal control missions, until it was decommissioned after the Cold War along with the other vessels of the Nibbio class.

Introduced as a premium pack during [[Update "Starfighters"]], it was removed from the store after the 2020 New Year sale and reintroduced later in 2021 as a premium vehicle purchasable in-game with Golden Eagles  {{ge}} in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]]. The Sparviero exhibits remarkable agility and speed. Its armament consists of a single 76 mm OTO-MELARA cannon, which proves effective against almost all encountered enemy targets. However, due to its hydrofoil design, it can be challenging to handle, so it is advisable to slow down when engaging enemy vessels. Its survivability is not among the best, meaning you'll have to be cautious when facing other enemy ships.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Sparviero's crew is protected by 8 mm of armour around the hull, and 3 mm of armour around the superstructure. This lacklustre armour isn't substantial enough to protect the ship from constant damage from machine guns or auto cannons. The gun in particular is extremely easy to disable thanks to its size and position on the ship. The Sparviero has the best chance for survival when it is on a flanking rout using its high speed to avoid frontal engagements. The gunboat also lacks anti-aircraft guns controlled by AI to defend against planes, but that can be countered by loading the variable time shell and shooting manually at aircraft.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility}}

The Sparviero is one of the few ships equipped with a hydrofoil, allowing the gun boat to reach a high speed of 93 km/h when raised out of the water, but while out of the water the ship becomes difficult to manoeuvre in tight environments. In contrast, the Sparviero can only move 20 km/h in reverse, but the hull will remain in the water. While the ship's hull is submerged, the hydrofoils pose a risk of ramming parts of the environment, such as reefs and land under shallow water, so it is recommended to learn what positions might pose a threat to beaching the boat.

Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|76 mm/62 OTO-Melara Compact (76 mm)}}

Sparviero is equipped with the amazing 76 mm/62 OTO-Melara Compact automatic gun in a single turret on the bow of the boat right before the bridge. The 76 mm gun comes stocked with HE-MOM, SAPOM, and HE-MOM with a variable time fuse. Both HE-MOM shells have 15 mm of pen at any range with an explosive mass of 750 g, while the SAPOM can pen 60 mm at a range of 100 m with an explosive mass of 455 g. The best loadout for the Sparviero is half a loadout (or more) or SAPOM, while the rest is dedicated to HE-MOM with variable time fuse. Both HE shells do the same damage towards ships, so it is more desirable to bring the more versatile shell that can also be used against aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Being one of the fastest boats in naval forces, the Sparviero excels in rushing advantageous positions to defend capture points and flank enemy routes. The gunboat shouldn't be used for contesting points directly due to its weak crew size, and protection unless the area has already been cleared. The largest threat to the Sparviero are similar hydrofoils and faster patrol boats such as the [[PG 02]], and the [[PT-811]] which can contest the Sparviero from reaching flanking spots, using their superior speed and firepower. Similarly tiered destroyers such as the [[USS Barker]] also pose a threat because their main armaments can hullbreak the smaller gunboat.

The Sparviero is a fairly complicated hydrofoil to play, it's a ship that needs to be played for quite a while to be fully understood. With its light armour, it will be hard to come out of a solo encounter as a winner. This ship should be played in a group, be it with other Sparviero or other ships, NEVER be alone. With its excellent rate of fire, it can take out light ships in a few shots. It is recommended to bring 60 SAPOM and 35 HE-VT MOM shells. Unfortunately with the low penetration of the SAPOMs you will only be able to shoot at small and light targets, or aim at precise modules on the slightly larger ships, for example the main turrets or engines.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Amazing speed
* Effective cannon
* Access to a radar

'''Cons:'''

* Low crew count
* Inadequate armour
* Lacklustre firing angles (blind spot at the rear of the ship)
* Awkward mobility

In the 1970s, on a derivation of the American "pegasus" project, the 928-22A "swordfish" project was born, which was to be known as the ''"Sparviero"'' (P420), It was a missile hydrofoil with "submerged wings" designed to replace torpedo boats and motorboats in the difficult Adriatic theatre.

The program was to be financed by the 1975 Naval Law and after the prototype ''"Sparviero"'', CNR Muggiano would construct 6 units, finally completed in 1983.

Built in light alloy with a honeycomb structure, they were armed with a 76/62 OTO super fast gun and 2 OTOMAT missiles.

At 23 metres and about 60 tons fully loaded, it had the concentrated firepower of a frigate, governed by a crew of 10 men.

The ''Sparviero'' P420 hydrofoil is the prototype of the ''Nibbio'' class, a series of missile hydrofoils that remained as a remnant of the NATO program in seven examples including the prototype ''Sparviero''.

These hydrofoils entered service during the '70s in the MMI (Italian Navy), the hydrofoils were classified with P and the pennant number, all 7 examples were put into service and these were:

* ''Sparviero'' - P420
* ''Nibbio'' - P421
* ''Falcone'' - P422
* ''Astore'' - P423
* ''Grifone'' - P424
* ''Gheppio'' - P425
* ''Condor'' - P426

The end of the Cold War also decreed the decommissioning of the hydrofoils, which were partially replaced by new smaller units, such as the Commander class, whose operational capabilities are extended by the availability of a helicopter on board.

These hydrofoils remained in service until they were decommissioned during the early 2000s.

'''Japanese service'''

3 ''Nibbio''-class ships were built for Japan and delivered between 1993 and 1995 but they had a different armament from the Italian ones, a JM61-M Vulcan 20 mm minigun and 4 SSM-1B missiles.

The class was renamed to Missile-Tei 1-Go and consisted of:

* ''PG-01''
* ''[[PG 02]]''
* ''PG-03''

=== [[wt:en/news/6690-development-italian-fleet-early-access-packs-en|Devblog]] ===
During the 1960s, the Alinavi consortium developed a hydrofoil attack craft on the basis of the PGH-2 Tucumcari design, previously built by Boeing. In the early 1970s, a prototype was ordered for construction, receiving the name "Sparviero". The Sparvieros served faithfully with the Italian Navy until early in 2000 before being finally decommissioned.
