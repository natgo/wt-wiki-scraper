== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Stefano Turr is surprisingly quite a survivable ship for its almost total lack of armour. It has a quite low crew of 16 people for its size. But this is its secret weapon in soaking up damage - similarly to tanks like the [[LVT(A)(1)]], its crew is quite spread out across the ship, meaning it will take more time to incapacitate them all, giving the player a chance of surviving. Beware that the armament operators are completely exposed meaning that you can easily lose one or more of your machine guns.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility}}

The mobility of the ship is really good for how big it is - you can keep up with many torpedo boats and leave slower ships like the [[VAS 201]] in the dust. One thing to note is its turning circle is quite large and it turns quite slowly. Overall it has really good speed in a straight time, but if you decide to turn, you'll lose a lot of speed.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells.

Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Breda Model 31 (13.2 mm)|Fiat Model 26 (6.5 mm)}}

The Stefano Turr is equipped with two types of machine guns for its primary armament - three 13.2 mm Breda machine guns arranged in a very asymmetrical layout in front of the bridge and a 6.5 mm Fiat machine gun on the stern. Overall, the three Breda machine guns are enough to make a dent in many enemy ships and are considered more effective than the 20 mm autocannons of other same BR italian boats. Due to their positioning you don't need to expose anything but your front to an enemy (in contrast to other low tier italian boats). The 6.5 mm is very weak and if you are flanked from the rear, it's better to turn around, rather than engaging them with the Fiat machine gun. The biggest drawback of the 13 mm machine guns is their rate of fire - lower than machine guns from other nations, especially German and American ones.

Be aware that there are no AI controlled weapons on this ship (like most low tier torpedo boats) so you'll need to handle planes manually.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|S.I.170/450X5,25 (450 mm)|B TG depth charge}}

The Stefano Turr can equip 4 x 450 mm S.I.170 torpedoes. Taking them is not advised most of the time as, if shot, they can detonate and critically damage the vessel, if not sinking it outright. The torpedoes themselves are average, with reasonable speed and enough explosive force to destroy most enemies. If you decide to take them, concentrate your torpedo fire on large and/or slow ships - prime examples are the [[110 ft SC-497]], [[165 ft PC-451]], [[Type K-3 / No.1 Class|Type K-3]], [[Type K-7 / No.4 Class|Type K-7]], [[Type 5]] escort boat, and Russian armoured river boats. Smaller boats, if prepared, will easily dodge them.

The Stefano Turr can also equip 12 B TG depth charges. They are next to useless, as they are made for destroying submarines, which are not in the game. Most ships, especially small boats, will easily escape the blast. The depth charge racks are considered an ammo rack and will explode and destroy the ship, once destroyed. Overall, taking depth charges are not recommended under any circumstances.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Stefano Turr is an interesting ship to say the least - with its large profile, good speed but bad manoeuvrability, asymmetrical, mixed armaments and lots of torpedoes lead to a somewhat interesting playstyle. The main tactic when using her is as follows: Pick a target and face forwards towards them - this can maximise your survivability and you can use all of your best armaments this way. When facing a large, armoured ship, feel free to use the torpedoes. Its biggest disadvantages are the low rate of fire of the main weapons, the large profile and the lack of AI weaponry. These cons are quite minor and can easily be mitigated. Overall the Stefano Turr is a different ship from her Italian peers and can be very fun.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good straight line top speed
* Good survivability for a torpedo boat - small crew is spread around the entirety of a not that small ship
* All of the best armaments are frontal facing and all armaments can be used in abroadside (because of the asymmetric positioning of the frontal weapons)
* Good torpedoes can deal with armoured or heavy enemies

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turn time
* No armour
* Large profile
* Low main weapon rate of fire
* Somewhat small main armament clips

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Regia Marina attempted to replace the MAS units in 1934, on the initiative of Admiral Domenico Cavagnari (Sottosegretario and Capo di Stato Maggiore between 1933 and 1940), he picked the new ship that would replace the MAS, a motor torpedo boat with metallic hull and Stefano Turr hull of 61.6 tons but the project was too ambitious for the time being.
[[File:Stefano Turr History I.png|thumb|Stefano Turr during seal]]
Indeed, the ship was larger than the MAS and it caused propulsion problems. The planned four 750 HP FIAT V 1616 fast diesel engine were insufficient to power the vessel in 1936 and it compromised the success of the project. A subsequent FIAT project, proposed in 1938, in view of the realization of a new type of 1,500 HP fast diesel engine, was rejected by the Ministry. A modified Turr based on 4 Isotta Fraschini Asso 1000 engines adapted to run on low pressure naphta was studied in 1938. It aimed at displacing 50 tons and sailing at 40 knots, but the engines in question were developed only twenty years later.
