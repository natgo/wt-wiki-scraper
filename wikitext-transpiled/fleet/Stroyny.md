== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Storozhevoy-class destroyer built for Soviet Navy in the late 1930s as the Project 7U (''Uluchshenny''; improved) where the design flaws of previous [[Pr.7 (Family)|Project 7 Gnevny-class]] were addressed. She was laid down on 29th December 1938 as a Gnevny-class destroyer but she was rebuilt to Storozhevoy-class standard following Stalin's orders. She was commissioned on 30th August 1941. She spent her entire war career in the Leningrad area conducting shore bombardment and naval gunfire support. During her service, she had to have gun liners exchanged twice, as her main armament fired a total of 5,424 shells in the span of four years. In 1953, she was converted into a rescue ship, made a target ship in 1963, and sold for scrap two years later.

Stroyny was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5666-fleet-development-soviet-navy-and-the-stroyny-destroyer-en|premium pack]] during [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]]. As the main armament of all Project 7U destroyers is manually driven, the turrets suffer from poor traverse speed rendering these difficult when switching targets. The guns themselves are also protected only by 8 mm thick antifragmentation armour covering sides, front and top side. As with most destroyers from other navies as well, the Storozhevoy class features unarmoured magazines above waterline leading to fatal explosion when hit. Her boilers and transmission also take up nearly the entire length of the ship past the bridge.

It was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6263-shop-war-thunder-summer-sale-en|2019 Summer sale]]. It was made available for purchase with Golden Eagles {{ge}} for the [[wt:en/news/6291-event-russian-navy-day-en|2019 "Russian Navy Day"]] mini-event until it was removed from in-game sale after the [[wt:en/news/6915-development-fleet-research-changes-and-the-first-battleships-en|split of naval into Bluewater and Coastal trees]] in [[Update "New Power"]]. It was briefly made available for purchase with Golden Eagles {{ge}} for the [[wt:ru/news/15831-akciya-den-vmf-rossii-ru|2022]] and [[wt:en/news/8377-special-stroyny-and-neustrashimy-for-golden-eagles-en|2023]] "Russian Navy Day" mini-events.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Overall the armour on the Pr. 7U is mediocre and practically useless. Calibres from 30 mm and higher will have no problem with penetrating the armour and causing damages. Due to crew count, it is able to withstand a relative amount of time under heavy combat. However, heavy combat is unadvised in ships like the Pr. 7U considering your armour is lacklustre. When it comes to components, it is almost impossible to make an ammo explosion as the ammunition is below the waterline, meaning only armour piercing rounds fired below the waterline or torpedoes will be able to create an ammo explosion. When it comes to air threats (machine guns strafes, rockets, bombs), the Pr. 7U will be able to survive them with some exceptions of bombs. Bombs that land in a 0-40 m radius of the ships can cause fatal damage (it will also depend on the type of bomb, weight, TNT equivalent, etc).

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Mobility-wise, the Pr. 7U is nothing we have not seen before, ~65 km/h top speed with really wide and slow turning radius. Soviet destroyers (until the Pr.56) are not known for being fast and should not use speed as primary advantage.

{{main|B-13 (130 mm)}}

The Stroyny carries four 130 mm B-13 single mountings, with two turrets ahead of the superstructure and two behind. The B-13 cannon is shared by most WWII-era destroyers of the Soviet fleet, and is a very potent weapon. However, the main flaw with this weapon is its absolutely horrid turret rotation speed of 4.2 degrees / second vertically and horizontally. This means that you have to turn the turrets very early to be able to engage effectively. The guns themselves shoot accurately and have a high initial velocity (870 m/s compared to 790 m/s for the American 5"/38 guns). However, this comes at the expense of reload speed, as the manually-loaded weapons can only fire at 10 rounds per minute (RPM) with a spaded crew, compared to 22 RPM for the American 5"/38. In fact, this fire rate is slower than everything except for the Japanese and Italian 5" guns, which have a similar fire rate.

The guns themselves have access to three shell types: the OF-46 high-explosive (HE) shell, the PB-46A semi armour-piercing (SAPBC) shell, and the ZS-46R proximity-fuzed (HE-VT) shell. Of these weapons, the HE shell is usually the best against enemy destroyers and ships as it packs the most explosive filler, 3.58 kilograms of it to be exact. The SAPBC shell works better against the occasional cruiser you may encounter, as it packs more penetration capacity (up to 179 mm compared to 36 mm for the HE shell). Finally, the HE-VT shell is good against aircraft as it will explode when close enough to the enemy aircraft, meaning that it doesn't require a direct hit. However, it actually packs less explosive filler than the normal HE shell, which is unusual for any HE-VT shell. Combined with the horrible traverse rate, this means the guns aren't particularly suited for anti-aircraft duties.

{{main|34-K (76 mm)}}

The Stroyny carries three 76 mm (3-inch) 34-K mountings in single mounts, all at the rear - one additional mount than its tech-tree cousin, the [[Soobrazitelny]]. The 34-K is also shared by most WWII-era Soviet ships, and gives you a potent secondary weapon that is of a relatively high calibre. This gun has a high fire rate of 27 rounds per minute (2.2-second reload), which can be decreased to 1.1 seconds with a full crew. The weapon itself is decent at closer ranges, but isn't a particularly effective anti-aircraft weapon as it inherits the extremely weak Soviet traverse rate. The single mountings themselves are only capable of traversing at 10 degrees per second, marginally faster than guns of cruiser calibre (6 inch+) of other nations.

The gun itself has access to three main shell types - the O-361K high-explosive (HE) shell, the O-361D time-fuzed (HE-TF) shell, and the BR-361 armour-piercing (APHEBC) shell. Of these rounds, the HE is almost always the best against enemy boats as it has the most explosive filler, and consequently, does the most damage. The HE-TF round is slightly worse as it detonates on a timed fuze, meaning the accuracy of the shell depends on crew skills. Finally, the APHEBC shells are rarely usable due to their low damage potential. For good measure, bring mostly HE, and a bit of HE-TF and APHEBC just in case the situation arises.

<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness â€“ including against surface targets.

{{main|37 mm/67 70-K (37 mm)|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

The Stroyny actually has less anti-aircraft armament than the tech-tree Pr. 7U, but still more than enough to defend itself from any airborne threats.

The primary backbone of the Stroyny's anti-aircraft armament are it's six 37 mm 70-K anti aircraft guns. The 70-K is the standard Soviet anti-aircraft gun and serves as a reliable counterpart to the 40 mm Bofors gun used by the allied nations. This gun is extremely similar to the Bofors as it features a similar design, and fires continuously rather than needing to reload. The guns will eventually jam, but the time it takes to jam the weapons is very long so jamming is not a great issue. The weapon does not get access to belts, but the default one is very suited for ripping small ships or aircraft into shreds.

The Stroyny also carries four 12.7 mm DShK guns in single mountings. The 12.7 mm DShK machine gun is a heavy machine gun, similar to the M2 Browning used by the Americans and the Vickers guns used by the British. This gun fires from a fixed 50-round magazine and will need to be reloaded after the magazine is expended. The gun itself is rather mediocre, and will struggle to hit targets reliably at ranges exceeding 1.5 km. As well, the weapon doesn't do damage particularly well, considering that it is of a lower calibre. The Stroyny does not get access to any ammunition belt upgrades - the default one is the only belt available.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|53-38 (533 mm)|BB-1 depth charge}}

The Stroyny gets access to six 53-38 torpedoes in two triple mounts with no reloads. The 53-38 torpedo is also found on most other Soviet WWII-era destroyers, and is relatively mediocre as far as torpedoes go. In terms of damage-dealing capabilities, the torpedo is decidedly mediocre, having more explosive filler (300 kg of TNT) than the American torpedoes but less than the British and Japanese ones. However, the main drawback of the torpedo is it's range - without the "torpedo mode" modification, the 53-38s are restricted to a range of just 4 km, meaning that they are tied for the shortest-range bluewater-ship mounted torpedoes along with the Italian destroyer torpedoes. The torpedo mode modification is necessary for hitting longer-ranged targets, but reduces the torpedo's speed to just 56 km/h. In general, these torpedoes are a potent weapon against enemy bluewater ships, but lack the range to do significant damage without the "torpedo mode" modification.

The Stroyny can bring two BB-1 large depth charges, but these weapons are almost entirely useless as you will never get close enough to the enemy to be able to use them. Thus, they essentially serve as extra explosive content on deck, and provide little extra armament in exchange for an increased chance of ammunition (depth charge) detonation. In general, it is not recommended to bring them.

Stroyny was one of the final ships from the renowned Type 7 series. In fact, she hadn't even undergone the required tests before the start of the war. With only one commissioned engine, Stroyny proceeded to the Ust-Izhora shipyard and engaged the German troops assaulting Leningrad. While the city was under siege, the destroyer's crew laid down continuous fire on the enemy positions and provided fire support to the Red Army troops breaking through the blockade. According to the official data, Stroyny's primary armament fired a whole 5,424 rounds on the enemy during the Siege of Leningrad! Due to such intense levels of fire, the ship's gun liners â€“ the special insertable tubes with cuts that are used in gun barrels â€“ had to be changed twice. After the blockade was broken, Stroyny was stationed in Leningrad, where it remained until the war was over. In the post-war period, the destroyer was converted into a rescue vessel and later on used as a target ship. Stroyny was retired from military service in 1965.
