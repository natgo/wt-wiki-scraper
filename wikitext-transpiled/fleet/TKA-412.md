== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''TKA-412''' Motor Gun Boat represents the latest model and a heavily modified version of the [[G-5]] Motor Torpedo Boat. Its main differences from other G-5s lie in its inclusion of two 12.7 mm [[DShK (12.7 mm)|DShK]] heavy machine guns, instead of the usual one, and an additional rocket launcher capable of firing [[M-8]] rockets. Unlike other G-5 models, it no longer carries torpedoes; its primary purpose now is serving as a motor gun boat, primarily utilized for firepower support during WW2 landing operations.

This boat was introduced during [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6703-event-winner-vehicles-for-the-victory-anniversary-en|Victory Day]] event and returned as one of the random rewards in [[Battle Pass: Season XVI, "Skilled Marksman"]]. Gameplay-wise, it remains quite similar to other G-5 models in the game. Its superior speed compared to other boats at its BR allows for quick capture of strategic points. Additionally, armed with two 12.7 mm DShK heavy machine guns, it can swiftly handle most boats at its BR. However, the standout feature of the TKA-412 is its M-8 rockets. Capable of carrying 48 of these rockets, it has the potential to obliterate any boats it successfully hits.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour. -->
As with the regular [[G-5]], the TKA-412 has practically no survivability. The ship has a tiny crew count of just six crew members and no armour, meaning that a couple of machine gun hits can knock the vessel out. The ship's vital components are all clustered close together, making them vulnerable to damage.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed. -->
The TKA-412 is an extremely mobile vessel. It can reach a top speed of 107 km/h in realistic mode and 138 km/h in arcade, making it one of the fastest vessels in the game, even faster than its predecessor. The TKA-412 also benefits from a fast acceleration to its top speed. The ship's turn time is quite fast, though keep in mind that sustained turns will result in much of the ship's speed being bled away.

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: {{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose. -->
{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}
The TKA-412 carries a pair of DShK machine guns as its main armament. The 12.7 mm DShK machine gun is a heavy machine gun, similar to the M2 Browning used by the Americans and the Vickers guns used by the British. This gun fires from a fixed 50-round magazine and will need to be reloaded after the magazine is expended. The DShK isn't a particularly high-damaging weapon and drops off in effectiveness past 1.5 km. However, it is still quite effective when in use against small coastal vessels. The TKA-412 gets access to three ammunition belts: Universal, HE, and AP. Of these belts, the HE belt is most effective against smaller vessels and aircraft.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section. -->
{{main|M-8}}
The TKA-412 gets access to 48 M-8 rockets, with 24 mounted in a trainable launcher and 24 more in a quick-reload magazine. The M-8 rocket is quite adequate for damaging larger targets and are quite easy to aim. However, these rockets are less lethal than some comparable munitions, due to their lower calibre and small TNT warhead (0.6 kg). As a result, it is advisable to salvo-fire the M-8s against large targets in order to ensure their destruction quickly and easily.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

When playing very vulnerable ships like the TKA-412, you should adopt a hit-and-run tactic. Move towards the enemy while hiding behind cover (islands or obstacles) then strike with speed and retreat back to cover. You can use your 2 x 12.7 mm DShK machine guns against smaller enemies like MTBs and your rockets against bigger enemies like sub-chasers. The hit-and-run tactic works in every game mode. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely fast (faster than even the previous G-5 versions)
* 2 gunners instead of 1
* Superior locations for the weapons (no frontal blind spot)
* 12.7 mm is enough to damage and destroy other boats and planes at the battle rating
* Rocket-rack can unleash a deadly barrage, and has reserve to fully reload once

'''Cons:'''

* No torpedoes
* Rockets are inaccurate and prove difficult to aim on water
* Few crew members
* Exposed ammunition boxes increase chance of being ammo-racked

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The G-5 torpedo boats became the most common small vessel of this kind in the Soviet fleet during WWII. At the end of 1942, an experimental series of artillery boats was built, in which torpedo equipment was replaced with rocket launchers. During the tests, the project was recognized as successful and all 6 experimental boats were included in the second brigade of torpedo boats in the Black Sea Fleet.
