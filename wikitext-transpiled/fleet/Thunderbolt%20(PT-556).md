== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the fleet release into Open Beta Test.

The Thunderbolt is an Elco 80 ft-class patrol boat that is unique from her sister craft since she sports a quad 20 mm gun mount at the aft of the vessel.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Similar to the other [[:Category:Coastal Fleet USA|Elco boats]], the PT-556 has 6.35 mm of hardened armour protecting the helmsman, who is a critical crew member. With a crew complement of 12 predominately operating guns above deck, this boat can be knocked out relatively easily. The quad [[Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)|Oerlikon]] mount on the rear features a protected "basket" with an open top, sporting the same 6.35 mm sides and back with a 12.7 mm front plate.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

This boat weighs as much as the heavier [[Elco 80 ft PT-565|PT-565]] while maintaining the top speed of the lighter [[Elco 80 ft PT-314|PT-314]], helping this boat live up to the nickname "Thunderbolt" which is scribed on the rear quad mount. With a top speed of 106 km/h in Arcade Battles, this boat is among the fastest in game. Additionally, it sports a high reverse speed and is capable of tight turns.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

The primary armament consists of a quad-mounted 20 mm [[Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)|Oerlikon Mk.II]] turret aft and a single cannon at the front. They are extremely deadly to any small targets.

Both turrets have fast traverse rate and good elevation angles, so there should be no problem in engaging aircraft. Short bursts are all it should take to take out any unarmoured targets or aircraft. The ballistics should be familiar from the other PT boats. You should have some trigger discipline because you don't have enough ammunition to "spray and pray".

The placement of the quad mount makes for a forward dead zone of roughly 20 degrees and roughly 45 degrees left and right of the bow. This can limit the ability to engage targets with maximum closing speed and maximum firepower at once.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|AN-M4 (37 mm)}}

The secondary armament on this boat is a 37 mm AN-M4 cannon at the front of the boat. The low rate of fire and low velocity makes it unsuitable for general use, but can act as a decent supporting fire to the 20 mm cannons when the secondary armament control switch is set to the ON position. It is unsuitable for anti-aircraft because of the problems mentioned above and the fact that it has poor elevation angles. The high explosive shells also self-destruct, so you can't engage with them past medium ranges. The penetration rates of the armour-piercing shells are on par with the main Oerlikon cannons, so you can have it as your backup for armoured targets.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

The PT-556 utilizes the same AA layout as the [[Elco 80 ft PT-565#Anti-aircraft armament|PT-565]], however it does offer twice the ammunition load at 8,000 rounds for the two dual-mount [[AN-M2 (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm AN-M2]] emplacements. The dual-mount 12.7 mm machine guns are decent at hitting slow-flying aircraft such as floatplanes, as well as damaging frail PT boats such as the reserve torpedo boats. However, against targets at a distance greater than 500 m, the .50 cal MGs will struggle to hit the target. Even if they do hit, at such distances the damage dealt is unnoticeable, so expect the .50 cals to be of no use unless the offending aircraft or PT is right on top of the Thunderbolt.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.13 (569 mm)}}

The PT-556 carries four Mk.13 torpedoes with 178 kg of explosives, a pretty weak explosive mass compared to counterparts from other countries. Still, it still packs some punch to cripple enemy ships, and since you're carrying four torpedoes instead of two like other PT boats, these can be very helpful in case if you've missed a hit. Setting the depth stroke to 4 m instead of 1 m can alleviate the low explosive mass, but it is still recommended to fire the torpedoes in a salvo of two unless you are confident a single torpedo will strike the target.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The PT-556 is a PT boat that packed with heavy firepower in the form of 5 x 20 mm Oerlikon cannons and other supplementary armaments. As its nickname ''Thunderbolt'' suggests, the playstyle of this boat is strike hard and strike fast before retreating.

Due to the boat's poor survivability, speed and positioning is the key of success. Never rush into the enemy and instead utilizing covers or moving in pack with your teammates. In this way, you can provide heavy fire support on any distracted enemy.

Against destroyers, the PT-556 has no trouble to destroy them with four small torpedoes, albeit usually requires more than one hit to kill them. Thanks to your 4 x 20 mm Oerlikon cannons, you can kill the enemy destroyer by engaging the ship from the sides, then spray your lead into every section the ship's side to wipe out the crew, this is more effective than concentrating on a single section.

Because the main armament is located at the rear of the boat, the Thunderbolt is best used either in a broadside or at a disengaging angle when fighting small PT boats, but against larger ships and destroyers it is recommended to be bow in to reduce the chances of being struck by an HE shell, as well as getting closer to the targeted ship to get a more accurate torpedo spread off.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Main armament consists of five hard-hitting 20 mm Oerlikon cannons
* Rear 4 x 20 mm Oerlikon turret provided very dense cone of fire
* Fast and agile as it is a motorboat
* Can carry 4 x torpedoes, 2 on each side
* AA defence consisting of 4 x 12.7 mm AN-M2 machine guns which provide enough protection
* 37 mm gun can be equipped with AP shells to deal with armoured targets
* 37 mm AN-M4 rounds are pure HE or pure AP and no mix

'''Cons:'''

* 20 mm cannons have low velocity and awkward angle and therefore are hard to aim
* Very poor survivability
* Ammunition storage is next to the fuel tank
* Each individual torpedo is quite weak and often requires more than one hit to sunk enemy destroyer
* 37 mm gun is not accurate

PT-556 was an Elco 80-foot class Motor Torpedo Boat of the United States Navy. It was laid down by the Electric Launch Company (Elco) in Bayonne, NJ, on 1 July 1943. She was launched on 16 September 1943 and completed and commissioned on 20 October 1943.

PT-556 had a length of 80 ft, a beam of 20 ft 8 in, and a draft of 5 ft. The displacement was 56 tons and it was manned by a crew of 17. The ship was powered by three 1,500 shp Packard W-14 M2500 gasoline engines, turning three shafts; a speed of 41 knots could be achieved. The armament consisted of two twin .50 cal mounts (total of four machine guns), four 21 inch torpedoes, and one Elco Thunderbolt quadruple 20 mm mount (total of four 20 mm cannons). The PT-556 was one of the few torpedo boats to be equipped with the Elco Thunderbolt mount.

PT-556 was first assigned to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Twenty-Nine (MBTRon 29), under the command of CDR S. Stephen Daunis, USN. MBTRon 29 was assigned to the Mediterranean and was based at Calvi, Corsica, and later Leghorn, Italy. Operating under the British Coastal Forces, the squadron saw action along the northwestern coast of Italy and southern coast of France.

PT-556 was transferred to the Soviet Union on 12 April 1945, and was reclassified as TK-435. Her fate after transfer is unknown.
