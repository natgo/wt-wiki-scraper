== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''Tornade''' was a French ''torpilleur'' of the [[Bourrasque (Family)|Bourrasque class]], the ninth vessel of her type, launched in February 1925. Details about her military service remain scarce, but it is believed that her primary duties before the outbreak of World War II involved patrol and escort operations. Following the French surrender in 1940, the Tornade came under the control of Vichy France. During Operation Torch in November 1942, she was stationed at Oran, a strategic location targeted by the Allied Center Task Force. At the onset of the battle, the Tornade attempted to reach open sea; however, dense smoke obscured her path, causing her to run aground on a reef. As the crew worked to repair the hull and navigate the ship out, she was struck multiple times by the British light cruiser HMS Aurora, which destroyed her stern and one of her engine rooms. The Tornade capsized to starboard shortly thereafter, on 8 November 1942.

Introduced as a premium destroyer in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' suffers from a very slow turret rotation speed and a low rate of fire, but this is at least partially compensated by the large explosive filler in both HE and SAP shells. The magazines and shell rooms are located deep below the waterline, providing good protection against detonation. Her torpedoes are excellent for the battle rating, featuring long range, high speed, and a large warhead. Compared to her researchable equivalent, she is equipped with an additional pair of 13.2 mm machine guns on either side of the superstructure at deck level for anti-air defense.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Tornade, like other Bourrasque-class destroyers, features minimal armour, instead relying on its mobility and small size to avoid being hit. The only armour that can be found on the ship are the gun shields, reaching 10 mm thick. The ship is quite compact, meaning most shots that hit the vessel will damage or destroy a component, and the small number of crew means that prolonged combat will eventually lead to its destruction.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
