== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The Model 4 is protected by the standard 40 mm of wood making up the hull, which doesn't offer much actual protection overall. All but the smallest weapons will be able to cause structural damage at most combat ranges, and the vast majority of weapons will be able to penetrate the hull to damage internal components. Of note however are this boats engines- it has three, one conventional engine in the hull of the boat, with two additional exposed aircraft engines towards the back of the deck, this gives it more speed but as the engines are exposed, they're very weak to fire, one or two cannon shots will render them out of action; on the plus side however, these engines are still small targets and hard to hit, so as long as you're not making yourself an easy target they shouldn't catch too much fire.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The Model 4 is very impressive mobility wise, it can reach 71 km/h in RB modes, and 107 km/h in AB modes, making it one of the fastest Japanese vessels overall. It's also very responsive  to control inputs, and will turn very quickly, meaning that if need be, you can turn a full 180 degrees and retreat instead of reversing, as long as the speed is kept high this vessel will remain very manoeuvrable.

{{main|Type 4 (37 mm)}}

The Model 4 uses the Type 4 37 mm naval cannon as its primary weapon, it has a relatively quick reload but an overall unimpressive damage output. It has access to two types of ammunition.

* HE - High explosive, adequate damage output for the calibre of gun.
* APHE - Armour piercing high explosive, very little viability- little to no damage output unless striking a critical component multiple times.

Overall the HE is the round to main when playing the Model 2, the APHE just doesn't do enough reliable damage to make it worth using as a primary round, the HE will cause much more damage structurally. It's only really viable to use at closer ranges as well, it's not the easiest gun to aim at long range and at close range the secondary 20 mm cannon will be a more reliable weapon, even against armoured targets.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 98 (20 mm)}}

The Model 4 is equipped with twin 20 mm Type 98 cannons for its secondary weapon. These cannons perform very well against aircraft and boats alike, however they can only fire to the sides of the boat, due to the bridge and exposed engines blocking the line of fire. All in all, its a modestly powerful weapon and more reliable than the primary 37 mm gun. It works well at close range, and can function adequately up to around 1,500 m, but at this distance it will struggle to do a lot of damage. The magazine contains 20 rounds and reloads very quickly, allowing for a steady stream of fire against enemy vessels or aircraft. It comes with three belts-

* '''Universal:''' {{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}
* '''HET:''' {{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}
* '''APT:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}

Overall, the HET type rounds do the most damage consistently to most of the vessels you'll be coming across, so it's best to take a lot of HET belts, though also consider bringing some armour piercing belts in case you come across some more heavily armoured boats, as the 20 mm has more penetration with its AP rounds than the APHE shell on the 37 mm primary.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 95 depth charge}}

The Model 4 can carry ten Type 95 depth charges, which can be dropped to maim other naval targets, they have rather limited viability though as most MTBs will be able to outrun the explosion, however they are useful for attacking larger ships, as if you can reach them unnoticed one or two of these depth charges will sink the vessel.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
[[File:Type 4 Model 4 (1).jpg|thumb|350px|The Type 4 Model 4 engaging an enemy vessel ]]

Despite the impressive speed of the Model 4, being too aggressive with it will often prove fatal, its' survivability overall is fairly poor, so you really don't want to get caught out. You're going to want to use the twin 20 mm cannons as your primary weapon as they are by far superior to the 37 mm, and because of this you'll need to plan your route through the map carefully. Due to the deadzones in the fire arc of the 20 mm cannons you need to be mindful of where enemies could be engaging you from, one of the worst situations you can find yourself in while playing this boat is running into an enemy head on at close range, you'll need to turn to fire upon your enemy and by this time they will likely have a few seconds to fire upon you, and these few seconds are often fatal.

If you're playing on a map with lots of narrow sight lines, try to avoid sailing directly for them, and instead sail at an angle in their general direction, this way- if an enemy vessel appears from one of these choke points you'll instantly be able to fire upon them, as your boat is fairly weak, you need to minimise all forms of damage dealt towards you, so it's imperative you make sure enemies aren't going to engage you from the front or the back if at all possible.

A good playstyle for this boat is patrolling, using your impressive mobility to sail back and forth across a wide area, keeping an eye on the sight lines and choke points enemies could be coming from, try to avoid areas where enemies could get close to you, as the closer they are the more potential damage you'll take, and the deadzones for your guns will be more of a hindrance, close quarters is the last place you want to be engaging enemies. An ideal range of engagement is around 800-1,000 m, where you can easily make slight turns to allow your cannons more time on target, additionally at this range your engines will be a lot harder to hit, allowing you to stay in the fight longer.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
