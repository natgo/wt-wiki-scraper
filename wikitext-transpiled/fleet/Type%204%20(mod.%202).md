== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The Model 2 is not an overly survivable vessel, but slightly more so than other small Japanese boats. It has 13 crew members, while most other MTBs and sub chasers in rank I have 7 or 10 crewmembers, so it can take a few more hits than most other contemporary boats. Like many of the other small Japanese boats this vessel is unarmoured, only protected by the 8mm of steel making up its hull. The only advantage it has survivability wise is that its engines are fairly small, so it's possible to still retain propulsion while taking fire, however a few well placed high calibre HE shots or a few magazines of cannon fire will still sink the Model 2.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
[[File:Type 4 (mod. 2) Mobility.jpg|thumb|right|]]
The Model 2 doesn't have the most impressive top speed, (48 km/h) in RB mode, but its manoeuvrability isn't terrible, it can perform turns and react fairly well, all the while not losing a huge amount of speed from performing manoeuvres, this allows the boat to consistently be able to avoid potential danger if it's noticed early enough. Its lack of speed doesn't really hurt the Model 2 much, it's a more defensive vessel and has enough potential speed to reach some effective spots on the map without too much trouble. The Type 4 (mod. 2) can manoeuvre its way out of even the most tricky situations thanks to its small size and good turn radius.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|Type 4 (37 mm)}}

The Model 2 uses the Type 4 37 mm naval cannon as its primary weapon, it has a relatively quick reload but an overall unimpressive damage output. It has access to two types of ammunition.

* HE - High explosive, adequate damage output for the calibre of gun.
* APHE - Armour piercing high explosive, very little viability- little to no damage output unless striking a critical component multiple times.

Overall the HE is the round to main when playing the Model 2, the APHE just doesn't do enough reliable damage to make it worth using as a primary round, the HE will cause much more damage structurally. It's only really viable to use at closer ranges as well, it's not the easiest gun to aim at long range and at close range the secondary 20 mm cannon will be a more reliable weapon, even against armoured targets.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 98 (20 mm)}}

The Model 2 is equipped with a single 20 mm Type 98 cannon for its secondary weapon. It has a limited firing arc and can only engage enemy vessels from the sides or rear of the boat. Despite this, its a modestly powerful weapon and more reliable than the primary 37 mm gun. It works well at close range, and can function adequately up to around 1,500 m, but at this distance it will struggle to do a lot of damage. The magazine contains 20 rounds and reloads very quickly, allowing for a steady stream of fire against enemy vessels or aircraft. It comes with three belts-

* '''HET:''' {{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-T|High-explosive fragmentation tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}

Overall, the HET type rounds do the most damage consistently to most of the vessels you'll be coming across, so it's best to take a lot of HET belts, though also consider bringing some armour piercing belts in case you come across some more heavily armoured boats, even though the 20 mm has less penetration with its AP rounds than the APHE shell on the 37 mm primary, the extra output of damage can make up for the APHE's unreliableness.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 3 depth charge}}

The Model 2 can carry ten Type 95 depth charges, which can be dropped to maim other naval targets, they have rather limited viability though as most MTBs will be able to outrun the explosion, however they are useful for attacking larger ships, as if you can reach them unnoticed one or two of these depth charges will sink the vessel.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Model 2 works best in a more defensive role. As its forward facing primary weapon is inconsistent, and its 20 mm secondary is only able to fire at the sides and the rear, aggressive rushes wont be largely effective, as it's very likely you'll run into enemies in blind spots and the few seconds it takes manoeuvring to get your guns on target could very well be fatal. To counter this lack of versatility regarding firepower, hanging around islands or even staying stationary close to the corners of sightlines or cover is a good option, as this allows you to prepare your guns firing angles so that any enemies coming into sight can be reliably fired upon. Your 20 mm is your most reliable weapon at taking on enemy boats, always remember to flush the remainder of your magazine after an engagement so you can engage the next enemy with a full magazine, as you're going to want to do as much damage as possible as quickly as possible. Try to avoid open sight lines and stick to cover, as this will allow you to escape from sight and reengage at a more convenient angle. Your speed isn't the most impressive, so try and avoid rushing far into the map, as you'll lack the speed to retreat fast enough, and you'll likely run into fast enemy boats out of cover, where they will be able to out manoeuvre your guns; play with a defensive mindset and you should get some good results.

This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Karo-Tei Type 2 sub-chaser was developed in the later stages of WW2 and commissioned into service in 1944. The vessel's primary task was to protect the Japanese naval bases at Okinawa and the Philippines from light allied assaults and submarines in particular. The vessel only saw limited use due to the ever worsening war situation for Japan at the time.
