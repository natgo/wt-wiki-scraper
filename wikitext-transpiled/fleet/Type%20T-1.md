== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

== General info ==

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

This boat doesn't have any armour, and its survivability is about on par with other Japanese MTBs in the lower ranks, 40 mm of wooden hull armour- not the worst but not the best. However, its survivability is artificially hindered by its lack of offensive capabilities. In a one on one engagement the T-1 deals so little damage to its enemies, that an opponent will more than likely knock the {{PAGENAME}} out first. So it's survivability is not necessarily worse than other Japanese MTBs, but it will be knocked out a lot more frequently due to how inadequate it is at defending itself.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

The mobility and speed of this boat is its strongest asset. It's responsive to input and can reach a top speed of 72 km/h (44 mph) making it currently the 3rd fastest Japanese ship in game. However, its speed is about equal to most other lower rank MTBs, and in some cases slower. It can outpace Sub-chasers and other gun boats, but it's hard to actually use its speed effectively as its weaponry performance is so poor, the potential it has in its mobility doesn't really count for much.

{{main|Type 92 (7.7 mm)}}

The Type T-1 is equipped with two '''''[[Type 92 navy (7.7 mm)|Type 92 (7.7 mm)]]''''' machine guns, which are incredibly underwhelming. This boat currently has the least effective armament in the game, they do very little damage on all fronts and at even a slight distance struggle to penetrate the hull of most ships, let alone score critical damage. The guns come with three belts-

* Universal- The stock belt, contains a split of armour piercing and armour piercing incendiary rounds
* AP- Contains predominantly armour piercing rounds
* API- Contains predominantly incendiary rounds

Even if it's not by a large margin, the API rounds do deal the most damage, structurally and internally. They also do the most damage to aircraft as well, a good burst on target will usually take out most of the weak biplanes the {{PAGENAME}} will most likely be coming across in the low ranks. To maximise the effectiveness of the guns, stay at a close range, as past around 750 m or so the guns really struggle to do any meaningful damage. The firing arcs of the two turrets are not very versatile either, to fire with both turrets the {{PAGENAME}} needs to be shooting either directly ahead or behind, at either side of the boat only one turret will be able to fire, leading to a tiny amount of damage output.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Type 44 No.2 (450 mm)|Type 95 depth charge}}

The Type T-1 is equipped with two Type-44 torpedoes, they can travel a max of 4 km at 65 km/h (40 mph). With the "Torpedo mode" modification selected they can travel a max of 8 km, at a speed of 48 km/h (30 mph). With this modification they have impressive range for the rank, however they have very little damage output, having only 121 kg of TNT equivalent explosive, they should still be able to cause fatal damage to any vessels around the rank, but against Destroyers or other large ships it will definitely take multiple hits to destroy a ship.

The Type T-1 can carry two Type 95 depth charges, which can be dropped to maim other naval targets, they have rather limited viability though as most MTBs will be able to outrun the explosion. However, they are useful for attacking larger ships, as if the {{PAGENAME}} can reach them unnoticed, one or two of these depth charges will sink the vessel.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
[[File:Type T-1 3.jpg|thumb|500x500px|The Type T-1, engaging an LS Class MTB]]

This boat is fairly difficult to use effectively, especially considering that its damage potential on all fronts is so low. The {{PAGENAME}}'s only reliable way of destroying ships is to use the torpedoes, either aiming for larger slower vessels or aiming for commonly traveled sight-lines or choke points. The primary armament is close to useless in a one on one engagement, so after the torpedoes are launched or being reloaded, try sticking with a group of teammates. The {{PAGENAME}} lacks the firepower to sink an enemy vessel on its own, but can contribute collectively with allies. Try to aim for an enemy's crew if possible, the guns do very little structural damage, but if the shots are aimed at the bridge and radio room, the {{PAGENAME}} can slowly cut down the opponent's crew percentage.

If the {{PAGENAME}} comes across a large ship or vessel with some big guns, it's not worth engaging them, turn on the smokescreen once unlocked and retreat to the proximity of teammates or behind some terrain. There's no use in attacking these vessels with the {{PAGENAME}}'s guns alone. The {{PAGENAME}} can easily have the speed and mobility to escape from tricky situations under the cover of smoke, so prioritise unlocking it if possible. It's important to stay on the move and not make the {{PAGENAME}} a target for enemy vessels, the {{PAGENAME}} has no armour and a well placed burst from any cannon will likely disable the {{PAGENAME}}. Stay by cover and friendlies for protection. Also consider not activating the 'Torpedo mode' modification, as most engagements at this rank won't exceed 4 km, and the extra speed in the torpedoes will be desirable to catch enemies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decently mobile
* Long potential range for the torpedoes

'''Cons:'''

* Hugely ineffective primary armament
* Low damage output from the torpedoes
* Poor firing arcs for the twin turrets
* Poor survivability, even for an MTB

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Boats of this type were developed in 1939 as part of the fourth construction program for the Japanese fleet. They were based on the experimental Type B boat, which in turn was based on the British Thornycroft CMB boat captured in China in 1938. The first boat was put into operation in 1941. In total, six boats of this type were constructed, only one of which survived. In 1942, she was badly damaged and used for training after restoration. The other five boats were lost in conflicts during the years of 1943-1944.
