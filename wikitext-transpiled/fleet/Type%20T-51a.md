== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Danger Zone"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VIII, "Field Testing"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Type T-51a is one of the more tricky boats to use, with a very steep learning curve. The key defining feature of the boat is its rear-mounted gun, able to fire only in reverse, and thus has the option for a two particular playstyles:

'''Ambusher''' - Using hard cover, one can stick the stern out and use the gun with near-impunity, as the rear of the boat is a small target with little crew inside, enabling one to output a huge amount of damage before suffering any significant consequences. That said, enemy positioning has to be monitored at all times, as well as artillery strikes. Also, be careful with controlling speed and when fighting anything larger than a boat - the large-calibre guns found on destroyers can often blow the boat up even if hitting just the rear-most end of the hull. This tactic shines on the maps like African Gulf, Black Sea Port, Drowned City, Ireland Bay, or Vyborg Bay.

An alternative version of this approach is to bait enemy boats into following you, and then shooting directly back at them. Turning and then keeping the profile of the T-51a as narrow as possible is the tricky part, but the high-velocity 25 mm gun can typically sink them before they manage to inflict any significant damage back.

'''Torpedo boat''' - The T-51a has more torpedoes than any other Japanese boats of its rank or lower, and this opens some additional options, even if the torpedoes have a very short range of just 3 kilometres. Use of torpedoes is very opportunistic and typically best used against destroyers (most notably the [[Town (Family)|Town]] and [[Clemson (Family)|Clemson]] class) from behind hard cover. The key is to approach behind cover, select an enemy destroyer as a target and fire torpedoes at the alignment marker before you are directly visible to the enemy guns. Then either reverse or turn around, preferably without ever being in a direct line of fire. The large warhead of the onboard torpedoes will usually sink any destroyer with a single hit. This approach will benefit from a large amount of tall, hard cover on a way to the flanks of the destroyers, and a convenient escape routes, most notably on maps such as Japanese Port, North Port, or Norway.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* High velocity main gun with a short reload time can outdamage most peers, especially if they try to manoeuvre in a medium range
* A very narrow front and rear profile, low freeboard, especially on the rear-end
* Four torpedoes with a very large warhead that can instantly sink every ship around its BR

'''Cons:'''
* Main gun has a very inconvenient firing arc, including the steel shield on the edges of the horizontal arc, that lifts the gun up above the target, while the in-game indicator still shows the gun to be green to fire
* Offset of the gun compared to the aiming reticle along with frequent reloads make it very challenging to engage enemy aircraft
* Large side-profile makes it possible for some boats to kill the T-51a with a single barrage along the ship's length
* Very short-range torpedoes make it challenging to engage destroyers, especially in open waters
