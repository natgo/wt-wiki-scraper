The Alaska class was the first and last US Navy ship class commissioned as a battlecruiser. '''USS Alaska''' was the lead ship of her class, and had two sisters Guam and Hawaii. She was laid down on 17th December 1941 and commissioned on 17th June 1944. The main armament consisted of nine 12 inch/50 Mark 8 guns in triple mounts with two turrets located on the bow and one aft. Her long-range anti-aircraft protection suite was made up of twelve 5 inch/38 Mark 12 dual-purpose guns in twin mounts with three turrets on each side of the hull. Medium and short range anti-aircraft duties were performed by fourteen 40 mm Bofors L/60 Mark 2 guns mounted in quadruple mounts and thirty-four 20 mm Oerlikon Mk. II autocannons located on various places along the ship. During WWII, she participated in the Battle of Okinawa, which was her only major action. On 17th February 1947, Alaska was decommissioned. There was some thought given to converting the Alaska class to missile ships, but these plans never materialised and Alaska was scrapped in 1960.

Alaska was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]]. She is fast and quite manoeuvrable ship, although due to her light armour when compared to for example Scharnhorst-class battlecruisers is no match for battleships in direct encounter. Her magazines located on the waterline are prone to fatal explosion due to only 178 mm thick armour protecting these vital areas. Other than that, her guns offer great penetration values and fast reload only offset by quite small explosive charge of only 7.73 kg TNT eq in her Mark 18 APCBC shells.

{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
USS Alaska has an average mobility for a WW2 battlecruiser. Being a heavy ship, captains of Alaska should not expect to stop from flank speed fastly, a process that can take about half a minute. Being a long ship, changing direction will also take some time and captains of Alaska should expect a large turn radius.

{{main|12-inch/50 Mark 8 (305 mm)}}

The main armament of the Alaska is composed of a total of 9x 305mm 50-calibre cannons, arranged in three triple turrets with two superfiring fore and one aft. The gun handling is not slow, but not especially fast for the size of the turrets. The maximum reload speed is quite competitive at 20 seconds, though most players of the ship won't have a top level crew and thus will have a somewhat slower reload.

The Alaska has access to two shell types for the main guns.

The armour-piercing shell is the main one you'll use for opposing capital ships and occasionally on cruisers that may have a lot of armour or are angled. The AP shell of the Alaska was designed as a so called 'super-heavy' shell, which means that it has a lot bit more mass than a normal AP shell. This means the shell has less muzzle velocity, intended to give the shells a sharper descent angle when coming down on an opposing vessel, a little like a mortar, with the hopes of going through deck armour, which tends to be relatively thin.

The problem with this is that the US didn't realise that the range needed to have the shells drop at a flat enough angle on the deck to effectively penetrate most deck armour was quite a bit further than you could physically aim with any real accuracy. Even ignoring that, warships in naval battles tend to always want to close the range anyway in order to be able to aim accurately and/or use torpedoes, which would rapidly diminish the possibility of penetrating deck armour. What this means is that you simply cannot use the shells for their intended purpose of hitting deck armour, meanwhile the lower muzzle velocity makes aiming your AP shells more difficult and shells hitting the side of an enemy vessel are at a sharper angle than they would otherwise have been, which makes it unnecessarily harder to penetrate enemy side armour. Not only that but, as is typical for US warships, the AP shell has a relatively poor bursting charge of less than 8kg. However, the shells retain relatively high penetration statistics and so that still remain a threat to other capital ships, if aimed at the right places.

The HE shell of the Alaska is a more normal naval shell and the 35kg of explosive power is fairly decent for its calibre. Although it's not too competitive compared to the real hard hitting HE shells at top tier naval, this shell will still enable you effectively dispatch lightly armoured vessels such as destroyers and small cruisers without difficulty, as well as being able to harass anything on the deck of opposing capital ships.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located midships are two catapults with one OS2U-1 scout plane each which provide unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. Alongside the typical abilities of strafing, dropping 2 x 100 lb bombs, and capturing zones, the OS2U-1 and other scout planes have the added ability to lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilize the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new! With two scout planes one can risk a cap attempt at the beginning of the match, saving the second for any opportunity that presents itself.

== Usage in battles ==

Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought.

If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Alaska is a versatile warrior capable of achieving multiple objectives. However, its generally unwise to spawn Alaska as your first ship (unless you are in a tight squad) and here are the main reasons: First, you have to face the most intense early-game combat and may not spare focus to do multi-tasking. Second, Alaska's low damage output won't help you and your teammate win the early fight. Third, Alaska is tanky indeed but to absorb damage in this ship is the least optimal use and Arizona suits this role much better than her.

After securing the early game, you may spawn Alaska as your second ship and pursue for the mid-late game. Depending on the situation, you may chase down weakened opposing capital ships; sail straight towards one objective and secure the others with your floatplane; repel air raid and deny irregular motorboat tactics with your powerful autocannon arrays. Eventually, you will claim a victory in this ship.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good survivability
* Excellent top speed and manoeuvrable
* Massive amount of AA defenses
* Two scout seaplanes

'''Cons:'''

* Full potential is locked behind high tier modifications (max top speed and floatplanes), stock ship is hardship
* Low damage output, she has difficulties in securing kills
* One deadly weak spot above waterline
