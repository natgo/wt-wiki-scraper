== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was one of two [[Wyoming (Family)|Wyoming-class]] battleships. Laid down in January 1910, she would be commissioned in September 1912 and go on to serve through both World Wars. Notably, she served as part of Battleship Fleet 9, the US Navy attachment to the British Grand Fleet, but would see no action in the First World War. She would provide convoy escorts and shore barrage throughout WW2 before being decommissioned and sunk as part of the Baker nuclear tests.

USS Arkansas was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]]. The sister ship of [[USS Wyoming]], she however comes in a later, 1942 refit. The largest improvement is the anti-aircraft battery, which is greatly improved over the measly {{Annotation|3-inch|76.2 mm}} {{Annotation|HE-TF|High-explosive Time Fused}} battery of the Wyoming. She also gains better torpedo protection at the cost of some speed. With reasonable main battery firepower as well, USS Arkansas serves as a good all-rounder for aspiring US navy captains.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
