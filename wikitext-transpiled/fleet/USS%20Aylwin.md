<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''USS Aylwin (DD-355)''' was a member of the Farragut-class destroyer family, a class of eight 1,365-ton destroyers built by the U.S. Navy following World War I. On April 29, 1916, Congress authorized their construction, along with the [[Porter (Family)|Porter-class destroyers]], but funding was substantially delayed. The USS Aylwin, the third ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for Lieutenant John Cushing Aylwin (1778â€“1812), was laid down at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on September 23, 1933, launched on July 10, 1934, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth M. Farley, Postmaster General James Farley's 11-year-old daughter, and commissioned on March 1, 1935. The ship received 13 combat stars for her service during World War II. After passing the canal for the final time on September 20, 1945, the USS Aylwin arrived in New York City on September 25, 1945. The USS Aylwin was decommissioned on 16 October 1945 at the New York Navy Yard and struck from the Navy List on 1 November 1945. On 20 December 1946, her hull was sold and sent to George N. Nutman, Inc. of Brooklyn, New York, and scrapped by 2 September 1948.

Introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]], the USS Aylwin's firepower exceeds that of the previous Clemson-class destroyers. The fearsome armaments of the USS Aylwin can destroy ships at medium to close range. Unfortunately, due to the relatively low velocity of her guns, players using the USS Aylwin will find it more difficult to land shots at ranges greater than 6 km. At closer ranges, her absence of anti-fragmentation armour significantly harms the ship for being caught in enemy gunfire, as an escape can take time. As a result, the USS Aylwin should use her high rate of fire and powerful weapons at medium range to hold cap zones and assist more protected friends in pressing higher. Furthermore, opponents may be less inclined to attack the USS Aylwin as the anti-air defence is adequate. Nonetheless, air-dropped torpedoes and low-flying bombers flying close to the water's surface must be avoided or prioritised.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The hull of the USS Aylwin has no armour plating, being protected by only the hull, which consists of {{Annotation|0.63 inches|16 mm}} of steel. This provides no protection against any shells larger than a 20 mm gun. Fire from any destroyer calibre or higher guns should be avoided at all costs. The forward magazines are placed low under the waterline and are basically untouchable, however this is not the case for the aft magazine. This is placed directly on the waterline, so any shells exploding above or arcing in a range will easily detonate the ship. It is recommended to avoid fire to the aft of the ship whenever possible. With only 160 crew as well, she also has relatively low survivability in comparison to enemy destroyers, although at least more than the preceding [[USS Aylwin|USS Aylwin]].

None of the turret mounts are enclosed, leaving them incredibly vulnerable to splash damage from {{Annotation|HE|High-Explosive}} shells and direct hits from any calibre of gun. The forward two turrets do at least have gun shields with {{Annotation|0.125 inches|3.175 mm}} of armour, providing slight protection against machine gun and small calibre autocannon fire. The anti-aircraft guns have shields with {{Annotation|0.5 inches|12.7 mm}} of armour, providing slightly more protection but still negligible. In short, essentially any fire is almost guaranteed to destroy any weapon which takes a hit.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

Aylwin has a decent top speed and can cruise to around 60 km/h. It does have a very poor speed change time though, which is to be expected, but this is made up for by its decent ability to dodge shells, when positioned correctly.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)}}

USS Aylwin has a total of 4 x single 5"/38 Mark 12 guns arranged in a balanced manner. These guns are rapid firing compared to earlier destroyers (13 rounds/minute) and have a very quick rate of traverse (25 degrees/second). However, due to low muzzle velocity, it can be difficult to aim at distant targets. Past around 7,000 m the shells will take over 10 seconds to land and tracking shell splashes will be challenging.

Like the other American 5"/38 Mark 12 guns, the Aylwin has the AAC Mark 34 HE shell as stock. The Common Mark 32 SAP and the AAVT Mark 31 HE-VT shells are available as upgrades. Making good use of the VT shell will mean that hostile aircraft stand little chance against you. HE shells will make quick work of light craft such as torpedo boats and sub chasers. HE can also be used against destroyers as they lack armour, while SAP can be used against cruisers with armour protection. Just be aware that at longer ranges and at significant angles, the SAP will be ineffective against armour plating.

Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

Aylwin has access to 8 x 20 mm Oerlikon cannons for her anti-aircraft defences. 2 of them are just forward of the bridge, four of them are just behind the smoke funnels, and the last 2 are just in front of the after main battery mounts. These provide a wide range of fire and can make short work of aircraft that stray too close. They can be effective against hostile torpedo boats, but if these are firing at surface targets, it is highly likely that you will have torpedoes headed your way.

The 20 mm Oerlikon cannon has access to 3 different ammunition belts: Universal, HE, and AP.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.15 (533 mm)|Mk.6 mortar depth charge}}

The torpedo armament on Aylwin is less than the preceding [[Clemson (DD-213)]] but it is more versatile as both of the quadruple 21" (533 mm) launchers are mounted on the centreline amidships. Due to the tight spaces on-board the ship, you do have to give significant broadside to fire the torpedoes, so be aware of your surroundings.

The Aylwin uses the Mk.15 steam turbine torpedo with a default setting of 5,500 m at 45 knots. This can be modified to an extended range of 9,150 m at a reduced speed of 33.5 knots. Each torpedo has a warhead of 224 kg TNT which can make short work of an enemy destroyer providing the hit is not on an extremity. Cruisers may take more than one, but even a single torpedo can be devastating to a larger ship.

Upon unlocking the "Bomb mortar" upgrade, you can equip 4 x Mk.6 depth charges which are projected from mortars. These are positioned near the aft end of the ship, right in line with the No.3 turret. These weapons have an ''extremely'' limited range (only a few hundred metres off each side of the ship) and would only be used during a close-in brawl. Keep in mind that the depth charges do take a few seconds to fly through the air and sink before they detonate, so be aware of timing their firing.

Each Mk.6 depth charge has an explosive charge of 136 kg TNT, which will obliterate any small craft and deal significant damage to a larger ship.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The first US destroyer with five-inch guns, Aylwin is a major upgrade from the [[Clemson (Family)|Clemsons]], boasting one of the best DPMs at her tier. Unfortunately, this comes at the price of a small broadside and a non-existent armour profile. Thus, Aylwin has two roles, depending on game time and preference:

'''Mid-Range Sniping'''

Due to her powerful cannons, Aylwin can decimate ships at medium to close range. Unfortunately, due to her guns having somewhat poor velocity, at ranges exceeding 6,000 km, Aylwin's guns become harder to land shots with. At shorter ranges, her lack of anti-fragmentation armour punishes you for getting caught in enemy cross fire, as retreating can take some time. Hence, at a medium ranges, Aylwin should use her high rate of fire, and powerful guns to lock down cap zones, and support more protected destroyers such as [[Fletcher (Family)|Fletchers]] as they push up. This does not mean that Aylwin cannot cap, but does mean that one must be very mindful of enemy destroyers when using Aylwin, as not getting hit is a vital for this vessel.

'''Support Vessel'''

Especially good when up-tiered or when being used as a second or third spawn, Aylwin's decent(ish) anti-air defence of eight 20 mm cannons is actual quite potent. Though low calibre, their ability to fire almost constantly as well their decent placement makes fighting Aylwin in an aircraft very risky. Naturally this AA is only good at short range, so one must always look out for air dropped torpedoes and low flying bombers, but it can still deter and often destroy even the most potent of attackers. In addition, Aylwin's main battery has a proximity-fused shell that can be researched. As it is radio controlled, it will always burst very near to where your gun distance is set, allowing you to use your high fire rate to tear down aircraft at longer ranges. This firepower can also help deal with short range gun and torpedo boats. As many players tend to bring these light craft in around the end game, when capping gets more fierce and most first spawns are destroyed, sailing into a contested area and letting your 20 mm cannons fire is still a feasible idea. Unfortunately, Aylwin is quite vulnerable to frigates, which the Germans, Japanese and especially Soviets have a lot of, so use your main guns and keep these close range monsters as far away as possible.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Great rate of fire and quick turret traverse
* Agile when fully upgraded
* Anti-aircraft capabilities are great once you combine the rate of fire and turret traverse with VT proximity fuse shells
* 20 mm guns are decent at shooting down planes
* Decent torpedo firing arcs

'''Cons:'''

* 20 mm gun rounds have slow velocity and can be dodged by attentive pilots
* No armour
* Aft guns have no protection; easily disabled or destroyed
* Has a large bridge which is prone to be disabled

The design of the Farragut-class destroyers can be dated back to 1928 when the United States Navy General Board began to outline what the next class of destroyers would look like. As no construction of destroyers had taken place in the United States after the Clemson-class destroyers from 1919-1921, the General Board was able to start from scratch. The idea was to have a destroyer and a destroyer leader, both at 1,500 tons, to serve in flotillas together with one or two of the leaders commanding a group of standard destroyers.<ref name="Friedman1" /> By November of 1930, the concept had changed into a 1,375-ton and 1,500-ton destroyer with a 1,850-ton leader, each using the 5 inch/25 guns as the main armament.<ref name="Friedman2" /> A much heavier torpedo armament was chosen and a change was made for the leader to have a possibility for 5-inch twin mounts, and later the Bureau of Ordnance had developed the 5 inch/38 dual purpose gun which was incorporated into the designs.<ref name="Friedman1" /> Further changes to the designs and addition of ASW equipment meant that by the end of 1931 the design was considered completed. The 1,500-ton design became DD 348-355, the Farragut-class, and the 1,850-ton design became DD 356-363, the Porter-class leaders. In the end, a total of 8 Farragut-class destroyers were built from 1932 to 1935 with the majority of them being commissioned into service in 1935.

USS Aylwin (DD-355) was named after the officer John Cushing Aylwin who had served in the War of 1812. The first assignment for the Aylwin was to tour Europe and she took part in fleet exercises in 1936 and 1937.<ref name="Aylwin" /> On 7 December 1941, Aylwin was sitting in port at Pearl Harbor when Japanese planes flew overhead to begin their attack. Aylwin was one of the first ships to steam out and fire back, and later met up with the Enterprise strike group out at sea the following day.<ref name="Aylwin" /> A few days later the Commander of the ship had congratulated the crew, as only around half of them were on board and they had still carried out all of their tasks without him.<ref name="Aylwin" /> Aylwin would take part in many major engagements throughout the war, such as being with the ANZAC forces in 1942, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign in 1943, the Marianas Islands in 1944 and the invasion of Okinawa in 1945.<ref name="Aylwin" /> She was decommissioned in October 1945 and sold for scrap the following year. USS Aylwin earned 13 Battle Stars for her service in World War II.
