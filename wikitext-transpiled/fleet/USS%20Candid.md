The '''USS Candid''' was a minesweeper of the Admirable class built by the US Navy during World War II, in service between 1943 and 1945. The USS Candid was sent in 1944 to Alaska, to help in convoy escorts and to sweep mines in the area. She also supported the US Army in the Kuril islands and other areas on the north of Japan. The USS Candid also served in the Marshall Islands and the Mariana Islands providing escort services. As part of a secret program, she was transferred to the Soviet Union in 1945 under the designation '''T-283''' and served up until 1958. While the US required the return of most ships sent to the Soviet Union, the USS Candid was never returned and stayed with the USSR until it was removed from Soviet naval registers in 1958. Its fate is still uncertain.

It was introduced in [[Update "Red Skies"]]. The USS Candid works as a gun boat, being relatively large compared to other coastal ships of its rank like the US PT boats. The armour is nothing special, and it has a relatively small crew of 95 sailors, a hit by an enemy plane with a small 500 kg bomb could be enough to destroy the ship, and it is also very vulnerable to cannon fire from aircraft and other boats even without AP belts. However, it is very capable of dealing with other coastal ships, thanks to its powerful armament, a 3 inch Mk 10 cannon, two 40 mm Bofors L/60 cannons, and four 20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II autocannon that are a big threat to enemy aircraft and smaller vessels. The USS Candid works very good defending capture points from smaller but more agile boats, and protecting destroyers and larger ships from aircraft and torpedo boats.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The USS Candid has a poor survivability and armour, while its armour is enough to make it stop 12.7mm HMG in critical areas, it is not enough to stop 40mm autocannon shots, the depth charges are a big weak point, and can cause an explosion in the rear of the vehicle if impacted directly, damaging vehicle propulsion. Its good crew size however, improves survivability against catastrophic explosions and destruction of a particular section.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
In terms of mobility, the USS Candid is quite slow, since it was designed as a minesweeper. It is lighter than a destroyer but heavier than PT boats, however it manages to be slower than all of them, with a top speed of 24KM/h, while most other US ships have top speeds above 30-40KM/h.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}Most important modifications for the USS Candid are the mobility, the 76mm APCBC and HE shells, the smoke curtain and the telemeter, for better target acquisition.

== Armament ==
{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|3-inch Mark 10 (76 mm)}}

The main armament of the USS Candid is its 76mm Mark 10 cannon, with APCBC and HE as its main shells. The HE shells can be used with a time fuse, which increases effectiveness against aircrafts. The only problem is that it only has 1 cannon of this type, which is not the best option to deal with heavier opponents.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)}}

The USS Candid has two 40mm Bofors cannons as its secondary armament, one on each side of the ship and located on the rear. This can be effectively used against lighter ships, like torpedo boats, and cause a lot of damage.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

For Anti-Aircraft armament the USS Candid relies on its 4 x Oerlikon 20mm cannons, although the rest of the armament can also be used for anti aircraft duties. The Oerlikon cannons offer good enough protection against slow aircrafts at close ranges, but are not powerful enough to consistently destroy them at long range, instead, they are better used against scout aircrafts or torpedo bombers flying low and slow.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.6 depth charge|Mk.10 Hedgehog mortar|Mk.6 mortar depth charge}}

The USS Candid lacks torpedoes, which does hamper its ability to engage heavier targets such as destroyers or light cruisers. It does have however depth charges and can be fitted with a Mk.10 ''Hedgehog'' mortar and a MK.6 mortar depth charge, which can be used to some extent against light targets, but are not as effective against heavier cruisers.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The USS Candid is a good support ship, is not the fastest nor the most armed, it has enough armament to deal with torpedo boats and protect more important assets like destroyers or cruisers from light targets. It can also provide decent anti aircraft coverage for the fleet, however it struggles against heavy opponents due to its lack of heavy armament or torpedoes, for that reason, is highly recommended that you stay close to your team and don't engage with the main enemy fleet.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Powerful secondary armament
* Large crew for increased survivability
* Spaced interior which decreases the chances of critical damage
* Good anti aircraft armament for close ranges
* Immune to HMG fire and resistant to 20mm autocannons

'''Cons:'''

* Exposed depth charges which decrease survivability
* No torpedoes
* Poor main armament
* Poor top speed for its BR

The USS Candid was an Admirable-class minesweeper built for the US Navy during World War 2. Commissioned in 1943, the vessel was originally classified as a coastal minesweeper, but was reclassified as a normal minesweeper. It was first deployed in 1944 for duty in the waters of Alaska and called upon to escort convoys and conduct patrols as well as to sweep mines in the area.

She was part of the US attacks on the Kuril Islands in the north of Japan and returned to San Francisco in August of 1944. Two weeks later she participated in operations in the Marshall Islands and the Mariana islands providing escort services in the area and support for the troops in the islands while the region was being developed to facilitate naval and air strikes against the Japanese forces.

In 1945, the USS Candid was transferred to the Soviet Navy, as part of a secret plan to rearm the Soviet Navy in case that the Soviet Union decided to join the war against the Japanese forces alongside the United States. After the completion of the training of Soviet crews, the USS Candid was decommissioned from the US navy and transferred under the Lend Lease program. Under Soviet service, the USS Candid was also classified as minesweeper. In February 1946, when the Cold War was beginning, the USA began negotiations for the return of all those ships loaned to the USSR for use during World War 2. The US Navy was not particularly interested in receiving very old ships that were outmatched by more modern designs, so many American ships were merely administratively returned to the USA and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union. The USS Candid however was never returned, but the US Navy reclassified her as a fleet minesweeper and re-designated her as MSF 154 in 1955. Its destiny is uncertain and it disappeared from Soviet battle registries in 1958.
