== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

{{main|25-mm/87 mk.38 (25 mm)}}

The 25mm/87 Mk.38 is a navalized copy of the ground 25mm M242 cannon (mounted on M3 Bradley) in term of the gun performance and ammo characteristics, though the naval version has its ammo belt slightly re-adjusted with pure HEI-T and APDS belts as researchable modifications. Notice that in naval battles, APDS doesn't create secondary shatters (the spalling in ground battles); it's a pure kinetic-damage ammo. The gun fires at 3 round per second and overheats in 17 seconds. In naval scenarios, APDS is the only option for Cyclone. The self-destroying property of HEI-T renders this type of bullet almost completely useless because boats at this tier and BR often carry punchy 40 mm and above autocannons and fight beyond 2 km.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

There are a pair of 12.7 mm AN-M2 machine guns each mounted on one side of the ship's bridge. Each machine gun only covers a sector less than a quadrant.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The USS Cyclone is a quick vessel fitted with guns that can do short work of most coastal ships it'll encounter. She must stay in the coastal area hunting for them, using her good top speed to her advantage. However, she must stay away from frigates and destroyers that can be encountered at this BR. The 25 mm guns are indeed, very powerful against patrol boats, but they are lacking punch and can hardly significant damages to bigger targets. In addition, the USS Cyclone can hardly withstand a hit from a high-calibre round. Try to engage big vessels while they are already engaged by somebody else or already heavily damaged without overexposing yourself.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very survivable against low-calibre rounds
* APDS rounds have enough penetration to damage other armoured boats, such as MPK.161, HMS Peacock, or M-802
* 25 mm guns are decent against low-flying aircraft
* Decent top speed and mobility
* Has access to a radar system
* APDS rounds have decent velocity and easy to aim even against air targets.

'''Cons:'''

* Large profile
* Guns overheat quickly
* Main guns lack punch against frigates and bigger ships
* High-calibre machine guns have limited fire arc and aren't very effective even against small PT boats
* Can't sustain hits from high-calibre guns (102 mm and above)
* Can't track targets with her radar
