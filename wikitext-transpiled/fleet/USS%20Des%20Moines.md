== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American heavy cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
USS Des Moines, as the lead ship of the [[Des Moines (Family)|Des Moines class]], has an armour layout which is based off the [[Baltimore (Family)|Baltimore class]] heavy cruisers. The main benefit for the main armour belt was to provide protection for the forward magazines, increasing the protection underneath the forward turrets from {{Annotation|0.75 inches|19.05 mm}} to {{Annotation|5.8 inches|147.32 mm}} of armour. The main armour belt is slightly thinner as the [[Baltimore (Family)|Baltimore class]] has a {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} belt, but the extra coverage which the extended belt provides is very welcome. The fore and aft of the citadel are protected by {{Annotation|4.8 inches|121.92 mm}} of bulkhead armour, and thin {{Annotation|0.75-inch|19.05 mm}} bulkheads interspersed throughout the citadel. The decks above the citadel are protected by {{Annotation|1-inch|25.4 mm}} of anti-fragmentation armour just like the destroyers in the US tree. Lower in the ship is a {{Annotation|3.4-inch|86.36 mm}} deck armour plate to deal with incoming fire from long ranges as well; this can deal with other cruisers and lower, however battlecruisers and battleships will easily penetrate this.

Des Moines has excellent armour on the turrets, with {{Annotation|8 inches|203.2 mm}} of armour on the turret face, angled at 34 degrees to provide extra protection. This renders the turret face essentially impervious to any cruiser or destroyer fire, so long as it is facing towards the enemy. The turret sides, with only {{Annotation|3.75 inches|95.25 mm}} of armour, can be penetrated by all cruiser calibre and many destroyer calibre guns at close range. The roof is better protected to defeat plunging fire, with {{Annotation|4 inches|101.6 mm}} of armour. The barbettes have less armour, with {{Annotation|6.1 inches|154.94 mm}} of protection. These will be knocked out regularly by other heavy cruisers and every battleship. These lead into the magazines, and the second turret magazine in particular. It is placed in an exposed position above the waterline unlike the Baltimores, so every precaution should be taken to avoid taking fire to this section. When fighting the Des Moines, this is the recommended area to hit.

Similar to other American cruisers, she lacks torpedo bulges, instead relying on fuel tanks along the hull. These cover the entirety of the hull between the turrets, and can absorb some smaller torpedoes, though most will easily punch through. Captains should watch out for torpedo attacks at all times. If taking a hit is inevitable, manoeuvre the ship so that it takes the hit as close to the front of bow as possible, as the bow is mostly empty space and Des Moines can survive a hit here with just some flooding. Any hits below the turrets, especially the second, should be avoided at all costs.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Possessing a flank speed of {{Annotation|33 kn|61 km/h, 38 mph}}, USS Des Moines has the same top speed as other American heavy cruisers such as the [[USS New Orleans]] or the [[Baltimore (Family)|Baltimore-class]], and slightly faster than the [[Brooklyn (Family)|Brooklyn class]].  This speed allows Des Moines to make it to capture zones and other key locations at a reasonable pace, though not quite as some other cruisers such as [[Voroshilov]]. This speed drops to {{Annotation|23 kn|43 km/h, 27 mph}} in a turn, which although leaving her as an easier target, is still faster than any of the American battleships' flank speeds.

The rudder takes roughly 2 seconds to cause the ship to begin a turn, and while USS Des Moinse is responsive, at essentially 21 tons displacement there is a limit to just how quickly she can turn. Des Moines is agile for a heavy cruiser, but captains will need to be wary when traversing narrow passages as she is unable to make many of the turns that a destroyer or light cruiser could make.
