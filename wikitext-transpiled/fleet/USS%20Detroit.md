== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was laid down in November 1920, and commissioned in July of 1923 as the 5th of 10 [[Omaha (Family)|Omaha-class]] light cruisers. Her original design as a "Scout Cruiser" gave her class a unique armament with forward-facing casemate guns as part of her main battery. She would go on to serve in WW2, the only theater she saw action in being in the Aleutians, bombarding Attu and assisting in the landings. She did however, notably, bring 8 metric tons of gold and 12 metric tons of silver from the submarine USS Trout (which had evacuated it from Corredigor in the Philippines) to the US Treasury in San Francisco. She would serve uneventfully through the rest of WW2, and be sold for scrap in 1946.

Introduced during [[Update "Red Skies"]], USS Detroit was a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season IV, "Fearless Voltigeur"]]. Compared to her sister ship [[USS Trenton]], Detroit is in her 1942 refit, notably gaining access to an anti-aircraft battery of 20 mm Oerlikons in addition to the {{Annotation|1.1-inch|28 mm}}, giving a large boost to the anti-aircraft capabilities. The Omaha-class has a distinct advantage when approaching the enemy bow in: the unique casemate design allows for 4-6 of the {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} guns to be brought to bear whilst also lowering the silhouette of the ship.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|6 inch/53 Mk.12 (152 mm)}}
The one saving grace of this ship is its 6 inch artillery. Powerful enough to obliterate most destroyers in a few well placed hits, it unfortunately has a poor reload rate, and an even worse traverse rate. This vessel is essentially a support ship for more powerful ships in its BR range.

{{:6 inch/53 Mk.12 (152 mm)/Ammunition|6 inch Mk.34 HC, 6 inch Mk.27 SC}}

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|3-inch Mark 10 (76 mm)}}

The 3 inch (76 mm) cannons do have HE-VT shells, meaning that they can ward off planes and ships, but only at close range.

{{:3-inch Mark 10 (76 mm)/Ammunition|76 mm HC Mk.27, 76 mm AP Mk.29, 76 mm HE-VT}}

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|1.1 inch/75 Mk.1 (28 mm)|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

The Detroit is equipped with one Chicago Piano mount and eight single-mount Oerlikon cannons. This provides some decent AA cover at close range, though it certainly isn't winning any awards for defensive firepower. It is better to simply stay close to AA ships and destroyers for some extra protection.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.15 (533 mm)}}

The ship has a pair of torpedo launchers, but their poor placement and poor torpedoes makes them a poor choice to use.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located on the stern are two catapults with one SOC-1 scout plane each which provide unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. Alongside the typical abilities of strafing, dropping 2 x 100 lb bombs, and capping zones, the SOC-1 and other scout planes have the added ability to lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilise the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new! With two scout planes one can risk a cap attempt at the beginning of the match, saving the second for any opportunity that presents itself.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

While using the USS Detroit, try to exploit its mobility advantage and flank around the map. Use cover to make up for the subpar armour of the ship. When playing this ship, make sure you avoid higher-tier cruisers like IJN Mogami, HMS London or Admiral Hipper and go for destroyers and lower-tier cruisers.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Shell rooms are located deep beneath waterline, and rear shell room is also covered by fuel tanks
* All six forward main guns can fire towards bow direction
* Two scout seaplanes
* 76 mm guns have HE-VT shells

'''Cons:'''

* When firing on one broadside, the single-gun turrets draw ammo from shared ready racks, so they maintain fast-firing longer than the twin-gun turrets, resulting in unsynchronized firing pattern
* Poor armour
