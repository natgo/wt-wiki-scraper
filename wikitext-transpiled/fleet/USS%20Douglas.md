== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]]. It has access to guided missiles and a dedicated surface-to-air missile. 

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The PGM-100 suffers from a severe lack of armour, being vulnerable even to small arms fire. As a light coastal vessel, it does not have access to anti-fragmentation armour, with an armour thickness barely surpassing 8 mm. This lack of armour is compensated with an impressive mobility. Due to the superstructure being very tall, it is a primary target for enemy fire, making it easy for all sorts of calibre to heavily damage the Douglas, being able to significantly damage the bridge and leave the ship command-less until it is repaired. The best armour for the Douglas is to remain unseen and hidden, primarily close to rocky locations or against any environmental cover that is big enough to cover the Douglas. A recommendation is to play close or inside cap points, as the RIM-24A Tartar has to be reloaded after both missiles are spent. Staying inside cap points is a high-risk/high-reward tactic. You are able to have a reduced repair time as well as be able to reload all your weapons, but depending on the map, you are a primary target for enemies, especially aircraft. The lack of cover in some maps for specific cap points leaves much to desire. However, as the Douglas is a coastal vessel, it has quick and easy access to at least one cap point inside a better covered area.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Douglas is a pretty agile vessel, featuring a CODOG (Combined Diesel Or Gas) propulsion, making it able to reach high speeds in a quick manner. It has a pretty responsive rudder, even at low speeds. However, sometimes the rudder tends to "stick" when going backwards, making it relatively hard to keep a constant heading while going in reverse. While it is not faster than many of the rest of coastal vessels seen in-game, it certainly has a high endurance and speed for a vessel its size.

{{main|3-inch Mk.34 (76 mm)}}

Like the USS Asheville, the Douglas has access to a 76 mm Mk.34 3-inch autocannon. While it remains uncomparable to better weapon systems like the [[76 mm/62 OTO-Melara Compact (76 mm)|76 mm/62 OTO-Melara Compact]] or the [[76 mm/60 AK-176M (76 mm)|76 mm/60 AK-176M]], it is still a very capable weapon against a wide variety of targets. As it is obvious, the Mk.34 is not meant to be used against heavily-armoured vessels such as destroyers and cruisers. It has very good capabilities to fight off light- to medium-armoured targets, as well as engage all sorts of airborne threats from an effective range of close to 3 km. The rate of fire of the Mk.34 leaves much to expect, but is still a very potent gun. It has 200 ready-rack ammo which can be surprisingly burnt in a fast manner. Targeting speeds are average, crew upgrades are able to significantly increase the traverse of the weapon as well as the elevation.

Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section.

{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

The USS Douglas has access to two twin AN-M2 12.7 mm heavy machine guns. They are useful against lightly-armoured vessels and low flying aircraft, but have little use outside those two target groups.

<!-- ''Mortars, rocket launchers and missiles are also effective in skilled hands and can take an off-guard opponent by surprise. Evaluate the ammunition of this type of armament and rate its performance in combat. If there are no special armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|RIM-24A}}

The USS Douglas has access to the RIM-24A Tartar surface-to-air missile, a beam-riding guided missile. It is the first dedicated ship-launched SAM seen in-game. It has a warhead equivalent to ~50 kg of TNT explosive mass. It is a very powerful missile, capable of destroying any airborne threat with ease and able to destroy even surface combatants. With a speed of 620 m/s and a range of 14 km, it is a fast surface-launched missile with such range, being followed behind by the VT-1 SAM with 1,250 m/s and 12 km range; and Nettuno AShM with 280 m/s and 10 km range. This missile is useful to engage all sorts of airborne threats at stand-off distance, being particularily useful in Naval Enduring Confrontation battles, where fighting enemy aircraft is seen most of the time. The lack of a dedicated search radar makes anti-air duties harder as detection is solely based upon visual contact, but the use of the tracking radar can significantly help with the guidance. As the Tartar is beam-rider (mouse controlled), it can be slaved to the radar track and 'target selection' feature with keybinds, making it very simple to engage all sorts of targets: from small and manoeuvrable to big and sluggish. Despite having a relatively small G-Force limit, since it will be launched at range, the corrections needed to reach a manoeuvring target are minuscule. However, if the target manoeuvres at close range from the missile, it might be hard to successfully hit the target. Since for the targets faced at its battle rating, the awareness and expectations to fight a SAM system is null, this will make it substantially easier to hit targets.

The Tartar can also be used as an anti-ship missile (AShM) if required. The huge explosive mass is more than enough to ammo rack almost any surface vessel, but battleships and specific cruisers. It should be aimed at the waterline, close to a known ammo rack. Most of the time, it is easier to engage the stern ammo racks, as sometimes they are slightly more elevated than bow ones. This is applicable to all US, German and Soviet destroyers, with occasional cases for British and Italians.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Douglas is able to fight off coastal vessels at range thanks to the Mk.34 and the RIM-24A, but it is unable to defend itself at close ranges as it lacks the 40 mm turret the USS Asheville has. However, it is more than capable of keeping up a fight even with the strongest of enemies.

'''When in normal battles:'''

The USS Douglas is a support vessel most of the time with slight frontline capabilities. However, it shines as a full support vessel for both medium and long ranges. The good firepower and access to the incredible RIM-24A combined with the good mobility makes it a very good flanker and support vessel. At all costs close combat should be avoided as all coastal vessels are able to chew through the Douglas with ease due to the increased rate of fire of their armament, something not seen as much with its counterpart USS Asheville as it has the 40 mm turret. The Tartar has the possibility of killing surface vessels under a minimum range of ~2-2.5 km, depending on the terrain. 

'''When in Enduring Confrontation battles:'''

This is where the use of RIM-24A tends to shine much more than in normal battles, mostly because of the variety of targets, tasks and long ranges. The Douglas is very capable of taking out a maximum of two convoy vessels with the Tartar, with possibilities of heavily damaging the enemy carrier if well-placed hits are made. The lack of surface search radar makes it harder to spot and designate enemy aerial targets, but thanks to the tracking radar, once a target is spotted it can be engaged right away. It is particularily useful against long range and high altitude bombers when they are on a run to engage a friendly carrier. These include but are not restricted to: Pe-8, He-117, Yer-2, B-17, He-111, PB4Y-2, etc. The Tartar is also able to be used as a missile defense system. It is able to engage other missiles and dropped ordnance in a similar manner to the AK-630, but at longer ranges with higher efficiency.
