== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the lead ship of the Fargo-class light cruisers, a sub class of the [[USS Cleveland|Cleveland class]]. Laid down in 1943, she wouldn't enter service until December 1945, missing action in World War 2. She served in the Mediterranean fleet after the war, notably serving as flagship for one month of her stint. She was placed in reserve in February 1950, with less than 5 years of service to her name.

Introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]], Fargo is a slight upgrade to the earlier Cleveland. The main advantage is a rearranged superstructure, which gives better coverage for the secondary and anti-aircraft battery. As she was designed late in the war, her anti-aircraft battery is prodigious, with both 40 mm and 20 mm guns covering all angles of the ship. This stronger secondary and anti-aircraft battery comes at the cost of one fewer main calibre turret compared to the [[Brooklyn (Family)|Brooklyn class]]. With a fire rate of 10 rounds per minute (6 seconds), she performs well against cruisers and destroyers.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Fargo class, as a later evolution of the Cleveland-class light cruiser, has a very similar armour layout to the earlier [[USS Cleveland]]. USS Fargo is well armoured for a light cruiser, with a {{Annotation|5-inch|127 mm}} plate angled at 7° to increase effectiveness. This plate, though thin, covers the area from the waterline to the top of the machinery spaces and is resistant to {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} fire at typical engagement ranges, and is almost immune to {{Annotation|5-inch|127 mm}} fire from nearly all ranges. Below the waterline this drops to a {{Annotation|3.25-inch|82.55 mm}} plate, with fuel tanks behind to absorb any shells which manage to pierce the armour below the waterline.

USS Fargo has no access to torpedo protection; this leaves her only torpedo protection as internal bulkheads and the fuel tanks lining the sides of the ship. It is recommended to attempt to avoid torpedoes at all costs, though if a hit is inevitable it is preferable to take the hit amidships, where the fuel tanks have the most coverage.

The armoured deck covering the machinery spaces and citadel has a thickness of {{Annotation|2 inches|50.8 mm}}, as well as the sides of the citadel below the waterline. The turrets are well armoured for a light cruiser, with a face of {{Annotation|6.5 inches|165.1 mm}} angled at 27° making it effective against {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} and lower calibre guns, with the possibility of deflecting some {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} shells at long ranges. The sides and top of the turrets have {{Annotation|3 inches|76.2 mm}} of armour, and the rear only {{Annotation|1.5 inches|38 mm}}. It is recommended to keep the rear of the turrets hidden, as even the 40 mm Bofors can penetrate the rear at close ranges. The turret barbettes have {{Annotation|6 inches|152.4 mm}} of armour, and these lead all the way down to the magazines.

The magazines are placed far down in the ship well below the waterline, above fuel tanks in the bow and between them in the stern. These are very unlikely to be hit by enemy shells in these positions, but captains should be vigilant in preventing a torpedo strike in these two areas, as any torpedo hit will easily be fatal to the ship, especially in the bow with no fuel tanks to cushion the blast on either side.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The USS Fargo makes a top speed of {{Annotation|32.4 kn|60 km/h;37.2 mph}} once upgraded, the same as the earlier [[USS Cleveland]]. As with other American cruisers, this gives Fargo the capability to take objectives and crucial areas of the map that slower cruisers, and of course battleships, may not be capable of. It takes approximately 38 seconds to reach flank speed, and Fargo will halt from flank in roughly 1 minute. The rudder takes about 2 seconds to respond, and as Fargo uses a single rudder design, the turning circle is fairly wide. Captains are advised to avoid terrain where sharp turns are necessary, as USS Fargo may be unable to perform such manoeuvres without running aground. Speed will fall to {{Annotation|23 kn|42 km/h;26 mph}} in a sustained turn; this will make Fargo a much easier target and captains are advised to avoid prolonged, aggressive manoeuvres as this will drain vital speed.

Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|6 inch/47 Mk.16 (152 mm)}}

USS Fargo has 12 x {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} guns as her main battery, split into 4 x triple turrets, mounted 2 fore and 2 aft. The gun mounts have a horizontal targeting speed of 10° per second, which is very quick for a cruiser and better even than some destroyers. This gives Fargo quick reaction times against unexpected threats and allows her to perform well in close quarters engagements. The reload time is excellent at 6 seconds with an aced crew, like other American {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} armed ships like the preceding [[USS Cleveland]]. This fast reload rate allows Fargo to quickly send large quantities of shells downrange from her main battery.

USS Fargo has access to 4 types of shells: the HE round Mk.34 HC, the APCBC round Mk. 35 AP, the HE round Mk.34 HC (base fuse) and the HE-VT round Mk.34 HC-VT. She has no access to SAP unlike other cruisers of her rank.

The HE round Mk.34 HC serves as the stock round for the USS Fargo, and the high filler of 5.88 kg TNTeq will do appreciable damage, especially in the high quantities the fast fire rate and plentiful guns allow. This shell will easily dispatch destroyers and lightly-armoured light cruisers, but begins to have a more difficult time against late war light cruisers with improved armour and of course, heavy cruisers and battleships. Against capital ships the shell will be ineffective, but capable of destroying AA and secondary mounts and setting fire to the superstructure. The HE round Mk.34 HC (base fuse) and the HE-VT round Mk.34 HC-VT are the same shell but with different fuses, hence the names.

The Mk.34 HC (base fuse) has the fuse at the bottom of the shell instead of in the nose, which allows it to penetrate into the armour before exploding. This gives it a small amount of extra penetration with the same filler. The Mk.34 HC-VT has a proximity fuse, allowing it to detonate when close to enemy aircraft and serve as long range AA fire to supplement the AA battery. This is the primary HE round recommended for use, as it functions identically to the normal Mk.34 shell while being able to destroy aircraft, and the slight extra penetration of the base fuse shell is not typically helpful.

The final shell is the APCBC round Mk.35 AP, the primary shell for use against more heavily-armoured targets like the [[Prinz Eugen]] which are commonly seen. The shell has good penetration, but is slightly lacking in filler for its calibre. This is made up for with the heavy volumes of fire the quick reload rate allows, and captains can expect quick damage to internal components and crew, oftentimes leaving enemy captains with little or no time to retaliate if caught off guard. It is recommended to aim for magazines if possible due to the low quantities of filler in the shells, though it's not a major concern with the sufficient rate of fire.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)}}

USS Fargo's secondary battery consists of 12 x {{Annotation|5-inch|127mm}}/38 guns, mounted in 6 twin turrets. These are positioned with one each fore and aft of the superstructure, and 4 more positioned in wing-mounted pairs, port and starboard of the bridge and superstructure. This gives an 8 gun broadside for the secondary battery, with the full 12 being available only for enemy aircraft high above the ship. These guns will already be familiar to captains, as they make up the primary battery of most destroyers in the American bluewater fleet. The guns have excellent rate of fire and high traverse speeds, and as they are designed to be dual purpose, they work well against both air and surface targets.

The AAC Mk.34 serves as the stock shell, a basic HE shell with 3.22 kg TNTe. This will work well against vessels with little or no armour such as early destroyers or PT boats, but for high rank destroyers and cruisers, the SP Common is recommended. The SP Common shell works well against destroyers and light cruisers, being able to penetrate their armour at battle range and the 906.5 g TNTe will do appreciable damage upon penetration. The final shell is the Mk.31 AAVT shell, with the same filler as the HE shell but with a proximity fuse. This is the multipurpose shell of choice, as it is both excellent for destroying aircraft, with a 23 m trigger radius, and performs identically to the HE shell against lightly armoured targets. It is recommended for captains of USS Fargo to run a mixture of AAVT and SP Common shells to allow for rapid response to differing threats.

The {{PAGENAME}} is devastating in downtiers. Her rapid-firing 6-inch and 5-inch guns have excellent damage output with their HE shells, which will rip apart destroyers in a few salvos and wear down the crew of cruisers in minutes. Her survivability is also good for a light cruiser, with decent armour, well-placed magazines, and a moderately sized crew, which will allow her to hold her own against same- or lower-tiered ships and last long enough to get behind cover when facing heavy cruisers and battleships. The {{PAGENAME}} is no heavy cruiser though, so bringing her into open waters against multiple enemies is dangerous unless there are teammates around to divert enemy fire.

Conversely, the {{PAGENAME}} will struggle in uptiers. Her AP shells have relatively poor penetration and low explosive filler, which means that they won't do much damage unless hitting critical components like ammo racks or engine rooms, and they are completely ineffective against top-tier battleships and battlecruisers. In this case, finding cover is even more critical. The {{PAGENAME}} should hide among the hills in shallower waters and take out softer targets for the team. She also has radar and HE-VT shells in all guns, so she can protect teammates who lack AA armaments by taking out enemy aircraft from long range.

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent firepower against less armored enemies
** Fast firing primary and secondary armament
** Base fuse HE does good damage upon penetration and can still effectively damage the exposed components of better armored ships
* Good survivability for a light cruiser
* Has radar (with lead calculation) and HE-VT shells, very effective against air targets
* Adequate mobility, helps moving in and out of cover quickly

'''Cons:'''

* AP shells are mostly ineffective in uptiers
* AP shells have low explosive filler
* Lacks SAP shells, which can be a problem when meeting moderately armored opponents that the HE shells can't penetrate and the AP shells do too little damage
* Armor is non-existent in uptiers
