== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was laid down in May of 1944, and commissioned in December 1944. She would see limited service in WW2, acting as a radar picket destroyer in the Battle for Okinawa. She would also be present for the Surrender in Tokyo Bay in 1945. She would be reclassified as a radar picket destroyer (DDR-742) in March of 1946, and would go on to serve in the Korean war in this role, notably taking part in the Inchon invasion. She would also see action in Vietnam providing gunfire support. She would be transferred to the Greek navy in 1971, and would see service until the early 1990s before being sunk as a torpedo target by the Greek submarine Nireus on the 12th of September 2001.

USS Frank Knox was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]], and compared to the other US Bluewater rank III premium [[USS Moffett]], has both benefits and downsides. It does have a weaker main battery, with only 6 {{Annotation|5-inch|127 mm}} guns in the main battery. In exchange, it has a larger crew count and better anti-fragmentation armour, a much better anti-aircraft suite and 2 extra torpedoes as well (10 instead of 8). It can easily deal with most destroyers of the rank with its rapid fire guns, and is also excellent for anti-air duties, even having radar for engaging air targets. Additionally, Frank Knox has an exceptionally high Silver Lion multiplier of 5.85, giving a multiplier of 1755% with premium time.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
USS Frank Knox has the same armour layout as the [[USS Gearing]], the lead ship of the [[Gearing (Family)|Gearing class]]. This means she has a main belt of {{Annotation|0.75 inches|19 mm}}, which is surprisingly well armoured for a destroyer of this rank. This is more than the {{Annotation|0.5 inches|12.7 mm}} of the [[Porter (Family)|Porter class]] and the same as the earlier [[Fletcher (Family)|Fletcher class]]. This belt cannot stop more than 20 mm autocannons, but it significantly lessens spall damage from HE shells from other destroyers and light cruisers. The dual turret mounts have {{Annotation|0.125 inches|3.175 mm}} of armour on the front, sides, rear, and top, and there is a {{Annotation|0.5-inch|13 mm}} deck armour plate covering the machinery spaces.

The magazine is placed under the aft turret, and is protected by fuel tanks on both sides of the hull. These fuel tanks will protect the magazine from high explosive shells, but any SAP or AP will slice straight through and ammorack the ship. Captains of USS Frank Knox should avoid taking hits to the stern of the ship whenever possible, and evasive action is recommended as any direct hit under the aft turret will most likely result in total loss of the ship.

As for crew count, USS Frank Knox is quite well off. With a crew count of 336, Frank Knox is able to lose more crew members and keep fighting in comparison to her older [[Porter (Family)|Porter-class]] and [[Fletcher (Family)|Fletcher-class]] predecessors, allowing her to stay in the fight for longer. This can allow captains of USS Frank Knox to serve as a flotilla leader and absorb shots in some situations, although as stated before it is not recommended to do so while the stern is within the line of fire.

The primary battery has enough armour to stop some spall damage from misses with high explosive shells, but any direct hit from any destroyer calibre gun or higher will inevitably knock the mount out of action. The secondary battery has no armour whatsoever, and splash from hits or near misses will commonly damage or destroy the battery. It is recommended to avoid repairing these whenever possible, as they will inevitably be destroyed again and drain more crew from the ship.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
USS Frank Knox, as a member of the [[Gearing (Family)|Gearing-class]], has very similar performance to [[USS Gearing]] and the [[USS Sumner]] her class was derived from. This gives her quick acceleration, only taking approximately 25 seconds to reach her flank speed of {{Annotation|34 kn|64 km/h;40 mph}} from a standstill. The rudder responds within 1 second, and speed will fall to {{Annotation|24.0 kn|45 km/h;27.7 mph}} in a sustained turn, so captains of USS Frank Knox are advised to avoid long sweeping turns as much as possible, as these slow the ship massively and can make it a much easier target. The Frank Knox takes approximately 35 seconds to come to a halt after the order has been given, and overall the ship performs well and is responsive, particularly at lower speeds.

{{main|5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)}}

The primary armament of the USS Frank Knox is 6 x {{Annotation|5-inch|127mm}}/38 Mk.12 in three twin mounts, two superfiring forward and one aft, directly above the magazine. The {{Annotation|5-inch|127mm}}/38 has a very high rate of fire, with 22 rounds/min (2.8-second reload) with a maxed reload and a still respectable 15 round/min (4-second reload) once the ready rack is depleted. This gives the USS Frank Knox excellent volume of fire compared to other nation's contemporary destroyers, while still having shells with good damage and penetration.

The USS Frank Knox gets access to four shell types - AAC Mk.34, Common Mk.32, SP Common Mk.46, and AAVT Mk.31. As the Frank Knox is a premium, captains will have all four shell types unlocked immediately. Therefore it is recommend to run two shell types, about 1/3 ammo load AAVT Mk.31 and 2/3 Common Mk.32. The AAVT shell has the same quantity of explosive filler as the AAC shell, and performs identically against surface targets whilst having a proximity fuse for use against air targets. The Common shell is recommended over the SP Common shell due to the greater quantity of filler in the shells compared to the SP Common shells, and the lower penetration isn't a concern against the destroyers of the rank. If captains find themselves fighting cruisers, the SP Common shell with its higher penetration is recommended.

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 1 (40 mm)|Bofors L/60 Mark 2 (40 mm)}}

USS Frank Knox has a strong secondary battery for a destroyer, consisting of 12 x 40 mm Bofors cannons, split into 2 x quad mounts and 2 x dual mounts. The quad mounts are positioned aft of the second funnel, with one positioned facing starboard closer to the funnel and the other positioned to port further aft. The dual mounts are positioned aft of the bride before the first funnel, and are positioned symmetrically port and starboard. This secondary battery is the second strongest of the American destroyers, only surpassed by [[USS Gearing]] of the same class.

USS Frank Knox has three belts:

* '''Universal:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}
* '''40 mm HE clips:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}
* '''40 mm AP clips:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}

Of these, Universal serves as the default belt. With half HE and half AP, this belt serves as a good dual purpose belt, and will shred any aircraft or lightly armoured destroyer, or smaller vessel. This belt will serve well in most situations and should be run if the captain wishes for a balanced close range defense.

40 mm HE clips works well for captains more concerned with air attack, as the higher density of HE shells in the belt will destroy enemy aircraft slightly more quickly than the Universal belt will. It still has one AP shell every four rounds so it is still capable of destroying surface targets, but if they are the largest concern the 40 mm AP belt will be the best option.

The 40 mm AP belt is optimized for surface engagements, with 3 AP shells in every 4 in the clip. As before, there is some HE but the belt is heavily optimized for surface engagements. This allows the Frank Knox to use its 12 x 40 mm cannons to damage destroyers and destroy coastal vessels with ease.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

USS Frank Knox has 11 x single mount 20 mm Oerlikon Mk.II cannons for its anti-aircraft battery. 4 are positioned near the bridge, 2 port and 2 starboard. Two more are positioned on the port side of the second funnel, with another pair positioned forward of the aft torpedo launcher, on the starboard side. The final three are positioned aft of the rear turret, in a triangle. The Oerlikon was one of the standard mid-to-late war anti-aircraft guns, and has good fire rate, traverse and reload speed, one of the best small anti-aircraft guns of the war. Captains can expect these to shred any plane within about 1.5 km, and they will serve to deter or destroy any aircraft which has made it past the medium anti-aircraft battery, though they should not be expected to be capable of destroying targets before weapons release.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.15 (533 mm)|Mk.6 mortar depth charge}}

USS Frank Knox, as a destroyer, carries torpedoes for use against heavier vessels. These come in two quintuple launchers, one in between the two funnels, and one aft, forward of the rear turret. These carry the American Mk.15 torpedo, with {{Annotation|5.5 km|3.4 miles}} of range stock, and a speed of {{Annotation|45 kn|83 km/h;52 mph}}. Once the "Torpedo mode" modification is selected, the range increases to {{Annotation|9.15 km|5.7 miles}}, but the speed drops sharply to {{Annotation|33 kn|62 km/h;39 mph}}. With the limited range of US torpedoes, in most cases it is recommended not to run the extra range, as the extra speed and a close launch are a more reliable way to guarantee hits.

Additionally, USS Frank Knox carries 24 x Mk.6 depth charges. These were intended for use against submarines, captains should expect very limited use against surface vessels. These can sometimes be used against PT boats which have gotten too close, or landing some on the deck of enemy ships in very close encounters, but overall they will play very little role in most engagements.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
USS Frank Knox plays similarly to other American destroyers of this rank: fast, hard hitting and aggressive. Unlike destroyers of other nations, American destroyers are armed with the {{Annotation|5-inch|127 mm}}/38 dual-purpose cannon, with a very fast fire rate and good damage. Frank Knox has 6 of these cannons, and this allows her to rapidly dish out punishment against any lightly armoured vessel in the vicinity. Captains are advised to drop a spread of torpedoes in the path of heavier vessels, and then proceed to close the range with enemy destroyers. The {{Annotation|0.75-inch|19 mm}} armour belt of anti-fragmentation armour will help lessen damage from HE shells, and the ship has a high crew count for a destroyer as well. This means the Frank Knox works well brawling, especially against destroyers with no SAP shells for their primary weapon. USS Frank Knox does exceptionally well at quickly dispatching enemy destroyers, as the main battery's high fire rate allows for high amounts of damage in a short period of time, and the Bofors secondary battery is quite the hefty backup. In mixed battles, the [[USS Moffett]] will be the most common vessel seen; it is recommended to shoot under the aft two turrets: the magazine is located here and this will ammorack the enemy destroyer in a single hit if detonated. This weakspot also works against most other American destroyers, including USS Frank Knox. Captains of USS Frank Knox are advised to hide the rear magazine whenever possible, using terrain if able.
