== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
USS Gearing, as a late war US destroyer, has very good armour in comparison to destroyers from other nations. This takes the shape of a main armour belt consisting of {{Annotation|0.75 inches|19 mm}} of anti-fragmentation armour. While being unable to stop any fire from other destroyer or cruiser guns such as the commonly found {{Annotation|5-6 inch|127-152 mm}}, it will still drastically reduce the damage done to the internals of the ship from high-explosive shells. This greatly increases the survivability of the ship, especially against Japanese ships such as the [[IJN Shimakaze]] which have no access to any form of {{Annotation|SAP|Semi-Armour Piercing}} or {{Annotation|AP|Armour Piercing}}. The top of the machinery spaces are covered by a layer of {{Annotation|0.5-inch|13 mm}} armour as well, protecting against shrapnel from shells landing higher in the ship. This, in combination with the respectable crew of 336 members, gives her good survivability, some of the best of the USN destroyers, surpassed only by the [[USS Sumner]] and [[Mitscher (Family)| Mitscher-class]] destroyers.

The dual mounts, similar to other US destroyers, were designed as dual-purpose, and were therefore unable to be protected by thick armour as this would slow turret traverse. This means the turrets are only lightly covered by {{Annotation|0.125-inch|3.175 mm}} anti-fragmentation armour. Any direct hit from anything larger than a 20 mm will almost definitely knock out the turret, although at least near misses will leave the turret unharmed or with only slight damage.

However, the USS Gearing still has one of the issues left over from earlier US destroyers: the rear magazine being elevated near the waterline. This was a necessity to allow room for the propeller shafts in the stern of the ship, but still can have rather explosive consequences. The issue has been alleviated somewhat compared to the earlier [[Porter (Family)|Porter-class]] which are infamous for how easily they are destroyed via this area, but captains should still be wary and avoid fire to the aft of the ship whenever possible.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The mobility of the USS Gearing is typical of most American destroyers, meaning that it accelerates quickly, turns surprisingly well, and can switch to reverse in a short amount of time. The overall top speed is competitive at its BR, but will still be beaten by the likes of the [[Z25]] or Soviet destroyers such as the [[Leningrad]].

{{Specs-Fleet-Armaments}}
=== Primary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)}}

The 5-inch guns of the USS Gearing are the same as on other American destroyers, with their fast fire rate and access to both SAP shells and proximity-fused shells. Unlike the destroyers [[USS Somers]] or [[USS Porter]], the USS Gearing only has 3 twin turrets instead of 4, thus resulting in 25% less main calibre firepower.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 1 (40 mm)|Bofors L/60 Mark 2 (40 mm)}}

The USS Gearing has a very strong secondary armament, with a total of 16 x 40 mm Bofors cannons that can completely shred any aircraft at medium range and obliterate any small boat that would come too close. These cannons can also make quick work of exposed modules on destroyers at close range. Compared to other [[Gearing (Family)|Gearing-class]] destroyers, USS Gearing is in her 1945 fit. As enemy air attack was more of a threat, one of the quintuple torpedo launchers was replaced with a quadruple 40 mm Bofors mount, giving her a much more substantial medium anti-aircraft battery, the most of any other American bluewater destroyer.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

The short range AA of the USS Gearing is made up of no less than 11 x 20 mm Oerlikon autocannons. These can quickly handle most close range threats, but their range is limited, so if they start firing then look out for closing threats.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mk.6 mortar depth charge|Mk.15 (533 mm)}}

The USS Gearing is capable of carrying both 10 x 533 mm Mk.15 Torpedoes and 24 x Mk.6 depth charges. The torpedoes are effective at close range with a powerful warhead consisting of 224 kg of TNT, however their limited range of 5.50 km (9.15 km with Torpedo Mode) can limit their utility on larger maps prevalent at higher BRs.

The depth charges are dropped from the back of the ship and as such are only useful in the event of an opponent being directly behind the ship. This is a very rare event even at low BRs so carrying these exposed drums of TNT is not recommended.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The USS Gearing can be played aggressively as the fast firing 5-inch guns and powerful 40 mm cannons can shred most opponents with ease and the large crew count allows for punishment to be taken in return. It is recommended to release torpedoes early in the match to prevent them from being detonated later in the match.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Very powerful close and medium AA armament
* Large crew complement for a destroyer for longer survivability
* Fast firing 5-inch guns
* Good antifragmentation armour

'''Cons:'''

* Torpedoes have a relatively short range even with torpedo mode activated
* Only 6 main guns, compared to most American destroyers with 8
* Can be easily destroyed by an ammo rack detonation caused by SAP and APHE shots

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
'''Design and Construction'''

Design work of the Gearing class started with the preceding Sumner class, which were themselves a modified Fletcher incorporating the new twin high angle twin mounts for the 5"/38 calbre guns. The Gearing design mainly evolves from the Sumner by increasing the length of the hull by 4.3 metres, allowing greater fuel storage and therefore increased range. The higher beam to length ratio also increased the top speed, most of the ships in the class achieving 36 knots. USS Gearing herself was commissioned on May 3rd 1945.

'''FRAM I Upgrades'''

During the 1960s, USS Gearing received the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) 1 upgrades. This converted the Gearing from a primarily anti-aircraft destroyer into a dedicated anti-submarine warfare destroyer. Modifications include the new advanced sonar, the ASROC anti-submarine torpedo launcher (also capable of launching nuclear depth charges), the Mk.44 torpedo and the DASH anti-submarine helicopter which had a range of 35 km as well as the hangar and facilities needed to maintain it.

'''Service History'''

USS Gearing was commissioned a few months before the end of WW2 and trained crews for other destroyers until early October 1945. Her immediate postwar career was spent in peacetime operations on the Atlantic side of the Americas before sailing into the Mediterranean in 1947 until 1948. Gearing would then operate around the Caribbean before taking part in Operation Frostbite, sailing into the Arctic to test and develop cold water techniques and equipment before returning to operate in the Caribbean and Mediterranean until 1961 when she took part in the negotiations for the Santa Maria hijacking. In the following year, Gearing would take part in the blockade of Cuba before moving on to operate in the Atlantic when diplomatic negotiation ended the crisis. After receiving the FRAM I upgrades she would continue her normal operations.

USS Gearing would be decommissioned in 1973 and then sold for scrap the following year.
