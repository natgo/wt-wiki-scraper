<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''USS Mitscher (DL-2/DDG-35)''' one of the experimental destroyers of the Mitscher class built for the United States Navy immediately after World War II. Originally designated DD-927, she was laid down on 3 October 1949 by the Bath Iron Works Corporation in Bath, Maine, then reclassified as a lead ship for a new destroyer class on 2 February 1951. The ship was named after Admiral Marc "Pete" Mitscher and was launched on January 26, 1952, by Mrs Marc A. Mitscher, Admiral Mitscher's widow, and commissioned on May 15, 1953. Between 18 March 1966 and 29 June 1968, she was modified to a guided missile destroyer and designated DDG-35, serving until 1978. On 1 June 1978, the USS Mitscher was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and it was scrapped in July 1980.

Introduced in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]], the USS Mitscher is a unique destroyer with fewer gun platforms than prior destroyers but increased lethality. The two 127 mm/54 Mark 18 guns are positioned in a single turret in the bow and stern. The main turrets may be fully traversed, providing excellent coverage. While the ship has only two main guns, which severely limits its burst damage and accuracy when compared to other 127 mm guns, these weaknesses are offset by an extremely fast rate of fire of 40 shells per minute, allowing the USS Mitscher to deal a similar continuous damage output as other destroyers in her rank. Furthermore, the shells fired by the USS Mitscher are heavier and more potent in terms of penetration and explosive content than 127 mm shells from World War II. However, with only two gun mounts, its efficacy is severely hindered if one of these turrets is disabled.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Built during the early Cold War to serve as a "Destroyer leader" to be armed with various armaments for different targets, the Mitscher is unusually large. At a whopping 150 m in length and over 4,800 tons of displacement, she even dwarfs the Japanese experimental cruiser [[IJN Yubari|Yubari]] and has a size closer to that of light cruisers.

The Mitscher is barely armoured. The ship only has thin armour to protect the two cannon turrets and a gun shield for Oerlikon autocannons, the ship will attract incoming fire from all gun calibres and take full damage. Her internal modules are unprotected and can be easily damaged, especially her rocket ammo racks that can be easily detonated due to lack of protection.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Being a destroyer, the Mitscher is reasonably fast and manoeuvrable, though her large displacement for her class and long length limit her acceleration and agility.

{{Specs-Fleet-Primary}}
<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|127 mm/54 Mark 18 (127 mm)}}

The main armament for the Mitscher is two 127 mm/54 Mark 18 autocannons mounted in a single turret at the bow and stern. The main turrets can be fully traversed over 360 degrees and consequently have very good coverage. While there are only two main guns for the ship, which severely limits its burst damage, and has notably worse accuracy compared with other 127 mm guns, these weaknesses are compensated by an extremely fast rate of fire of 40 shells per minute, and thus allows the Mitscher to deal a similar continuous damage output as other destroyers at her BR range. Moreover, the shells fired by the Mitscher are heavier and more powerful than WW2-era 127 mm shells in terms of both penetration and explosive filler.

The Mitscher has three type of shells; an HE shell with similar damage output to other American destroyers, an SAP shell with very good penetration of 156 mm at 5,000 m that is capable of damaging enemy cruisers, and an HE-VT shell that is very useful for engaging aircraft thanks to the gun's wide coverage and fast reload, especially when used with the anti-air radar that the Mitscher is equipped with.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|3-inch Mk.34 (76 mm)}}

The Mitscher also has four rapid firing 3-inch guns, placed in two turrets, that provide valuable supplementary firepower. However, the small calibre causes them to lose accuracy over long ranges, which, coupled with their tendency to slowly overheat, means that they are best used in close-range melees to help quickly eliminate threats. The HE-VT shell has less explosive filler than the regular HE shell, so captains should evaluate which one to use as their primary shell, depending on whether they want to focus more on surface or aerial threats

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|20 mm/70 Oerlikon Mk.II (20 mm)}}

With only four 20 mm Oerlikons, the Mitscher's dedicated anti-aircraft armament is quite average for its BR. Although useful as a last line of defense, in most cases these AA guns will only destroy enemy planes after they have dropped their weapons. It's much more advisable to keep an eye on the radar and eliminate aerial threats with the main guns from long range instead.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mark 35 (533 mm)|Mark 108 Weapon alfa}}

The Mitscher can be equipped with four 533 mm Mark 35 torpedoes in fixed mounts. These torpedoes are not powerful compared to contemporary torpedoes, nor are they particularly fast, but still retain sufficient explosive power at the Mitscher's battle rating. The primary limiting factor for these torpedoes are the fixed firing mounts, which means these torpedoes cannot be used with the same level of utility as on other destroyers.

The Mitscher also has access to two 320 mm Alfa antisubmarine rocket launchers. These rockets are very powerful, with an explosive mass of 113 kg of TNT, but are heavily limited by a range of 600 m. These mounts have very exposed ammunition storages, which deal a significant amount of damage to the Mitscher when detonated. However, the relatively high crew count and large size of the Mitscher means that the damage inflicted by a detonation of these rockets will not critically damage or wholly incapacitate the ship. Overall, the Alfa antisubmarine rockets are not recommended in general, but can be taken in some close-range maps.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Despite her post-war main guns, the Mitscher still has the lowest damage output among other US destroyers at this BR, especially at long ranges, in which case the [[USS Gearing]] and [[USS Sumner]] would be better choices. Nevertheless, she is an excellent support vessel and overall a fun ship to play with. Stay behind cover or teammates and help eliminate targets that they may have trouble dealing with. Her fast rangefinder allows the Mitscher to deal with agile vessels like torpedo boats with more ease, and her radar and HE-VT shells will keep the skies clear. Even if forced into combat with other bluewater ships, the Mitscher can still hold her own with her large crew count and very high-penetrating SAP shells.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
