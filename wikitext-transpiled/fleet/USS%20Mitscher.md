== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Built during the early Cold War to serve as a "Destroyer leader" to be armed with various armaments for different targets, the Mitscher is unusually large. At a whopping 150 m in length and over 4,800 tons of displacement, she even dwarfs the Japanese experimental cruiser [[IJN Yubari|Yubari]] and has a size closer to that of light cruisers.

The Mitscher is barely armoured. The ship only has thin armour to protect the two cannon turrets and a gun shield for Oerlikon autocannons, the ship will attract incoming fire from all gun calibres and take full damage. Her internal modules are unprotected and can be easily damaged, especially her rocket ammo racks that can be easily detonated due to lack of protection.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Being a destroyer, the Mitscher is reasonably fast and manoeuvrable, though her large displacement for her class and long length limit her acceleration and agility.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|127 mm/54 Mark 18 (127 mm)}}

The main armament for the Mitscher is two 127 mm/54 Mark 18 autocannons mounted in a single turret at the bow and stern. The main turrets can be fully traversed over 360 degrees and consequently have very good coverage. While there are only two main guns for the ship, which severely limits its burst damage, and has notably worse accuracy compared with other 127 mm guns, these weaknesses are compensated by an extremely fast rate of fire of 40 shells per minute, and thus allows the Mischer to deal a similar continuous damage output as other destroyers at her BR range. Moreover, the shells fired by the Mitscher are heavier and more powerful than WW2-era 127 mm shells in terms of both penetration and explosive filler.

The Mitscher has three type of shells; an HE shell with similar damage output to other American destroyers, an SAP shell with very good penetration of 156 mm at 5,000 m that is capable of damaging enemy cruisers, and an HE-VT shell that is very useful for engaging aircraft thanks to the gun's wide coverage and fast reload, especially when used with the anti-air radar that the Mitscher is equipped with.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|Mark 35 (533 mm)|Mark 108 Weapon alfa}}

The Mitscher can be equipped with four 533 mm Mark 35 torpedoes in fixed mounts. These torpedoes are not powerful compared to contemporary torpedoes, nor are they particularly fast, but still retain sufficient explosive power at the Mitscher's battle rating. The primary limiting factor for these torpedoes are the fixed firing mounts, which means these torpedoes cannot be used with the same level of utility as on other destroyers.

The Mitscher also has access to two 320 mm Alfa antisubmarine rocket launchers. These rockets are very powerful, with an explosive mass of 113 kg of TNT, but are heavily limited by a range of 600 m. These mounts have very exposed ammunition storages, which deal a significant amount of damage to the Mitscher when detonated. However, the relatively high crew count and large size of the Mitscher means that the damage inflicted by a detonation of these rockets will not critically damage or wholly incapacitate the ship. Overall, the Alfa antisubmarine rockets are not recommended in general, but can be taken in some close-range maps.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Rapid-firing 127 mm autocannons capable of delivering continuous damage
* Main turrets have good coverage and is fully traversable
* Wide range of autocannons to deal against surface and aerial targets
* Rockets can prove devastating at close range

'''Cons:'''

* The largest destroyer in the game, with the size of a light cruiser, can be easily targeted
* Only two main guns, its effectiveness is significantly decreased when one or both is disabled
* Very poor burst damage
* Rocket ammo racks can be easily detonated
* Fixed torpedoes mean ship has to be manoeuvred to aim
