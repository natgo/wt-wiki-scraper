== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American heavy cruiser {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8021-event-winter-quest-en|2022 Winter Quest]] event.

The Des Moines-class heavy cruiser is the final evolution of the "all-gun" American cruiser. Being largely based on the [[Baltimore (Family)|Baltimore-class]] heavy cruiser, the Des Moines-class retains the same layout with several optimization and improvement, most notably the introduction of an autoloading mechanism for her {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} guns, doubling its rate of fire. However, as they were completed during the dawn of the jet and missile age, they were largely reduced to a fleet carrier escort. By the year 1961, two out of three ship of the class were already decommissioned.

The {{PAGENAME}}, the third and final Des Moines-class, is the sole active ship of the class during the outbreak of the Vietnam War. After being converted into a flagship cruiser in 1962, she was deployed in a bombardment roles off the coast of Vietnam. In 1972, she suffered a gun breech explosion and deemed too expensive to repair, resulting into her decommission three years later.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Newport News is a Des Moines-class heavy cruiser. This heavy cruiser class is a further development of the Baltimore class, and as such, is decently armoured just like its predecessor. The most noticeable difference is that the 6" (152 mm) main belt has been extended to cover the main battery turrets. There are also several 5" (127 mm) bulkheads dividing the citadel into sections, which will help isolating damage in engine and ammunition compartments. While she lacks any anti-fragmentation armour to protect her deck from HE shell, this is compensated by the placement of some of her crew compartments deep into the hull, thus protecting her crew from external damage in the process.

Her main battery turrets are armoured similarly to those on Baltimore-class cruisers. Compared to the older turrets, these have slightly thicker armour on the sides and the roof. However, they are significantly larger than the older turrets, and may receive more hits as a result.

Compared to those found on Baltimore-class cruisers, her main battery barbettes have less area consisting of shells. However, she has a big weakness - the magazine of her second turret extends above the waterline. A penetrating hit under her second turret can be devastating.

Like other American cruisers, she lacks meaningful torpedo defence. Captains should watch out for torpedo attacks at all times. If taking a hit is inevitable, try to manoeuvre the ship so that it takes the hit as close to the bow as possible, since most of the bow is empty space and you can survive with just some flooding. Whatever you do, keep the torpedo from hitting below any main turret.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Newport News is very large and heavy, even for a heavy cruiser. The ship is over 213 meters long at the waterline and weighs close to 21,000 tons in displacement. Because of this, her mobility is noticeably worse than the previous Baltimore-class, being somewhat sluggish to manoeuvre and control, especially when stock. When fully upgraded, the Newport News's mobility is noticeably easier to handle, though can still be unwieldy at times.

{{main|8 inch/55 Mark 16 (203 mm)}}

USS Newport News has [[8 inch/55 Mark 16 (203 mm)]] main guns. These are fundamentally the same gun barrels as those on the Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, but now boast a much higher rate of fire (10 rpm with max level crew vs 4 rpm of its predecessors), thanks to an automatic loading mechanism. This provides USS Newport News formidable firepower and makes her a serious threat to enemy cruisers and even some capital ships at close range, though don't get cocky because they can still blast you out of the water as easily as any other cruiser when they turn their guns on you.

Being the same armaments as the Baltimore-class, the guns also have similar shell choices:

* The stock common SAP shells have very poor penetration statistics and explosive filler for their calibre. Featuring even worse penetration than some {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} or even {{Annotation|5-inch|127 mm}} guns. The shell still have some niche use against destroyers and can certainly threaten other cruisers at close range. But they are completely useless against capital ships and anything smaller beyond 8 km range.

* The HE shell is reasonably effective, the 9.5 kg of filler capable of harassing deck mounts, setting fires and poking holes in enemy hulls, but it won't do well against ships with capable armouring and anti-fragmentation protection.

* The "super-heavy" APCBC shell features an average penetration and filler for {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} guns. It is noticeably heavier than an average {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} shell and has a slower muzzle velocity, intended to make it able to punch through relatively thin deck armour with its high ballistic trajectory, though this doesn't really work in practice. That being said, it's not a bad shell for using on major warships and the fast fire rate makes it fearsome in that regard.

The USS Newport News still carries the same amount of main battery ammunition as the Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, which have substantially lower rates of fire. Captains will need to allocate their ammo types carefully and keep an eye out on the ammo count during battle, or they might find themselves out of shells in the middle of a firefight.

Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)}}

USS Newport News has 6 dual-purpose, double-barrel 127 mm turrets, a common layout found on late-war US light and heavy cruisers. They have an excellent SP Common shell for use against lightly armoured destroyers, and a VT-fused HE shell for use against aircraft.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|3 inch Mk.33 (76 mm)}}

USS Newport News is in her 1962 state, after modifications to be a fleet flagship. The installation of flagship facilities required removal of most of her 3-inch AA guns, leaving only one dual mount on each side of the bridge. As a result, USS Newport News relies mostly on her secondary 5" guns for air defense. That said, these 3" guns, firing VT-fused HE shells by default, are powerful in their own right, and can be a last resort defense against aircraft and small boats.

'''Pros:'''

* Well-armoured and resistant against small-to-medium calibre fire
* Excellent crew distribution, At least 30% crew is allocated among citadel machineries
* Formidable firepower, The {{Annotation|8 inch|203 mm}}/55 Mark 16 guns can fire 10 rounds per minute
* Has air search and tracking radars
* Strong long-medium range AA with the numerous 127 mm secondaries
* Has two fire control rooms and 10 fire directors for both main battery group and auxiliary battery group

'''Cons:'''

* Very large and heavy, hampering the overall mobility and makes the ship easily spotted and targeted by any enemies
* Extremely fragile against battleships and battlecruisers. 305 mm and above calibre guns can overmatch the bulkhead and pierce the athwartship armour fairly easily
* The magazine of her second turret is above waterline
* Terrible stock SAP shell, forcing the ship to get close to the enemy to deal damage
* Limited light AA capability. Only two dual-mount 76 mm guns for AA; one for each side of the ship
* Relatively low ammo capacity. 1,350 rounds only support 15 mins of non-stop fighting with maximum crew
