== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} was the final [[Des Moines (Family)|Des Moines class]] to be completed. Laid down in November 1945 and commissioned in January 1949, she would go on to be the only ship of her class to continue in service past the early '60s. This would notably include serving as the flagship of the Atlantic fleet during the Cuban Missile Crisis, where she would also assist with counting the missiles once the crisis abated. She would go on to serve extensively during the Vietnam War and was eventually decommissioned in 1975.

'''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced during [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8021-event-winter-quest-en|2022 Winter Quest]] event. Compared to her sister ship [[USS Des Moines]], she's in her 1962 refit, which stripped out much of her anti-aircraft firepower. While this does mean that she isn't nearly as capable against aircraft with her two double {{Annotation|3-inch|76 mm}} autocannon mounts, she also has the same crew count, so she is much more capable of taking sustained fire from smaller vessels, as there's less crew exposed on deck for small calibre shells to knock out. With her quick fire rate of 6 seconds for the main battery, Newport News is capable of brawling with any ship smaller than a battlecruiser, and can even punch above her weight class provided the range is close enough.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
USS Newport News, as a member of the [[Des Moines (Family)|Des Moines class]], has a broadly similar armour layout to the [[Baltimore (Family)|Baltimore class]] developed earlier in the war. This includes extending the main armour belt to provide protection for the forward magazines, vastly improving the protection underneath the forward turrets from {{Annotation|0.75 inches|19.05 mm}} to {{Annotation|5.8 inches|147.32 mm}} of armour. The belt overall is slightly thinner as the [[Baltimore (Family)|Baltimore class]] has a {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} belt, but the extra coverage provided for the Newport News is a welcome addition. The fore and aft of the citadel are protected by {{Annotation|4.8 inches|121.92 mm}} of bulkhead armour, with thinner {{Annotation|0.75-inch|19.05 mm}} bulkheads interspersed throughout the citadel. The decks above the citadel are protected by {{Annotation|1-inch|25.4 mm}} of anti-fragmentation armour, the same found on earlier destroyers in the US tree. Lower in the ship is a {{Annotation|3.4-inch|86.36 mm}} deck armour plate to deal with  heavier incoming fire from longer ranges as well, this will protect against most cruiser calibre fire.

Her main battery turrets are well protected, with {{Annotation|8 inches|203.2 mm}} of armour on the turret face, angled at degrees to provide extra protection. This renders the turret face essentially impervious to any cruiser or destroyer fire, so long as it is facing within approximately 20 degrees of the enemy. This is not the case for the turret sides, with only {{Annotation|3.75 inches|95.25 mm}} of armour; this can be penetrated by all cruiser calibre and many destroyer calibre guns at close range. The roof is better protected to defeat plunging fire, with {{Annotation|4 inches|101.6 mm}} of armour. The barbettes have less armour, with {{Annotation|6.1 inches|154.94 mm}} of protection. These lead into the magazines, and the second turret magazine in particular. It is placed in an exposed position above the waterline unlike the Baltimores, so every precaution should be taken to avoid taking fire to this section.

Similar to other American cruisers, she lacks any form of torpedo bulges, instead relying on fuel tanks along the hull. These cover the entirety of the hull between the turrets, and can absorb some smaller torpedoes, though most will easily punch through. Captains should watch out for torpedo attacks at all times. If taking a hit is inevitable, try to manoeuvre the ship so that it takes the hit as close to the bow as possible, as the bow is mostly empty space and Newport News can survive a hit here with just some flooding. Any hits below the turrets, especially the second, should be avoided at all costs.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
With a flank speed of {{Annotation|33 kn|61 km/h, 38 mph}}, USS Newport News sits firmly in the middle of the pack for American cruisers; this speed allowed the [[Des Moines (Family)|Des Moines class]] to keep up with the existing cruisers, along with the carriers and Iowa-class battleships. This speed places her slightly ahead of the [[Brooklyn (Family)|Brooklyn class]], and captains shouldn't have any issues making it to capture zones and other key locations. This speed falls to {{Annotation|23 kn|43 km/h, 27 mph}} in a turn, which although leaving her as an easier target, is still faster than the Standard-type battleships' flank speeds.

The rudder takes around 2 seconds to induce movement to the ship, and while USS Newport News is relatively responsive, at 20,950 tons there is a lot of momentum behind her movements. Newport News is relatively manoeuvrable for a heavy cruiser, but captains should still be wary when traversing narrow passages as she is unable to make many of the turns that a destroyer or light cruiser could make.

{{main|8 inch/55 Mark 16 (203 mm)}}

USS Newport News has [[8 inch/55 Mark 16 (203 mm)]] main guns. These are fundamentally the same gun barrels as those on the Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, but now boast a much higher rate of fire (10 rpm with max level crew vs 4 rpm of its predecessors), thanks to an automatic loading mechanism. This provides USS Newport News formidable firepower and makes her a serious threat to enemy cruisers and even some capital ships at close range, though don't get cocky because they can still blast you out of the water as easily as any other cruiser when they turn their guns on you.

Being the same armaments as the Baltimore-class, the guns also have similar shell choices:

* The stock common SAP shells have very poor penetration statistics and explosive filler for their calibre. Featuring even worse penetration than some {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} or even {{Annotation|5-inch|127 mm}} guns. The shell still have some niche use against destroyers and can certainly threaten other cruisers at close range. But they are completely useless against capital ships and anything smaller beyond 8 km range.

* The HE shell is reasonably effective, the 9.5 kg of filler capable of harassing deck mounts, setting fires and poking holes in enemy hulls, but it won't do well against ships with capable armouring and anti-fragmentation protection.

* The "super-heavy" APCBC shell features an average penetration and filler for {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} guns. It is noticeably heavier than an average {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} shell and has a slower muzzle velocity, intended to make it able to punch through relatively thin deck armour with its high ballistic trajectory, though this doesn't really work in practice. That being said, it's not a bad shell for using on major warships and the fast fire rate makes it fearsome in that regard.

The USS Newport News still carries the same amount of main battery ammunition as the Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, which have substantially lower rates of fire. Captains will need to allocate their ammo types carefully and keep an eye out on the ammo count during battle, or they might find themselves out of shells in the middle of a firefight.

{{main|5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)}}

USS Newport News has 6 dual-purpose, double-barrel 127 mm turrets, a common layout found on late-war US light and heavy cruisers. They have an excellent SP Common shell for use against lightly armoured destroyers, and a VT-fused HE shell for use against aircraft.

{{main|3 inch Mk.33 (76 mm)}}

USS Newport News is in her 1962 state, after modifications to be a fleet flagship. The installation of flagship facilities required removal of most of her 3-inch AA guns, leaving only one dual mount on each side of the bridge. As a result, USS Newport News relies mostly on her secondary 5" guns for air defense. That said, these 3" guns, firing VT-fused HE shells by default, are powerful in their own right, and can be a last resort defense against aircraft and small boats.

'''Pros:'''

* Well-armoured and resistant against small-to-medium calibre fire
* Excellent crew distribution, At least 30% crew is allocated among citadel machineries
* Formidable firepower, The {{Annotation|8 inch|203 mm}}/55 Mark 16 guns can fire 10 rounds per minute
* Has air search and tracking radars
* Strong long-medium range AA with the numerous 127 mm secondaries
* Has two fire control rooms and 10 fire directors for both main battery group and auxiliary battery group

'''Cons:'''

* Very large and heavy, hampering the overall mobility and makes the ship easily spotted and targeted by any enemies
* Extremely fragile against battleships and battlecruisers. 305 mm and above calibre guns can overmatch the bulkhead and pierce the athwartship armour fairly easily
* The magazine of her second turret is above waterline
* Terrible stock SAP shell, forcing the ship to get close to the enemy to deal damage
* Limited light AA capability. Only two dual-mount 76 mm guns for AA; one for each side of the ship
* Relatively low ammo capacity. 1,350 rounds only support 15 mins of non-stop fighting with maximum crew
