== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
Laid down in 1928, '''{{Specs|name}}''' would be commissioned in 1930 as the lead ship of her class. Notably, these were originally classed as light cruisers due to their poor protection, but were reclassified after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty. Northampton was actually at sea near Pearl Harbour when the Japanese launched their surprise attack. She would later see battle in the Battle of the Santa Cruz islands, coming to the aid of Hornet before she sank, and would go on to be lost in the Battle of Tassafaronga. She would be struck by two torpedoes and began to take a list, but managed to stay afloat for 3 hours, long enough for an orderly evacuation.

It was introduced in [[Update "Raining Fire"]], and sits alongside the [[USS Portland]] as the lowest ranking heavy cruisers in the USN bluewater tree. Unlike the Portland however, she is in her 1941 refit, and therefore lacks the 20 mm anti-aircraft battery; this hampers her performance against aircraft. She has the same main battery of 9 x {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} guns, but has the same issue of weak armour in exchange. All light cruisers and even many destroyers will be able to penetrate the armour at battle ranges.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
USS Northampton's survivability is rather mediocre for an American heavy cruiser, and rather weak compared to the enemies it often faces in battle. Northampton has a main armour belt of just 3 inches (76 mm) of RHA, which can be easily penetrated by SAP and AP shells above 127 mm calibre. The magazines are protected by 95 mm of armour and sit below the waterline, meaning that they are relatively survivable. However, Northampton's ready-use shell rooms are directly below the turrets and thinly-protected, meaning that they can be detonated by enemy shells and cause severe damage. The turrets themselves only have 63mm in the front and even worse on the sides, meaning that even destroyers can penetrate and disable them. Finally, Northampton only has 872 crew members, which severely limits its effectiveness in battle.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Northampton has decidedly average mobility for a cruiser, with a top speed of 60 km/h in Realistic battles and 70 km/h in Arcade - this is on par with most cruisers of other navies. The ship's turning circle and acceleration are nothing special, either.

{{main|8 inch/55 Mark 9 (203 mm)}}

Northampton carries a main armament of nine 8"/55 Mk.9 guns in three triple mounts, two fore and one aft. These guns are the standard armament for American heavy cruisers, and pack an impressive punch. The guns have good ballistics, and can access four shell types: Mk.14 Common, Mk.19 APCBC, Mk.25 HC and Mk.17 SP Common. Of these shells, the Mk.17 Special Common shell is most effective against cruisers, as it has a great explosive mass and enough penetration for most cruiser main armour belts. The Mk.19 APCBC shell can be used against heavily-armoured targets, but has a relatively small explosive mass of 1.65 kg. Finally, the HC shell, with almost 10 kg of explosive filler, is highly effective against destroyers and unarmoured vessels.

However, the guns have two main drawbacks. Firstly, they have the slowest reload speed of any 8-inch gun, with a fire rate of just three rounds per minute (20-second gun reload). This means that they fire much slower than their contemporaries, which typically have a fire rate of five rounds per minute (12-second reload). As well, the guns have the slowest horizontal turret rotation speed of any heavy cruiser, at just 3.1 degrees/second (comparatively, the Admiral Hipper's guns rotate at 6.8 degrees/second).

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section.

{{main|5 inch/25 Mk.13 AA (127 mm)}}

USS Northampton carries a secondary battery of 8 x single mount {{Annotation|5-inch|127 mm}}/25 Mk.13 AA guns. Four of these are mounted abreast of the second funnel, two port and two starboard. The other four are mounted on a lower deck aft of the second funnel before the rear turret, once again two per side. The {{Annotation|5-inch|127 mm}}/25 is a purpose-built AA weapon, and therefore has no rounds intended for anti-ship duties, leaving captains with {{Annotation|HE-TF|High Explosive Time Fuse}} and {{Annotation|HE-VT|High Explosive Variable Time}} shells. The {{Annotation|HE-TF|High Explosive Time Fuse}} are heavily reliant on crew skills, so captains are recommended to upgrade the "Distance fuze set accuracy" crew skill to improve chances of a hit. The {{Annotation|HE-VT|High Explosive Variable Time}} is a much better overall shell, automatically exploding within 23 m of the target. This shell can also be used against lightly armoured ships and boats, as they will not explode midair before hitting the enemy ship. The shells will only be effective against destroyers and small watercraft, as any armoured vessel will simply shrug off the shells. They will destroy AA mounts and set fires to heavier ships but will do no appreciable damage to crew.

The guns of course have less range than the [[5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)]] developed later, but due to the shorter barrel it has a faster traverse rate allowing it to track enemy targets more efficiently, and with a 3 s reload the guns have a quick rate of fire as well. Captains should be mindful of the lower velocity of the rounds compared to the 38 calibre variant that may be more familiar. The gun mounts also have minimum shielding, so it is recommended to avoid repairing them until needed to avoid draining USS Northampton of vital crew.

{{main|1.1 inch/75 Mk.1 (28 mm)|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

Northampton carries four quadruple 1.1 inch "Chicago Pianos". The 1.1 inch/75 Mk.1 gun, otherwise known as the "Chicago Piano" (because it was the size of a baby grand-piano), was the standard anti-aircraft armament for most American ships prior to the introduction of the 40 mm Bofors cannon. These guns are mediocre at best; though they have a good fire rate (similar to the AN-M2 Browning), they aren't too effective at dealing damage, and also jam rather quickly. As well, take note that the gun doesn't have ammunition options.

Northampton also carries eight single 12.7 mm AN-M2 machine guns. The AN-M2 is a navalised anti-aircraft version of the popular Browning machine gun. This gun is rather ineffective at dealing significant damage to enemy aircraft, and is only effective within ~1.5-2 kilometres at most. As well, keep in mind that these guns have a long 12-second reload after the gun's magazine has been used.

=== Scout plane ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Plane}}

Located amidships are two catapults with one SOC-1 scout plane each which provide unique offensive and defensive abilities, expanding tactical options. Ship-launched scout planes fly just like regular tree units but lack munition choices and cockpit views. Alongside the typical abilities of strafing, dropping 2 x 100 lb bombs, and capturing zones, the SOC-1 and other scout planes have the added ability to lay down smoke cover (up to 3 times). Captains will be wise to remember to utilise the aircraft and consider when best to use it, for example to cap a point early or late in the match, to create a smoke screen to stymie enemy bombardment and repair, to attack enemy units directly, or perhaps something completely new! With two scout planes one can risk a cap attempt at the beginning of the match, saving the second for any opportunity that presents itself.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
USS Northampton isn't the easiest ship to play, especially given that it faces battleships often (which completely outclass it in every aspect except anti-aircraft protection) and many cruisers too (such as USS Brooklyn and USS Helena) which outclass it in terms of firepower. As such, the ship needs to be played carefully in order to succeed in battle.

Firstly, Northampton's main battery is quite mediocre. The nine 203 mm guns, placed in triple turrets (the same arrangement as the USS Portland), have an extremely weak reload speed of 17.1 seconds with a completely spaded crew, and 20+ seconds with a stock crew. This reload speed is not competitive against most other cruisers at the Northampton's BR, and severely limits the ship's damage potential. Furthermore, Northampton's guns are inaccurate - and that is, very inaccurate. These weapons have a lot of trouble hitting things reliably beyond ranges of 8 km, making the ship hard to play at longer ranges. These constraints mean that Northampton does a lot better at closer ranges, where its main battery can hit targets reliably.

Secondly, Northampton is not that survivable. Though it does have a relatively large crew size for a heavy cruiser, Northampton lacks heavy armour, especially on its citadel, which houses the massive engine block - this trait is shared by other American pre-war heavy cruisers including USS Pensacola and USS Portland. The ship also has little protection on its first stage shell rooms (38 mm of RHA), which can be detonated by stray shells. Because of these constraints, you should try to use ground cover as much as possible to preserve survivability. In maps such as South Kvarken, with plenty of island covers, stay behind islands wherever possible. In open maps such as the conquest maps, your only hope will be to stay behind the front lines, and hope that enemies don't target you.

Finally, note that Northampton does not have great anti-aircraft defence. As the next class of American heavy cruiser after the USS Pensacola, Northampton gets sixteen 28 mm "Chicago Piano" guns in four quadruple mounts as well as eight 12.7 mm AN-M2 Browning HMGs. These weapons lack range and power, limiting their effectiveness to ranges of less than 2.5 kilometres. Indeed, the ship does carry eight 127 mm Mk 25 guns, capable of firing AA-VT (proximity fuse) ammunition, but these weapons are not capable of firing fast enough to be able to destroy faster incoming aircraft. Because of this, you should try to stay with allied ships, particularly ships with great anti-aircraft protection. This will help ensure that your ship will stay safe from enemy aircraft.

The USS Northampton (CA-26) was the lead ship of the Northampton-class of heavy cruisers. Originally classified as a light cruiser due to her small size, she was later reclassified as a heavy cruiser because of her 8-inch armament. She served in the Pacific prior to the Second World War, and was escorting the USS Enterprise when the Japanese fleet attacked Pearl Harbour. She later served in the Guadalcanal campaign, participating in the Battle of Santa Cruz. However, she was sunk at the Battle of Tassafaronga, having been struck by Japanese torpedoes.<ref name=":0">Rickard, J. (2004)</ref><ref name=":1">US Navy Heritage Command. (2015)</ref>

=== Design and construction ===
The USS Northampton was the lead ship of the Northampton-class, the second American 'Treaty' heavy cruiser class following the [[USS Pensacola|Pensacola]]-class. Due to the limitations of the Washington naval treaty, they were very light at just 9,000 tons standard - even lighter than their predecessors, the [[USS Pensacola|Pensacolas]].<ref name=":0" /> The armament scheme was revised to feature nine 8-inch (203 mm) guns in three triple turrets, which would be featured on every subsequent American heavy cruiser.<ref name=":0" /> Their anti-aircraft armament was initially sparse but would be refitted later on. As with all American heavy cruiser designs, they did not carry any torpedo armament. The Northampton-class were capable of making 32.7 knots (60 km/h).<ref name=":0" />

The USS Northampton was laid down on April 12th of 1928, and launched on September 5th 1929. She was sponsored by Grace Coolidge, former first lady of the United states. After construction was completed, she was formally commissioned on May 17th 1930.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Northampton towing USS Hornet.jpg|thumb|380x380px|Northampton attempting to save the Crippled USS Hornet at the battle of Guadalcanal.]]

=== Service history ===
After her commissioning, the Northampton embarked on a shakedown cruise into the Mediterranean as part of the US Atlantic Fleet. Following the London Naval Treaty, the ship was reclassified as CA-26. In 1932, she moved to the Pacific fleet and was homeported at San Pedro; she would remain there until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=":1" />

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour, the Northampton was out at sea escorting the USS Enterprise with Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey on board. She subsequently escorted the aircraft carrier Hornet on the Doolittle raid and the carrier Enterprise during the Battle of Midway.<ref name=":1" /> She escorted the Hornet during the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, and attempted to keep her afloat after the carrier was severely damaged by Japanese aircraft. Her attempts were unsuccessful, and the Hornet was finished off by torpedoes and gunfire.<ref name=":1" />

The Northampton engaged in her final action, the Battle of Tassafaronga on November 30th 1942. A force of several American heavy cruisers and destroyers encountered a group of eight Japanese destroyers, tasked with delivering food to the forces at Guadalcanal.<ref name=":1" /> Taken by surprise, the Japanese force lost one of the destroyers with heavy damage to others. However, they retaliated with a torpedo attack and hit several of the American heavy cruisers. Northampton was hit by two Japanese [[Type 93 (610 mm) (Family)|Type 93 "Long Lance"]] torpedoes, which tore large gashes in her hull. Crippled and sinking, the ship was abandoned. Northampton received a total of six battle stars for her service during the Second World War.<ref name=":1" />
