== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
'''{{Specs|name}}''' was the 5th member of the [[Baltimore (Family)|Baltimore-class]] heavy cruisers, the first US heavy cruisers to be designed after the ending of the Washington and London naval treaties. Laid down in February 1943, Pittsburgh would be commissioned in October of 1944 and would serve through the rest of World War 2, mostly serving as part of the cover screen for Task Force 58. She would gain the nickname "Longest Ship in the War" after damage from Typhoon Viper caused her bow to snap off, leaving thousands of miles in between her bow and the rest of the ship as she returned to the States for repairs. She would be decommissioned in 1947, but recommissioned in 1951 with the commencement of hostilities in Korea. Though she saw no combat in this conflict, she would patrol the Atlantic and Mediterranean, finishing her last deployment in the Pacific before being decommissioned again in 1956. She would remain in the reserves until being sold for scrap in 1974.

Introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]], the USS Pittsburgh will be broadly similar to her classmate [[USS Baltimore]], though coming in a later 1953 refit. She has the same primary and secondary armament, but her anti-aircraft battery has been supplanted by {{Annotation|3-inch|76.2 mm}} autocannons firing {{Annotation|HE-VT|High-explosive variable timed}} shells, granting greater range at the cost of a slower fire rate. Pittsburgh also notably gains aircraft tracking radar, allowing her to serve well as an escort to larger, less protected ships such as dreadnought battleships.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
USS Pittsburgh, as a member of the [[Baltimore (Family)|Baltimore-class]] of heavy cruisers, was no longer subject to the terms of the Washington or London Naval Treaties, resulting in her having much thicker armour than her preceding classes. This is most evident in her main belt, which is up to a much more substantial {{Annotation|6 inches|152 mm}} compared to earlier heavy cruisers with a less than {{Annotation|3-inch|76.2 mm}} belt. This belt covers the midsection of the ship,  protecting the machinery spaces from harm. These also form bulkheads fore and aft of the machinery spaces and protect the steering gear in the stern of the ship as well. Directly above and to the sides of the main belt, the armour drops to {{Annotation|.75 inches|19.05 mm}} of anti-fragmentation armour, and the rest of the hull has {{Annotation|.5-inch|12.7 mm}} plates of anti-fragmentation armour as covering all compartments. These swathes of anti-fragmentation armour will not stop any armour piercing shells, but will greatly reduce damage from HE shells, especially those of destroyers and light cruisers. The main armoured deck of {{Annotation|2.5 inches|63.5 mm}} is positioned at the top of the {{Annotation|6-inch|152 mm}} armour belt, and above the steering gear and magazines, protecting from any plunging fire that may enter at odd angles.

The turrets are well armoured like other American ships, with a {{Annotation|8-inch|203.2 mm}} plate protecting the front of the turret, angled at 32° to increase effectiveness. This makes the turret effectively immune to most fire from destroyers and light cruisers, and at range against other heavy cruisers. Although it is incapable of stopping fire from enemy battlecruisers or battleships, it will still do well against other cruisers of the rank. This leads back into small {{Annotation|3.25-inch|82.55 mm}} plates, angled sharply at approximately 73° before reaching the sides and rear of the turrets. These are protected by meagre {{Annotation|1.5-inch|38.1 mm}} plates; these will protect against no more than 40 mm guns, and even destroyer shells will easily penetrate and knock the turret out of action. Captains should keep the turrets faced towards threats at all times, as the sides and rear of the turrets are very vulnerable areas. The turret barbettes are also protected against destroyer and light cruiser fire with {{Annotation|6.3 inches|160 mm}} of armour, leading down to the magazines. These are positioned well below the waterline and are unlikely to be hit, but have {{Annotation|3 inches|76 mm}} of armour surrounding them just in case.

Torpedo protection, as with other American cruisers, is provided only by fuel tanks. Captains should be wary of enemy torpedo spreads, as USS Pittsburgh is unlikely to be capable of taking hits from enemy torpedos without mortal damage to the ship.

{{main|8 inch/55 Mark 12 (203 mm)}}

Being a WW2 US cruiser, USS Pittsburgh shoots super-heavy {{Annotation|APCBC|Armour-piercing Capped Ballistic Capped}} shells out of her {{Annotation|8-inch|203 mm}} guns. These shells are heavier than contemporary shells from other nations, weighing over 150 kg, compared to the average of 110 kg. This gives them a longer flight time, but a steeper angle. The idea was that, at long ranges, the shells would penetrate battleship's decks from above instead of hitting the much thicker side armour. In spite of this, they still have more than enough penetration below 8 km to cleave through the belt, magazine, and barbette armour of even the most well-protected cruiser at its BR and above, allowing the Pittsburgh to quickly disarm and dispatch enemy cruisers with a few well-aimed salvos. This shell is prone to overpenetration and lacks much filler, so against most light cruisers it's recommended to fire the Mk.14 Common shell at close range; with 4.84 kg TNTe this will do much more reliable damage. For patrol vessels and destroyers, the Mk.25 HC shell with access to 9.5 kg explosive mass is recommended. When targeting a ship at close range is recommended to fire the turrets individually to hit specific components, as with a 15-second reload many cruisers will simply out-reload a traditional broadside.

<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|5 inch/38 Mk.12 (127 mm)}}

The secondary armament on the {{PAGENAME}} are six dual-purpose, dual-mounted 127 mm turrets, weapons that a majority of other Bluewater ships use and so players are quite familiar in their operation at this stage. These turrets are the {{PAGENAME}}'s first line of defence against PT boats and aircraft.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|3 inch Mk.33 (76 mm)}}

USS Pittsburgh carries ten 3 inch Mk.33 automatic cannons in twin installation. As part of her AAA, the gun fires HE-VT shells in her default configuration and has no other ammo options. The gun has a rate of fire of 50 rpm and overheats in 35 seconds. Unlike the 40 mm Bofors, the 3-inch gun mount has no shield or surrounding parapet to defend against shrapnel; the side mounts can only rotate 180° so they can't shoot over the superstructure and cover another broadside, whereas the Bofors can rotate 360°. Overall, Pittsburgh's AA barrage is quite sparse, and she is completely exposed to air raid after all AA guns are overheated.

AI gunners that man them can target larger opponents such as destroyers and cruisers, although the effect that this has on the Pittsburgh's damage output is minimal.
