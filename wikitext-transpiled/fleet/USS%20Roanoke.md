== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The ''Worcester''-class light cruisers are the final class of "gun cruiser" built for the United States Navy, being laid down just a few months before the end of World War II. The class was, in concept, built as a distinctive hybrid between the ''[[USS Cleveland|Cleveland]]''-class and ''[[USS Atlanta|Atlanta]]''/''Juneau''-class light cruiser, featuring twelve 6-inch guns mounted in six twin turrets arranged in linear configuration. Each 6-inch gun was intended to be dual-purpose, and as such they were housed inside a turret with high elevation and firing angles to engage air targets, not dissimilar with the 5-inch dual-purpose guns onboard the ''Cleveland'' and ''Atlanta''. However, with the advent of guided anti-ship and surface-to-air missile, the ''Worcester''-class, along with its heavier counterpart the ''[[Des Moines (Family)|Des Moines]]''-class, were considered obsolete. Out of ten original ships ordered, only two ships; ''Worcester'' and ''Roanoke'' were completed. Neither saw any action during their relatively short 11-year career before being decommissioned in 1958.

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' features an alternative take on the "gun cruiser" design of the ''[[USS Cleveland|Cleveland]]'' and ''[[USS Brooklyn|Brooklyn]]'', featuring twelve 6-inch guns that were capable of engaging surface and air targets. As the ship is optimized for anti-air duties using her 6-inch guns, she lacked the 5-inch dual-purpose guns that were a common feature of American cruisers, thus captains may often find her dedicated air defense to be somewhat lacklustre. Nevertheless, once the HE-VT shell options are unlocked, the ''Roanoke'' is capable of easily eliminating both ground and air targets, even at longer ranges.

<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

While having good firepower, the survivability of the {{PAGENAME}} is rather poor, mostly owing to its ammo placement. Not only is its magazine huge, but the number 1, 3, and 4 turrets have ammo placed right at the waterline, in contrast to most other ships that have their ammo stored at the bottom of the hull. The 127mm armour belt won't stop any AP shells at this BR or higher, so even a single salvo from an enemy cruiser is very likely to cause instant destruction from an ammo detonation. Therefore, the {{PAGENAME}} should avoid the most heated confrontations, instead helping allies take out isolated enemies, aircraft or small, nimble boats and destroyers, a job it does well thanks to its radar and fast rangefinder. If forced into combat against enemies of equal or greater rank, the {{PAGENAME}} should try to have hard cover or allies nearby to hide behind. Even shallow cover like low-lying islands can be helpful; as long as the vulnerable magazines near the waterline are hidden, the {{PAGENAME}} will become just as durable as other cruisers at this BR.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* Twelve fast-firing 6-inch guns in six turrets, thus being able to keep more firepower in case some were disabled
* Main guns has very good handling and elevation, capable of engaging surface and air targets
* Very well protected for a light cruiser, with layer of anti-frag armour and thick citadel armour along the length of the ship
* Numerous 3-inch AA guns are effective at harrassing deck mounts and countering PT boats
* Generally fast and manoeuvrable despite the size
* Has an air search radar and fast rangefinding system
'''Cons:'''
* Very large in size, can be easily spotted and targeted
* Six turrets in linear configuration resulting in a huge ammo rack size, any shot that went through citadel are likely to detonate it
* Much like other American cruiser, it has no torpedo armaments
* Lack of 5-inch dual-purposes guns resulting into mediocre anti-air capability while stock, forcing the usage of 6-inch guns to manually engage air targets
