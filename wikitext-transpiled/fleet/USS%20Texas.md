The USS Texas was a New York-class battleship. Built as the first ship of her class, even before the lead ship USS New York, she was built by Newport News Shipbuilding shipyard and laid down on 17th April 1911 and commissioned on 12th March 1914. USS Texas was the first in many things for the US Navy, including the first to carry 14-inch (356 mm) guns, the first to mount anti-aircraft guns, the first to be able to launch aircraft, the first to control gunfire with directors and range keepers, and one of the first to receive a production radar. She is also the last surviving dreadnought-style battleship, conserved as a museum ship in dry-dock in Galveston, Texas.

Her armament consisted of five turrets each armed with a pair of 14-inch/45 Mark 12 cannons, with two turrets on the bow, one amidships and the last two astern. Secondary armament was made up of six 5 inch Mark 7 (127 mm) cannons in casemates with 3 on each side of hull. Short range anti-aircraft battery is supplied with a total of forty-four Oerlikon Mk. II 20 mm autocannons in various positions all over the ship, while medium-range defence is made up of ten quadruple Bofors L/60 Mark 2 cannons. Long-range anti-air protection is made up of ten 3-inch/50 Mk.10 (76 mm) cannons. USS Texas served in WWI in Europe without seeing any action. In 1926 she underwent a refit that added torpedo blisters to the side of hull, making it wider. At the beginning of WWII, she patrolled the Atlantic until returning to United States in 1941. In 1942, she would return to the Atlantic and then the Mediterranean as part of task force supporting Operation Torch. During the North African landings, she conducted two fire support missions bombarding Vichy French positions. Until D-Day in 1944, she resumed escorting convoys. She supported the Omaha beach landing and Rangers attacking Pointe du Hoc. After the capture of France, she left to the Pacific to take part in the Battle of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. She was placed in reserve on 18th June 1946. She became a museum ship in 1948.

'''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as the third 14-inch US Navy battleship. Unlike [[USS Arizona|Arizona]], she possesses less firepower due to having only ten guns instead of twelve found on Arizona. As a WWI-era coal-powered dreadnought, USS Texas is quite slow and sluggish. Her magazines, although at the waterline, are protected by 305 mm thick belt armour which is sufficient protection against most long-range shells coming in at an angle. As USS Texas is in her 1945 refit, she has an anti-air search radar at her disposal, giving information about incoming threats from afar and with her large battery of medium and light autocannons ready to deal with any threat.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Being the last of the US Navy dreadnoughts before [[USS Nevada]] introduced the "all-or-nothing" armour scheme, USS Texas uses the older distributed armour scheme. Compared to the other US battleships at her rank, this means she has both a thinner and narrower main belt than both the [[USS Nevada]] and [[USS Arizona]], with a {{Annotation|12-inch|304.8 mm}} belt. This is still greater than the earlier Delaware and [[Wyoming (Family)|Wyoming-class]] battleships, but the belt doesn't cover nearly as extensive an area. It quickly falls off to {{Annotation|9 inches|228.6 mm}} of armour covering the majority of the hull, ending slightly below the secondary battery with {{Annotation|6.5 inches|165.1 mm}} of armour plating. While this is beneficial when fighting light cruisers and below, this does allow strong heavy cruisers and battleships to still quite easily punch through the belt at typical ranges; the armour only serving to trigger the fuse on armour-piercing shells. Overall, this armour scheme is better for fighting cruisers, but compared to contemporary rank battleships like the [[USS Nevada|Nevada]] it will be worse off in a battleship duel.

As is standard for US battleships, the main-battery turrets are still well armoured, though not to the extreme extent of the later battleships. A {{Annotation|14-inch|355.6 mm}} plate, angled at 26 degrees serves as the main protection, and should protect from all but the most powerful battleship guns at point blank range; more than adequate enough for 99 percent of engagements. The sides and rear of the turrets however fall down to {{Annotation|8 inches|203.2 mm}}, capable of being penetrated by nearly every cruiser. Captains should remember to keep their turrets oriented towards the majority of threats, as being shot from these angles will easily disable them. The top is well protected from plunging fire with a {{Annotation|5.75-inch|146.05 mm}} plate, and the barbettes are reasonably armoured with {{Annotation|12 inches|304.8 mm}} of armour covering the majority, although there are some sections fore and aft with only {{Annotation|10 inches|254 mm}}. The deck has a complicated, multilayer layout. The upper layer ranges from {{Annotation|1.75 inches|44.45 mm}} to {{Annotation|2.75 inches|69.85 mm}} in thickness, and serves to trigger the fuse on plunging shells or AP bombs. The second layer then ranges from {{Annotation|1-inch|25.4 mm}} to {{Annotation|1.5 inches|38.1 mm}} of armour, and should stop any explosive damage or splinters from reaching the magazines or the engine room. The magazines are positioned mostly below the waterline, but as with other American battleships, a small amount does protrude over the waterline; captains should attempt to make this difficult to hit.

Finally, the USS Texas is in her 1945 refit, and therefore has access to torpedo bulges. These will absorb up to 250 kg warheads, the same as other US battleships. This should protect from most torpedo drops, although a few select torpedoes like those found on the [[PT-810]] or, of course, anything with the [[Type 93 (610 mm) (Family)|Long Lance]] will blow past this protection, and usually only one or two of these are lethal. Captains should not rely on this torpedo protection, and instead should attempt to avoid torpedoes as much as possible; if a torpedo hit is inevitable, avoid a hit near the magazines if at all possible.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
USS Texas as designed was intended to hit {{Annotation|21.0 kn|39 km/h;24.2 mph}} at flank speed, similar to that of other US Navy battleships at the time. Over time, this would fall incredibly slightly to {{Annotation|20.5 kn|38 km/h;23 mph}} with the extra weight of the torpedo bulges, armour and anti-aircraft guns. This places her squarely between the [[USS Arizona]] which is still in its prewar refit and [[USS Nevada]], the current slowest US battleship. It takes Texas approximately 40 seconds to attain this speed and 50 seconds to come to a halt. Just like with other battleships, Texas has a wide turning circle, and whilst doing so her speed falls to only {{Annotation|14.0 kn|26 km/h;16 mph}}. It also takes her quite some time to respond to the helm, approximately 4-5 seconds passing before she actually begins the turn. Captains should be wary of this tendency when attempting to traverse congested waters, as it is exceedingly easy to run aground when attempting to do so. Another quirk of the Texas is that similar to the [[USS Arizona|Arizona]], her bow does like to swing back around in the opposite direction after turning, so some slight rudder usage might be necessary to keep the bow in the intended direction.

{{main|14 inch/45 Mk.12 (356 mm)}}

The commissioning of the New York class introduced the 14" (356 mm) gun as the most powerful naval cannon in the world until the British commissioned the first of the Queen Elizabeth class ships later that year, and was still quite formidable even by the end of WW2. Mounted in five double turrets, there is a measure of resiliency by less loss of firepower from a disabled turret.

Only armour-piercing and high-explosive shells are available for the ship. The HE shells are decidedly mediocre for the calibre in terms of explosive filler, but the AP shells have a very respectable level of penetration for a high tier ship, especially as the range increases.

If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In ship-to-ship combat, the Texas will be similar to the [[USS Nevada]] and [[USS Arizona]], which struggle against the latest battlecruisers and battleships; all three are at least 20 years older and the technology differences shows. What Texas will excel at is AAA cover, with its excellent AAA quantity and quality, assisted by radar to spot incoming threats. Try to stay near friendly ships to protect them against aerial threats and any small torpedo boats trying to sneak in.

The USS Texas is truly "The First and the Last". Although ordered after the USS New York (BB-34), construction started, was finished, and commissioned into the US Navy two months ahead. At commissioning she was the first capital ship in world to mount 14" cannons and the first US Navy "super dreadnought". This was just a start!
USS Texas lists of '''Firsts''' ''in the US Navy'':

* Anti-Air gun installation, 3" on top of the ship cranes; August 1916
* Test "kite balloon" in mid 1918
* Test feasibility of carrying exposed aircraft across ocean 20 October - 4 November 1918 (platforms installed by British Royal Navy at Jarrow Slake, England).
* First to launch aircraft; 11 March 1919
* First to mount radar; Late 1938
* First US warship to be decommissioned and become a permanent museum

Finally

* '''''The Last''''' Dreadnought style battleship left afloat in the world.

USS Texas served in the US Navy an extraordinarily long time even before becoming a museum, was a witness to monumental changes in human history. Some key dates compared to events in Texas history to illustrate world events.
