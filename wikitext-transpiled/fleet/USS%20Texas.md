== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American battleship {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]]. When she was commissioned on 12 March 1914, she was the most powerful battleship in the world. Today, the USS Texas is the sole remaining intact example of a "Dreadnought" class warship in the world, built during the great battleship age over 100 years ago. In-game, the Texas in its 1945 configuration is filled to the brim with 20 mm and 40 mm anti-air guns, making this perhaps the top defensive ship in-game. As an added bonus, this includes a radar to spot enemy air well before it is a threat.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
Being an early dreadnought-era battleship, the armour is very spread out, similar to the previous [[USS North Dakota|North Dakota]] and [[USS Wyoming|Wyoming]] classes. In fact, this layout was radically changed in the very next class, the [[USS Nevada]] with all the armour focused on the core citadel. Even though the 1925 refit doubled the deck armour, newer AP rounds will penetrate deep into the ship. The flip side is the multiple layers of armour will defend much better against HE or SAP/APHE rounds. The large added torpedo blister will easily absorb torpedo damage, if a torpedo boat or aircraft happens to get through your AAA screen!

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
Big and slow like other battleships, one can make a fresh pot of US Navy coffee in the time to turn 180 degrees! Plan which way to turn when entering battle and don't try to turn around. Small turns to help guns line up to target is advisable, especially the 5" guns as they have limited arcs.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|14 inch/45 Mk.12 (356 mm)}}

The New York class introduced the 14" (356 mm) gun into the world, being the most powerful ship cannon at time, and was still formidable even by the end of WW2. Only an AP and HE round are available, good enough for the mission at hand. Mounted in five double turrets, there is a measure of resiliency by less loss of firepower from a disabled turret.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In ship-to-ship combat, the Texas will be similar to the [[USS Nevada]] and [[USS Arizona]], which struggle against the latest battlecruisers and battleships; all three are at least 20 years older and the technology differences shows. What Texas will excel at is AAA cover, with its excellent AAA quantity and quality, assisted by radar to spot incoming threats. Try to stay near friendly ships to protect them against aerial threats and any small torpedo boats trying to sneak in.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 10 x 14" (356 mm) main guns
* 5 individual turrets
* Massive number of AA guns
* Aerial search and tracking radars
* Resistant to HE shells

'''Cons:'''

* Armour weak against AP shells
* Sluggish manoeuvring
* 14" rounds weaker compared to other newer types

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The USS Texas is truly "The First and the Last". Although ordered after the USS New York (BB-34), construction started, was finished, and commissioned into the US Navy two months ahead. At commissioning she was the first capital ship in world to mount 14" cannons and the first US Navy "super dreadnought". This was just a start!
USS Texas lists of '''Firsts''' ''in the US Navy'':
* Anti-Air gun installation, 3" on top of the ship cranes; August 1916
* Test "kite balloon" in mid 1918
* Test feasibility of carrying exposed aircraft across ocean 20 October - 4 November 1918 (platforms installed by British Royal Navy at Jarrow Slake, England).
* First to launch aircraft; 11 March 1919
* First to mount radar; Late 1938
* First US warship to be decommissioned and become a permanent museum
Finally
* '''''The Last''''' Dreadnought style battleship left afloat in the world. 

USS Texas served in the US Navy an extraordinarily long time even before becoming a museum, was a witness to monumental changes in human history. Some key dates compared to events in Texas history to illustrate world events. 

'''17 April 1911:''' construction of what will be ''USS Texas (''BB-35), began.
