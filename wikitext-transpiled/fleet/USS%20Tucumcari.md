== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

The Patrol Gunboat Hydrofoil Tucumcari (PGH-2) was built for operation by the Navy at a cost of $4 million by Boeing with subcontractor. She was unique at the time by using water-jet propulsion instead of a propeller in water, the water intake being at the base of the rear foils, pushed though a jet turbine engine powered pump, and exiting under the hull. When in shallow water or coming to port, the three hydrofoils would fold up and a small engine powered propeller with be used for manoeuvring. She was the basis for the [[Sparviero]]-class and [[PG 02]] hydrofoil patrol boats.

Armament is typical of PT boats, being common 40 mm Bofors and Browning machine guns.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

The PGH-2 lacks armour, and the ammunition for the 40 mm Bofors gun is exposed, not to mention that they aren't armoured, so they can be hit easily.

The gunners are all exposed, so be careful not to let them get hit. She is also a small boat and small crew, and at full speed is well above the water, making for a larger target.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
PGH-2 is a hydrofoil, naturally she is quite fast, but far from the fastest in game. She has a good turn radius, but in doing so loses speed very fast. Fortunately, acceleration is excellent and stopping is acceptable, though doing S turns will rapidly slow you down. The biggest downside is shallow water obstacles, at slow speed she will frequently hit land, or sunken ships.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells.

{{main|Bofors L/60 Mark 3 (40 mm)}}

The 40 mm Bofors is your main armament, and a powerful one at that. The single Bofors cannons is in the bow with approximately 300 degrees of arc on horizontal plane. The cannons become almost ineffective at ranges above 2 km (1.25 mi). Continuous firing will diminish the precision of rounds, and could cause the cannon to overheat, needing a long cooldown.

{{main|AN-M2 (12.7 mm)}}

The AN-M2 machine guns can fire until they run out of ammo, overall these are mostly used against smaller boats and planes, mostly ineffective at ranges above 1 km (0.62 mi).

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Tucumcari is the fastest boat in the USN, so she is good for one thing, capping distant points. While powerful, the 40 mm Bofors is not enough to take down destroyers, but be a bigger target for them. She will need to take special tactics to do well, but can be a match winning units, so keep handy. Your biggest threat is other rapid fire boats, less from slow firing ships over 4,000 m.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good top speed overall, best in USN
* Has a powerful 40 mm gun
* Good manoeuvrability

'''Cons:'''

* Overall armament is rather light compared to others with lower BR
* As with any hydrofoil, when at top speed the hull rises, making her a bigger target
* Very light anti-aircraft armament for BR, allowing planes to get really close to her before dropping their ordnance

== History ==

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

The USS Tucumcari, named after the city in New Mexico, was a hydrofoil boat developed by the Boeing company in the late 1960s to test a decade's worth of hydrofoil research and development. She was a true state-of-the-art ship, sporting the latest in hydrofoil technology, electronics and a powerful gas turbine engine. All of this granted the ship an excellent top speed and manoeuvrability, whilst also allowing it to seamlessly traverse even rough waters. USS Tucumcari was delivered and commissioned to the U.S. Navy in March 1968.

In her early service life, Tucumcari was thoroughly tested in the Pacific waters off the American west coast, performing various patrol missions and taking part in fleet exercises. Following this, the ship was sent on its first combat missions to Vietnam, taking part in Operation Market Time. There, Tucumcari managed to successfully prove her effectiveness in combat conditions with positive remarks on her performance.

After her return to the United States in 1970, she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet before being sent off on a European demonstration tour in 1971. Throughout the tour, USS Tucumcari visited several European (NATO) countries including Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Greece and Turkey, in an effort to demonstrate the capability of hydrofoil propulsion to other NATO members.

USS Tucumcari returned to the States once more in October 1971 and resumed with, among others, coastal patrol duties with the U.S. Coast Guard. In November 1972 however, the ship was severely damaged after running aground on a coral reef at full speed during a simulated combat mission off the coast of Puerto Rico. Due to the excessive damage, it was deemed uneconomical to recover and repair the ship. Thus, USS Tucumcari was struck off the Naval Register in November 1973 and was subsequently taken apart for scraps.

The USN's success with the Tucumcari was noticed by the Italians, and used the hydrofoil layout of the former as the bases for their new [[Sparviero]]-class patrol boat. Although they look similar at a glance, it is mainly limited to just the hydrofoils and water jet propulsion, the rest of the hull was a unique design. The Japanese in turn were interested and purchased 3 of the Sparviero's but changed the armaments, in game as the [[PG 02]].
