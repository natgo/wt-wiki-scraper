== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''VLT-2''' was a French torpedo boat of the VLT series, developed from the Type 40K design by Charles Picker's Lorraine Dietrich company. Originating from a 1937 French torpedo boat programme, the Type 40K was initially intended for export but ended up being partially built in France and the UK. During World War II, some of these boats were seized by Germany and repurposed. Post-war, as France was liberated, the Meulan shipyards continued construction of several boats based on the Type 40K, including the VLT-2. Completed in the late 1940s, the VLT-2 was initially equipped with 1,100 hp VK-105 engines from Yak aircraft, but these were later replaced by German Jumo 211 engines. Despite showing impressive performance during trials, the VLT-2 and its sister vessel were deemed obsolete. The VLT-2 was decommissioned and dismantled in 1951, while the VLT-1 served as a model for export to the Israeli Navy before being dismantled in 1958.

Introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]], '''{{Specs|name}}''' is notable for being the first motor torpedo boat in the game to feature swivel-mounted torpedo tubes. This capability, combined with her exceptional mobility, enables her to execute surprise attacks against large vessels. However, with only two torpedoes on board, she is unable to create effective torpedo walls, making it necessary to use islands and other hard cover to approach enemy vessels as closely as possible. Her gunnery armament is respectable, yet, like other wooden motor torpedo boats, she may struggle in direct confrontations with dedicated gunboats. The vessel's guns are divided into Primary and Secondary groups, allowing her to utilise AI gunners to engage enemy aircraft. This can be particularly advantageous when switching to the secondary armament group as the enemy plane approaches.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

During the occupation of France in the 1940s, French shipyards still had a number of vessels in construction. Part of these were a set of ten boats, which the Germans began converting into mine clearing vessels and rescue boats for the Luftwaffe. Shortly after the liberation, most of these projects were canceled. However, two of the vessels were converted into torpedo boats, being designated VLT-1 and VLT-2. These vessels underwent extensive evaluation in the postwar period, but the Navy ended up not pursuing building more units. In the end, VLT-2 ended up being dismantled in 1949 while the VLT-1 served as a basis for a new series of MTBs.
