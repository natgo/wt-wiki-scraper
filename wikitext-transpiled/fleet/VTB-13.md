== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Dance of Dragons"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* Fast and agile
* 20 mm Oerlikon at the lowest BR
* Excellent choice of ammunition, great ballistics, and enough rounds in a single magazine to destroy any target at this BR
* Ability to switch to a 7.7 mm secondary weapon, allowing AI gunners to engage aerial targets with the Oerlikon at over 2 km range
* Small silhouette
* Tiny steering gear is very unlikely to suffer critical damage

'''Cons:'''
* Forward firing arcs are covered only by the 7.7 mm secondary, which is inadequate against the majority of targets
* When angling the boat to use the Oerlikon, the entire length of the boat is exposed, making it an easy kill
* The lack of torpedoes can be detrimental against large targets at higher BRs
