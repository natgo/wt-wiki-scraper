== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French motor torpedo boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Dance of Dragons"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
As with all reserve torpedo boats, there is no real armour to speak of. VTB-8's 40mm thick wooden hull and 15mm thick wooden superstructure is typical of early torpedo boats and is shared with the MAS-561, PT-6, and Type T-14. The radio station and pilothouse are relatively small and set roughly amidships, which reduces the size of the target the enemy needs to hit to damage the craft's steering. The single gun mount is very small and therefore hard to disable, which will allow you to keep firing in desperate situations. If it is somehow destroyed, it won't affect your overall crew count. In total, the boat can hold ten crew members, with three in each hull section and one in the pilothouse, needing a minimum of three crew to operate.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The boat is surprisingly agile, but it's primary asset is its speed. Being faster than any reserve boat other than the Russian G-5, you can beat the competition to the capture point, escape from big ships, and close the distance with the enemy as needed.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|1909R (450 mm)}}
Being a pre-WW1 torpedo, the M1909R has the shortest range of any torpedo carried on a reserve coastal vessel (2 km), along with an average speed (61 km/h) and payload (144 kg). Suffice to say, the user will need to get as close as possible to the enemy before launching, provided 50 meters of distance is left between launcher and target for the torpedo to arm. Released by a unique animated Loire "claw" deployment system off either side of the boat, captains must take care to angle the hull so that the launchers are pointing directly at the target's path. This is unlike the VTB-14 which drops the torpedoes off the stern, requiring less angling of the hull, but increasing their travel time. It is best to use the M1909R in close-range ambushes from behind cover. Targets should mostly consist of other coastal vessels and destroyers due to the torpedo's small payload which can be entirely absorbed by battleship torpedo protection systems rated to withstand 250 kg of TNT.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The boat is very fast for a reserve vessel, beating out all but the sleek duralumin G-5 for top speed. This can be used to your advantage when attacking capture points or for closing the distance with your enemy - something you will need to do regularly to achieve any sort of lethality from your small calibre weapons. The tripod gun mount provides an excellent 360 degree firing arc as well as between -10 and 80 degrees of elevation for use against aircraft. Keeping this in mind, it's best to attack all targets "bow-in" to expose as little of your hull as possible. Given the wooden construction, it's not the best boat for "bow-tanking" but that is by far your best hope for survival against aware enemies. As with all belt-fed weapons, managing your reloads is key. However, with a weapon of this low calibre, you need as many bullets as possible to be ready before you hit that several second reload downtime. If you believe an engagement is coming up or lack visibility on the threats ahead, make sure to empty your magazine and get a fresh one.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast and agile
* Stable gunnery platform at high speeds
* 360° arc of fire for both guns, with very good vertical guidance
* Good survivability for the BR
* Small silhouette
* Tiny steering gear is very unlikely to suffer critical damage

'''Cons:'''

* Poor firepower
* Limited selection of ammunition
* Very short range of the torpedoes, making them extremely situational
