== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet motor gun boat {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as a reward during [[wt:en/news/5852-special-news-war-thunder-s-birthday-discounts-and-gifts-en|War Thunder's 6th anniversary]], [[wt:en/news/6442-special-war-thunder-reaches-its-7th-year-en|War Thunder's 7th anniversary]], and [[wt:en/news/7945-special-happy-anniversary-war-thunder-en|War Thunder's 10th Anniversary]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Ya-5M has no armour protection. Its hull is made out of 4 mm steel and its superstructure is made out of 15 mm thick wood. The crew consists of 10 people, therefore it is very vulnerable. The ship is quite prone to ammo rack detonation because its rocket launcher sits on the deck and the second ammo rack is pretty big and located above the waterline. The ship's third ammo rack is located below waterline and is therefore protected by water. The engine compartment is big and takes shots easily. The engine is located between the fuel tanks in the middle of the ship. 

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Ya-5M is quite slow to accelerate. It reaches 44 km/h forwards and -18 km/h backwards (33 km/h and -13 km/h in RB). The Ya-5M does not have a very good speed, but it performs well in a turn.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|DShK (12.7 mm)}}

The primary armament of the Ya-5M consists of two 12.7 mm DSHK machine guns (the first turret mounted above the wheelhouse and the second in an aft pintle). These guns are known for their fast fire rate and decent armour penetration at their rank, on the Ya-5M however, one must turn the ship slightly broadside to enable the usage of both guns at once, this can present a problem while aiming the rockets.

APIT belts are suggested as they contain both HE and AP mixed to maximize damage output against all possible targets.

=== Special armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Special}}
<!-- ''Mortars, rocket launchers and missiles are also effective in skilled hands and can take an off-guard opponent by surprise. Evaluate the ammunition of this type of armament and rate its performance in combat. If there are no special armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|M-8}}

The Ya-5M comes armed with 24 M-8 rockets and one full reload. These rockets are decent area-denial light artillery weapons, but suffer from terrible accuracy beyond 100 m due to conditions at sea. It is recommended to fire these rockets in 4-5 burst salvoes to offset the lack of precision.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide â€“ don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ya-5M is a lightly-armoured patrol boat useful for close combat. Its 2 x 12.7 mm DShK machine guns are the primary anti-air and naval engagement weapon. The rockets can decimate enemy patrol boats, but their inaccuracy is a downside, especially in choppy waters. The rockets are very ineffective against enemy destroyers, as their armour prevents any real damage. You may only damage exposed compartments, auxiliary weaponry and lightly-armoured gun turrets. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Good armaments
* Decent stability and low roll

'''Cons:'''

* Quite slow
* Low accuracy and damage from rockets
* Small crew
* Exposed gun positions

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
