== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] as part of the release of the fleet open beta test.

The Z12 Erich Giese was a German Type 1934A destroyer, built as the eighth of twelve ships of this type for the German Navy in the 1930s. The ship was laid down on 3 May 1935 and she was launched on 12 March 1937.

The ship is extremely agile for a ship of this size. Her main armament consists of five 12.8 cm/45 SK C/34 cannons, while the secondary armament consists of two 3.7 cm SK C/30 cannons. For air defence, the Z12 Erich Giese has six 2 cm/65 C/38 machine guns. For heavier targets, the Z12 Erich Giese also has two torpedo launchers, each equipped with 4 x 53.3 cm G7a torpedoes.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.''

{{main|12.8 cm/45 SK C/34 (128 mm)}}

{{:12.8 cm/45 SK C/34 (128 mm)/Ammunition|12.8 cm Sprgr. L/4.4 Kpf.Z, 12.8 cm Sprgr. L/4.4 Bd.Z, 12.8 cm Sprgr. L/4.4 Zt.Z}}

The main armament of the Z 12 Erich Giese consists in five 128 mm naval cannons, two of them are located at the front of the ship, one is located in the middle of the ship and the remaining two are located at the back.

These cannons are able to shoot three types of ammunition. First, the Sprgr. Kpf.Z HE shell with 2 kg of TNT equivalent and a muzzle velocity of 830 m/s. This is the standard ammunition for the Z12 Erich Giese. The next one is the Sprgr. Bd.z, a base-fused HE shell with more penetration in but with less explosive mass, only 1.4 kg of TNT equivalent and the same muzzle velocity of 830 m/s. The last shell is the Sprgr. Zt.Z and it comes with the same amount of TNT and muzzle velocity as the Sprgr. Bd.Z but it is equiped with a time fuze, which can be useful when engaging enemy aircraft, and can compensate the lack of air defense of the Z12 Erich Giese

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
{{main|SK C/30 (37 mm)}}

''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.''

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
{{main|2 cm/65 C/38 (20 mm)}}

''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.''

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
{{main|G7a (533 mm)|WBG depth charge}}
<!--''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.''-->

The Z12 Erich Giese is equipped with two quadruple torped launchers, which are located in the middle of the ship. The G7a is a deadly torpedo and can hullbreak any destroyer and can severly damage cruisers and battleships. The Z12 Erich Giese has also the option to use 4 WBG Depth Charges. 

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!--''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".''-->

'''Pros:'''

* High mobility and agility
* Powerful torpedos

'''Cons:'''

* Lack of air-defense
* Lack of armour

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the ship in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the ship and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Ship-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the ship's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
