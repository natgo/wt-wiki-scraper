== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]] as part of the fleet closed beta test.

The Z22 Anton Schmitt is one of the 6 Type 1936 destroyers built for the German Kriegsmarine between 1936 and 1938. Out of the six ships in the class, only the Z20 Karl Galster survived until the end of the war, all remaining units were lost during the Invasion of Norway in 1940.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Z22 Anton Schmitt does not possess any armour except its 16 mm thick steel hull protecting it from small calibre machine gun fire. The main gun mounts are protected from the front, top, and sides by 8 mm thick anti-fragmentation armour shields protecting them from shrapnel. The beam main gun ammunition storage is relatively safe as it's located on the waterline, while the secondary ammunition storage is well above the waterline, leaving it vulnerable to detonation. The stern main gun ammunition storage can be found above the waterline, directly under turret No.3 and in between No.3 and No.4, sharing a similar issue of vulnerable magazines with ships such as the T22.

All the Z22's machinery is located above the waterline, which exposes it to damage by autocannons and high-calibre machine guns.

The crew complement is large, consisting of 323 sailors.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->
The Z22 is quite an agile ship, but it suffers from poor acceleration past 40 km/h and takes a while to reach max speed.

<!-- ''Provide information about the characteristics of the primary armament. Evaluate their efficacy in battle based on their reload speed, ballistics and the capacity of their shells. Add a link to the main article about the weapon: <code><nowiki>{{main|Weapon name (calibre)}}</nowiki></code>. Broadly describe the ammunition available for the primary armament, and provide recommendations on how to use it and which ammunition to choose.'' -->
{{main|SK C/34 (127 mm)}}

The Z22 Anton Schmitt is armed with a five 12.7 cm SK C/34 cannons in single mounts, with two located at beam, and three at stern. All the turrets have ready-use ammo consisting of 10 rounds with a rate of fire of 18 rounds per minute, decreasing to 15 rounds per minute after depleting the ready-use ammo. Three different rounds are available, HE, HE with base fuse and HE-TF against aerial threat. It is advised to use the HE shell with base fuse to cause some serious damage to your opponents by aiming at their weak spots such as magazines above waterline or turrets. The HE-TF shell can be used against incoming aircraft at long ranges as the guns have good elevation.

=== Secondary armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Secondary}}
<!-- ''Some ships are fitted with weapons of various calibres. Secondary armaments are defined as weapons chosen with the control <code>Select secondary weapon</code>. Evaluate the secondary armaments and give advice on how to use them. Describe the ammunition available for the secondary armament. Provide recommendations on how to use them and which ammunition to choose. Remember that any anti-air armament, even heavy calibre weapons, belong in the next section. If there is no secondary armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|SK C/30 (37 mm)}}

The secondary armament consists of two 3.7 cm SK C/30 cannons in dual mounts located amidship on a platform near the second funnel. The cannons have a very low rate of fire of only 30 rounds per minute, making them very hard to use. Thanks to their high muzzle velocity and armour-piercing rounds, they can be used instead to engage coastal vessels at longer distances before they get within range of your 20 mm cannons.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2 cm/65 C/38 (20 mm)|2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 (20 mm)}}

The anti-aircraft protection of the Z22 Anton Schmitt is quite weak when compared to its contemporaries. It consists of a single 2 cm/65 Flakvierling automatic cannon in quadruple mount located amidship between turrets No.3 and No.4 and of five 2 cm/65 C/38 automatic cannons in single mounts with one located directly at the beam in front of turret No.1, two on each side of a hull next to turret No.2 and last two located directly behind the 3.7 cm gun mounts. The cannons, while not numerous, are still a quite strong short range anti-aircraft and anti-shipping defence.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|G7a (533 mm)}}

The Z22 is equipped with two quadruple 533 mm G7a torpedo launchers located amidship between funnels and between the second funnel and turret No.3. The torpedoes used are the standard G7a found on nearly all German bluewater ships. With a base speed of 81 km/h, a range of 6 km and a payload of 358.4 kg TNTeq, these are powerful torpedoes in terms of explosive mass. When upgraded with a torpedo mode, the speed decreases to 56 km/h while boosting the range to 14 km.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Z22 Anton Schmitt can be played as a brawler utilizing its superior rate of fire and large crew complement, crippling enemy ships and utilizing its fast torpedoes at close range. It can also be used as a support ship from behind, shelling enemies with constant rain of shells. Zigzagging is advised due to the vulnerable magazines on the stern when utilizing a full broadside. Two out of five main guns can be fire at the enemy when sailing head-on.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

Z22 ''Anton Schmitt'' was one of the six Type 1936 destroyers built for the Kriegsmarine (German Navy). Ordered from the AG Weser (Deschimag) shipyard in Bremen in 1936, she was laid down on 6 January 1938, launched on 20 September, and commissioned on 24 September 1939.

During the opening stage of the war, between the 10th and 11th January 1940, Z22 along with her sister ships was sent out for a minelaying operation around Newcastle, of which the minefield only claimed one small fishing trawler. On 26 January, Z22 caught fire in her boiling room due to leaking oil, which forced her to be sent back to Germany for repairs until the end of March 1940.

In April 1940, Z22 was assigned to Group 1 of the Norwegian portion of the Operation Weserübung in a German campaign to seize Denmark and Norway. The group was tasked to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Mountain Division to attack Narvik. The task group consisted of 10 destroyers set sail on 6 April 1940. On 7 April, the task group was spotted by British reconnaissance planes and were subsequently attacked by air formations, though the raid failed to damage any ships.

The task group arrived off the Ofotfjord close to Narvik on the dawn of 9 April. During this time, Z22 encountered the Norwegian coast guard boat Senja, of which she forced the latter to surrender. At 9:00 the ship disembarked their troops after mistakenly believed that a coastal artillery was guarding the mouth of the fjord and the troop was sent to capture them. Around 11:00 the troop was ordered to reboard and begin the attack on Narvik. However, as the ship was running low on fuel, Z22 was forced to stay behind while the rest of the task group retreated as planned.

On the dawn of 10 April, five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla made a surprise attack on the Germans at Narvik who did not anticipated their appearance. Z22's engine room was hit by a single 120 mm shell and a torpedo from the HMS Hunter, then the ship was finished off by a torpedo from the HMS Havock that broke her in half. The sinking killed 52 crewmen. The surviving crews then joined together with the 139th regiment as an ad-hoc infantry unit and continued their assault on Narvik.
