== Description ==
<!-- ''In the first part of the description, cover the history of the ship's creation and military application. In the second part, tell the reader about using this ship in the game. Add a screenshot: if a beginner player has a hard time remembering vehicles by name, a picture will help them identify the ship in question.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Armour}}
<!-- ''Talk about the vehicle's armour. Note the most well-defended and most vulnerable zones, e.g. the ammo magazine. Evaluate the composition of components and assemblies responsible for movement and manoeuvrability. Evaluate the survivability of the primary and secondary armaments separately. Don't forget to mention the size of the crew, which plays an important role in fleet mechanics. Save tips on preserving survivability for the "Usage in battles" section. If necessary, use a graphical template to show the most well-protected or most vulnerable points in the armour.'' -->
The Z32 offers very little additional protection except the basic hull with 16 mm of steel armour and a superstructure with 8 mm of steel armour. The gun shields on the single 15 cm mounts are 12.7 mm thick and the gun shields on the 20 mm Flakvierlings measure 8 mm of armour, therefore only offering protection from small calibre machine gun fire.

The only significantly armoured part of the ship is the twin 15 cm turret on the front, with around 30 mm of armour frontally and 20 mm on the sides, offering enough protection to resist some early destroyer rounds, thus making it last longer in bow-in engagements.

Having no additional armour means most cannon, autocannon and even machine gun equipped ships can punch through its hull, meaning this destroyer isn't any more survivable than its predecessors in terms of armour.

A small difference, however, is the slightly larger crew complement with 343 men, even surpassing the complement of the [[Z22 Anton Schmitt]] with 323 crew, and making this the 3rd highest destroyer crew count after the [[USS Sumner]] and the [[Leningrad]].

=== Mobility ===

<!-- ''Write about the ship's mobility. Evaluate its power and manoeuvrability, rudder rerouting speed, stopping speed at full tilt, with its maximum forward and reverse speed.'' -->

{{NavalMobility

|SpeedBackStockAB = 23
|TurnTimeStockAB = 126.7
|TurnSpeedStockAB = 43
}}

A larger gun calibre whilst retaining the same number of guns as on the regular Type 1936 results in a displacement of 3,597 tons and a speed of around 68 km/h, making the ship slightly slower than its predecessors, although hardly noticeable.

{{main|15 cm/48 KC/36 (150 mm)}}

The main armament of the Z32 comes in the form of 5 powerful 15 cm/48 KC/36 cannons, in 3 single mounts aft and one twin mount at the front. The large calibre of these cruiser guns result in a rather slow reload of 7.5 seconds and therefore a maximum of 8 rounds per minute. This however is compensated by the large amount of explosive filler and shrapnel the shells release on impact, as well as the noticeably better muzzle velocity retention, giving a much easier time aiming at longer ranges.
[[File:Type 1936A Weapons.png|thumb|350px|Weapon placements: 15cm main guns (red), torpedo launchers (green), 3.7 cm secondary weapons (yellow) and 2 cm anti-air cannons (blue)]]
The turret traverse of a mere 10°/sec for the single mounts, and 7°/sec for the twin mount encourages a more careful approach to targets at longer range, as a quick turn with the guns at close range is simply not possible.

The HE shell has a TNT equivalent of 3.91 kg and a muzzle velocity of 835 m/s, making it a great choice for medium ranges against destroyers of any kind.

The second shell type, a semi-armour piercing capped shell, has good penetration, a TNT equivalent of 3.32 kg and a muzzle velocity of 835 m/s. Furthermore, this is the only destroyer shell able to reliably threaten a large portion of cruisers at ranges of 5,000 m. An accurate player will be able to ammorack most early interwar cruisers, or at least cripple them severely.

The last shell, an HE with time fuse, can be used against aircraft if aimed carefully.

{{main|SK C/30 (37 mm)}}

The secondary armament is provided with 2 twin 3.7 cm SK C/30 mounts, both in the middle of the ship, one port and one starboard. These have a fire rate of 30 round per minute and provide antishipping capabilities against smaller patrol vessels with HE and AP, as well as minor anti-air support with time fused HE shells.

=== Anti-aircraft armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-AA}}
<!-- ''An important part of the ship's armament responsible for air defence. Anti-aircraft armament is defined by the weapon chosen with the control <code>Select anti-aircraft weapons</code>. Talk about the ship's anti-air cannons and machine guns, the number of guns and their positions, their effective range, and about their overall effectiveness – including against surface targets. If there are no anti-aircraft armaments, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|2 cm/65 C/38 (20 mm)|2 cm/65 Flakvierling 38 (20 mm)}}

The main anti-air defence consists of six 20 mm emplacements in total. Four in single mounts distributed in the front, aft and in the middle of the ship, and two quad mounts located in front of the bridge and between the second and third main gun. This gives the Type 1936A decent anti-air capabilities for close range encounters, although for longer ranges, this calibre is insufficient.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Fleet-Additional}}
<!-- ''Describe the available additional armaments of the ship: depth charges, mines, torpedoes. Talk about their positions, available ammunition and launch features such as dead zones of torpedoes. If there is no additional armament, remove this section.'' -->
{{main|G7a (533 mm)}}

The Type 1936A features 2 quadruple torpedo mounts in the middle of the ship, attached in the centre for a full traverse to both sides, enabling a full broadside of 8 torpedoes.

The torpedoes are the standard 533 mm G7a torpedoes of the German navy, with a maximum speed of 81 km/h, a maximum travel distance of 14 km and an explosive warhead of 358.4 kg of TNT. Not particularly outstanding in any kind or form, but still useful for screening capture points or chokepoints and close range panic launching.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the technique of using this ship, the characteristics of her use in a team and tips on strategy. Abstain from writing an entire guide – don't try to provide a single point of view, but give the reader food for thought. Talk about the most dangerous opponents for this vehicle and provide recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of playing with this vehicle in various modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Z32 is an excellent ship, boasting massive firepower. Due to its non-existent armour, good muzzle velocity, slow firing and slow traversing guns, the Type 1936A is best used on medium or long ranges, where evasive manoeuvres can be made and enemies have a harder time hitting you. Following this, the Type 1936A should not be in the first line of attack, it should be played more like a support, staying further away, and making use of its longer range weaponry. When engaging at close range, the insufficient rate of fire becomes apparent and multiple enemies from different directions can easily overwhelm the slow reacting destroyer, in these situations a precise shot in the ammorack can do the trick and is much more reliable than with smaller calibres. Furthermore, the large calibre is capable to overcome even the anti-fragmentation armour of American destroyers without losing much of your explosive power, and therefore countering those American vessels.

Having the semi-armour piercing (SAP) shell equipped gives the Type 1936A another, more unique role, namely the role of a cruiser killer, being one of the few destroyers to be able to do so. Since your destroyer is the definition of a glass cannon, even more when facing cruisers, it is important to stay concealed behind islands or simply by not shooting whilst closing in to a range of around 4-6 km. A few salvoes into the sides of the cruiser where the ammo is located is usually enough for most early interwar cruiser designs like the [[USS Trenton]], the [[Krasny Kavkaz]], or the [[Köln]].

Even before the outbreak of WW2, the Naval High Command of the Kriegsmarine was concerned about the firepower of its most modern destroyer vessels. Fearing they may be outgunned by comparable vessels of other nations, a study was initiated in 1936 about the possible upgunning of the Type 1934 and 1936 class destroyers with 15cm main guns.

The study quickly revealed that, although this upgrade was theoretically feasible, in practice it resulted in severe stability issues on the affected vessels and actually hampered their abilities more than increasing them.

However, whilst the Type 1934 and 1936 class destroyers kept their original 12.8cm main guns as a result of the conducted study, the Naval High Command didn't wish to abandon the idea completely and ordered for modifications to be made to the existing Type 1936 design in order to accomodate for the desired firepower upgrade.

This resulted in the creation of Type 1936A which was ordered into production in 1938 and consisted of a total of 8 ships. Although this class was designed to allow for the realization of the desired firepower upgrade, it still suffered from the same problems highlighted by the initial study and was known to have reliability issues with its steam turbines.

In 1940, the first of a total of 7 Type 1936 (Mob) destroyers were laid down. These were designed in an effort to address some of the known issues of the upgunned Type 1936 destroyers as well as to simplify their design in order to allow for shorter construction times.

Only a handful of the upgraded Type 1936A and 1936A (Mob) destroyers were lost in combat during WW2. In fact, more than half of the ships of these two classes survived the war and were used by several allied nations post-war, including the US, UK, USSR and France. The last remaining ships of this class were decommissioned from active service in the late 1950s.

Z32 herself was lost in an action near Ushant, defeated by the Canadian Tribal-class destroyers HMCS Huron and [[HMCS Haida]] on 9 June 1944. She was driven aground and later destroyed by bombs from Bristol Beaufighters.
