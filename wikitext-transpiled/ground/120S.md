== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The 120S is a [[M60]] hull mated with an Abrams turret. It inherits the usual M60 turret ring (flat 114 mm) weak spot with an even larger 70 mm flat neck. The hull is otherwise the same but unlike the previous M60's, players will notice additional side skirts on hull sides which might help against stray HEAT-FS shells. Turret on the other hand, comes from a [[M1A1]] model and is simply invincible to the most shells the 120S is likely to encounter. Sadly, putting the heavily armored Abrams turret onto the M60 hull increases the weight of 120S up to 56.2 tons. All while still retaining the same 750 hp engine which translates to 120S being slower than almost all the MBT's at its respective battle rating, and unlike the Israeli upgraded M60's, the 120S doesn't have any ESS.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

Being one of the slowest MBT's at its battle rating, 120S users are forced to play under the pressure of getting flanked by faster vehicles such as Leopard 2s. The slow speed of 120S means either the players have to spawn early to get to their desired positions or simply spawn late to protect objectives or spawn point. As a result of the poor stock engine, one can skip getting the top shell and LSR (as the M829 at the rank I is simply enough in terms of penetration and accuracy) in favour of mobility upgrades.

{{main|M256 (120 mm)}}

The 120S has the same 120mm M256 smoothbore gun used by the later Abrams tanks, and has the same ammunition options as the M1A1 consisting of M830 HEATFS as its stock shell, M829 APFSDS as a Tier I modification, and M829A1 as a Tier IV modification. In terms of battle rating, this is the lowest where these rounds are found with M829A1 undoubtedly being better than any other contemporary APFSDS round at this rank. It allows the 120S to comfortably tackle almost any target it comes across even from some distance away.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

[[File:Behind concretes.png|thumb|Being a tall MBT is not always a bad thing. With the superior turret protection, 120S can hold long lines as long as there is something to cover its weak hull.]]
The 120S must use its strongpoints to alleviate its handicaps. The MBT inherits the excellent 2nd-generation thermal view and the superb 120 mm M256 cannon. The fast turret slew rate and the quick reload is the cherry on top. Let's also not forget the blowout panels (up to 34 shells can be taken without worrying). Compared to the M1 Abrams experience, gameplay will be slow but much more satisfying due to the M829A1 shell, which will not care about the opposition. Players do not have to worry about dealing with annoying Leopard 2s or the reckless USSR MBTs.

Common tactics include performing hull down or covering hull behind solid cover. If possible, while reloading, simply turn the turret slightly to side to decrease chances of getting the breech damaged. Due to the fast reload, one can bait enemies by shooting. Care must be taken to have enough room between You and enemy to have the next shell ready before they peek. An even rare tactic is to use the poor armour of the 120S to bait shots, such as turning at the last second to the opposite direction of where enemy is aiming (most likely hull). At the end of turn, the hull must look sideways to the enemy, thus when done right, only the engine will be damaged.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very quick reload, up to 5 seconds when Aced
* Very good firepower, can comfortably tackle whatever it faces even at higher BRs
* Superb gun handling
* Effective hull down capability due to the M1A1 turret
* 2nd generation thermals for the gunner
* Unlike the most NATO MBTs, 120S can look behind due to high placement of the turret.

'''Cons:'''

* Poor mobility, compounded by poor reverse speed
* Poor hull armour made up of just RHA
* Very obvious turret neck that sticks out from the hull
* Lack of a commander sight hampers the combat effectiveness in simulator mode.

Late in 1999, General Dynamics Land Systems were looking to put a tank together that was suitable to export to countries as a cheaper alternative to the current main battle tanks. To attract buyers, it was decided to pair an M1A1 turret onto an M60A1 hull — a hull which was already in use with many countries around the world. This combination could also allow for countries to convert their existing M60 hulls into the M60 120S standard if required. In August 2001 the first prototype was completed and subsequently shown at the IDEF Exhibition in Turkey in October 2001. Having been proposed to countries such as Turkey and Egypt, there was no interest and the project was abandoned with only 1 prototype being built.
