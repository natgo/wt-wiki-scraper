== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]].

This self-propelled howitzer sports a 122 mm and is fully amphibious though in game it is not currently capable buoyancy.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The 2S1 has as much armour as light tanks such as the [[PT-76B]], light enough armour to be penetrated by the American .50 cal, so this tank is not the most protected.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour

'''Notes:''' <!-- From homogeneous armour plus structural steel gives 18 mm of armour -->
<!--  Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 20 mm thick. -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
In RB, the mobility of the 2S1 is tolerable. It reaches a higher speed quicker than most tanks in its BR due to it being built on a light chassis but bleeds speed quickly when turning. Turning the 2S1 from a stand still is incredibly slow and driving forward or reversing first is suggested to gain the needed momentum to turn.

In AB, the 2S1 moves like a light tank, accelerates quickly and has a high speed with good turning with some speed bleeding.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The 2S1's biggest weakness is high fire rate guns such as AA and other howitzers as both can eviscerate your vehicle very quickly. In RB, it is suggested to use your howitzer as it was intended: long distance destruction. Use your speed to get to vantage points. The 2S1 does not have much gun depression so you will need to use the environment for your own concealment and gun shooting angles.

In AB, it is quite the opposite, since there is no point in concealment in arcade your best being in the second line behind heavy tanks and mediums picking off enemy heavy's and mediums.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fairly mobile
* HE rounds have enough filler to destroy any target
* Great elevation angles

'''Cons:'''

* Long profile
* Very weak armour
* Crew placement not ideal
* Extremely slow turret traverse
* Slow turn speed from standstill

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The development of a new self-propelled gun for the Soviet army was based on the well-proven D-30 howitzer and the chassis of the MT-LB multipurpose amphibious towing vehicle. The D-30 towed howitzer was modified to be placed in the SPG turret, the MT-LB chassis was lengthened by adding a wheel pair to improve the driving performance and increase the room of the fighting compartment. After a year of testing, the vehicle was put into service in September 1970 under the designation 2S1 Gvozdika. Serial production of the SPG continued until 1991. The vehicle was produced in the USSR, as well as in Bulgaria and Poland under license. The 2S1 is still in service with the armies of many countries of the world.
