== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.''

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

The 2S25 "Sprut-SD" is a modern entry in the long line of Soviet amphibious tanks started by the [[PT-76B]]. It uses the lightweight chassis of the BMD-3 airborne IFV, which offers a great power-to-weight ratio, a hydropneumatic suspension, and equal mobility in both forward and reverse at the cost of extremely light protection and a rather large profile. The oddly-shaped turret packs a full-size 125 mm gun with autoloader, giving the Sprut the same firepower as the [[T-72B]]. Using this vehicle effectively can be tricky because it is significantly easier to spot and destroy than contemporary Soviet MBTs while lacking access to thermal optics for easy target acquisition, so it's important to make the most out of the high mobility to ambush enemies and retreat from danger.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
The 2S25 design consists fully of special alloy with lesser armour effectiveness than RHA (rolled homogeneous armour). This means that .50 cal rounds can pass through the 40 mm plate up to 500 m away and 20 mm autocannons rounds 8MBT-70, KPZ-70 and Leopard 2k) can pass through the 40 mm plate up to 1,000 m away. Other parts of the frontal armour are sufficiently angled to deflect .50 cal rounds and 20 mm shells at any range. Due to the weak armour, the rear and the sides and should always be hidden from the enemy as .50 cal rounds and 20 mm shells can go through at any range. Any other IFV armed with an autocannon will be able to destroy the 2S25 from any angle.

The 2S25 has a total of 3 crew members which makes the survivability of the vehicle is very low as any penetrating rounds will very likely destroy it in one shot.

The thin armour of the 2S25 makes it highly susceptible to large-calibre HE shells that will be able to overpressure the 2S25 even if it lands next to it.

{{main|2A75 (125 mm)}}

The Sprut-D is armed with a 2A75 125 mm smoothbore cannon, a similar cannon in performance as the T series tanks capable of firing the same munitions. It has access to the 3BM42 'Mango' dart, the same dart seen in the early T-72s and T-64s. While it lacks penetration compared to other rounds at the battle-rating (such as M900), it has very decent performance against anything it faces. It lacks punch when it comes to fighting in up-tiers as the dart might not be able to penetrate the frontal plates or mantlet of the MBTs. However, any well placed side shot should be more than enough to dispatch a target with no more than a single shot.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fairly mobile, decent turn rate
* Adjustable suspension allowing for clearance height adjustment
* Good ammunition choices for its BR: 3BM42 and 9M119 are more than good enough to handle most enemies it faces
* Access to the excellent 3OF26 HEF-T explosive round which can disable or destroy targets behind cover if the top of their turret is visible
* Access to laser rangefinder allowing for quick long-range shots

'''Cons:'''

* Lack of thermals for both the gunner and commander mean you cannot effectively hunt for targets at dusk or during night battles
* Relatively slow reload rate of 7.1 seconds
* Very thin armour, which does little to stop anything but MG fire and autocannon rounds at a distance
