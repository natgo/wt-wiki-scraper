== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Russian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]].

The 2S25M "Sprut-SDM1" is a modernized development of the previous [[2S25]] Sprut-SD and the capstone to the Soviet amphibious tank line. Although the external appearance is very similar, it is based on a revised BMD-4M chassis with the same engine and transmission as the [[BMP-3]]. Compared to the original Sprut, the 2S25M loses a significant amount of reverse speed and a small amount of horsepower, although the overall mobility remains good. The improvements are in the fire-control system, which now features thermal sights for both the gunner and commander and thus fixes one of the 2S25's original flaws. It also now has access to the powerful 3BM46 APFSDS round used by the [[T-80U]] to better deal with contemporary tanks. Although the 2S25M has impressive offensive capabilities, it routinely faces modern MBTs such as the [[Leopard 2A4]] and [[M1 Abrams]] that lessen or negate its mobility advantage. Thus, its playstyle demands even more caution.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->The 2S25M, also known as the Sprut-D, is a very capable vehicle which uses speed and agility over armor. The light armor of the Sprut tends to be a 'high risk-high reward' armor as it is only able to stop small firearms but generate little to no fragmentation from the penetration of a solid shot. However, chemical energy weapons such as HEAT and ATGMs will generate more than enough spall to defeat the crew. Armor is not to be relied on whatsoever, even against artillery fragmentation. Due to the oblique angles the frontal plates have, it is able to ricochet enemy projectiles but this is highly unlikely. One of the biggest drawbacks of the Sprut-D are the side-mounted ammo racks. In case of a successful penetration, these will be the first to detonate. It is advised to remove this racks to increase survivability of the platform. As with previous Russian light armor, the best armor is to not be seen by the enemy.

'''Armour type:'''

- Alloy ABT-102 (Hull, turret)
- Rolled homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=775|rbMinHp=442}}The Sprut-D leaves nothing to expect, high mobility and country-cross capabilities with a very powerful engine and reliable transmission. As seen in tanks based on the BMP-3 hull, the T/W ratio is impressive, giving a lightly armored vehicle a very high max speed as well as torque to advance even through the roughest of terrains. As its predecessor, it can reach speeds up to 70 km/h and 20 km/h on reverse with a gear change time from max forward drive to reverse in close to 5 seconds. It holds the ability to cross over water bodies, giving it an advantage in reaching positions no other vehicles are able to reach whatsoever. It has the ability to neutral steer, a feature not seen often in Russian vehicles.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

{{main|2A75 (125 mm)}}The Sprut-D is armed with a 2A75 125 mm smoothbore cannon, a similar cannon in performance as the T series tanks capable of firing the same munitions. While it doesn't fire the 3BM60 'Svinets-2' as the T-80BVM or the T-72B3, it fires the 3BM46 'Svinets-1' which is a very capable round in game. While it stays short compared to other rounds seen at top-tier, at 10.0 it is the best round seen followed by the M900. This round is able to pierce through all the tanks seen in game with some exceptions as the Leopard 2PL/A5/A6 turrets or M1A1/A2 turrets.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Sprut-D should be primarily used as a scout flanking vehicle due to its high speed, low profile, scouting capabilities and firepower. It holds primarily 3 uses:

'''Scouting:'''

As its name says, scouting. When on large maps, the scouting ability should be used at its full potential. The low profile and high speed make it able to crawl to cover fast and without creating much suspicion, while marking targets for friendlies to engage.

'''Flanking:'''

Due to the high speed and really powerful gun, it can be used to hit any enemy from behind. This tactic should be a "Hit n' Run", you should disable or destroy targets and leave before they can engage you. The powerful gun can take the heaviest of targets with ease if used properly

'''Sniping:'''

The capable optics, in combination with laser range finder and thermal optics, it is able to detect, target and engage enemy vehicles at all ranges thanks to any of its projectiles. Be aware of your ammo as it can only carry 22 on the carousel which can be consumed very fast, so make all shots count. Unless the commander is certain it has not been detected, moving between positions is adviced to ensure survivability, especially when the player respawns as an aircraft and is aware of the {{PAGENAME}}'s position.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

- Powerful gun
- Good cross-country capabilities
- Autoloader creates consistent reload even with two crew members
- Amphibious

'''Cons:'''

- Paper-thin armor
- Despite having an autoloader, the reload speed is decently long (7.1 seconds)
