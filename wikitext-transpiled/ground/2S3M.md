== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ("Akatsiya") was a modernized version of the 2S3 self-propelled artillery. As the first of three modernization attempts, it featured a new 2A33 howitzer capable of loading more advanced ammunition, increasing its effective range, reliability, and accuracy. The {{Specs|name}} also incorporated a single mechanized ammunition rack, as opposed to the 2S3's two. This change allowed for an increase in the maximum ammunition capacity from 40 to 46 rounds. Even though the changes weren't significant, they were seen as a step in the right direction toward bringing Soviet artillery efficiency more in line with that of western nations. The {{Specs|name}} served as the main production model of the series and was widely deployed in the Soviet Union and its allies. Further efforts to extend the service life of the series were undertaken in the mid-1980s and early 2000s, resulting in the 2S3M1 and 2SM2 variants, respectively. 

The {{Specs|name}} was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]]. In comparison to the SU tank destroyer series, it offers significantly different gameplay. Other than the obvious difference of not being a "casemate", it is very lightly armoured but highly mobile. Its cannon relies on the use of HE and HE-VT shells capable of disintegrating even the most heavily armoured tanks at its battle rating. The proxy shells are also sufficient against low flying aircraft, as they have a very capable fuse and a high explosive effect that can cause significant damage.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The survivability of the 2S3M is extremely situational. Due to having absolutely no effective armour to stop any munition but small firearms such as 7.62 mm machine guns, it is very vulnerable to all damage. However, solid shots such as APCR, AP or APDS have a chance to go right through the armour without causing any damage whatsoever. The armour of the 2S3M can also partially stop artillery strikes fragmentation depending on the distance between the explosion and the platform. The best armour of the 2S3M is not to be seen. As a howitzer with a very potent weapon, it should be never stay stationary after firing, as this can disclose the location of the platform and be killed. The engine in the front of the hull can occasionally absorb some shots, allowing the 2S3M to fire back and disable the enemy.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The 2S3M, while not the fastest tank at its BR, is quite speedy and able to get to key positions before most of the enemy. It takes time to accelerate and brake due to the heavy weight of the main gun, but it reaches the top speed fairly easily. It holds a max speed of 60 km/h, which is fast for a tank at this battle rating, and it often reaches its top speed. As it is based on the SU-100P hull, it has a very decent turn rate and reverse speed, being able to reach up to -14 km/h while on reverse. It has a very capable cross-country capability and when track module is researched, along with a much better turn radius.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|2A33 (152 mm)}}

The 2S3M has access to the 152 mm 2A33 howitzer, a very potent gun with a significant firepower at the cost of a long reload time. The performance of the gun is excellent, with a shell that has one of the highest amount of explosives at its rank. While it is slower in performance compared to the Type 75 SPH or the Bkan 1C, only going 655 m/s compared to the Bandkanon's 850 m/s and the Type 75's 750 m/s , it holds one of the most devastating rounds in game: the 3OF25. Holding more than 10 kg of TNT equivalent explosive mass, it is able to annihilate any lightly armoured ground vehicle with a direct hit anywhere and even the most protected vehicles can still be destroyed in one shot if aimed properly. 

Additionally, the 2S3M also has the 3OF25 (PF) shell. This is a proximity-fused high-explosive shell which detonates automatically when it gets close to a tank or plane, which allows it to explode above the roof of an enemy vehicle, destroying it in a similar fashion to a top attack missile. However, it will detonate on any features of the map, be that a rock, a mound of dirt, or even the ground. This, combined with its trigger radius (from 1 to 3 m) makes it little effective for shooting down vehicles hiding just behind ridge lines or obstacles, but effective against planes. The proximity fuse arms past 300 m, against closer targets the fuse doesn't work and the shell will perform just like the standard 3OF25 shell.

'''Notes''':

* The {{PAGENAME}} uses two-piece ammunition, composed of projectiles (yellow) and propellant charges (orange). Both have separate racks.
* Projectiles and propellant charges are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Hull empty: 13 ''(+33)'' shells.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|PKT (7.62 mm)}}
The 2S3M is also equipped with a 7.62 mm machine gun, which is useful for clearing bushes and fences in the path of this tank's high explosive shell. The PKT machine gun is not very effective against any planes directly. It serves more to attract a plane's attention and secure an easy destruction with the proximity shell, rather than being used as a weapon itself.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The 2S3M should be used as a support gun, able to take down even the heaviest of targets with a single shot. Teammates should be supported with the power of this weapon as well as the variety of projectiles available to it. It is not to be played as a frontline vehicle due to the immense reload time and aiming of the weapon. However it is a very good guerilla combatant and skirmisher if used as a backup for frontline vehicles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful HE shells can finish off anything with overpressure, like [[Panther II]], [[Tiger II (H)]], [[M4A3E2 (76) W]], etc.
* HEAT with a penetration of 250 mm is able to penetrate most tanks at the rank
* Has a variety of shell types to suit different preferences and situations: HE, HEAT, HE-VT, APHEBC
* HE-VT shell lets it take an anti-aircraft role and potentially harm lightly-armoured enemies behind cover
* Is turreted, allowing more flexible tactics
* -14 km/h reverse speed is good enough to retreat into cover
* Has a dozer blade to build a dirt cover

'''Cons:'''

* Thin armour, any weapon larger than a MG is threatening
* Poor -4° gun depression limits its ability in hilly terrains
* Long reload time
* Turret is huge with ready rack at the back, easy to get spotted and destroy with ammo rack detonation
* Slow turret steering speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
By 1964, NATO was equipped with the M109 self-propelled artillery. However, the Soviet army were still using artillery developed during WWII. During an exercise at Yavoriv military base, senior officials determined that the various types of artillery developed during World War II were not suitable for the war at that time. In order to make up for the technological gap with NATO countries, Resolution No. 609-201, issued by the Central Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on July 4, 1965, was finalized, starting the development plan for the new 152 mm self-propelled gun. In 1971, the Soviet Union passed the acceptance of the 2S3 self-propelled gun and began mass production.
