== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (also known as the '''Sturmtiger''') is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Fire and Ice"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7946-event-dreams-come-true-sturmtiger-en|"Dreams come true" 10th Anniversary event]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The survivability and armour of this vehicle can vary quite a lot depending on what type of vehicle you are facing. When engaging in combat with a vehicle which is in front of you, your frontal armour may at times actually be able to withstand hits. The issue is you have a big profile so hiding isn't exactly an option. Your armour is effective against low caliber rounds, and can protect you against some autocannon fire. The problem is that whenever an enemy with a high-peforming round is on the battlefield, which is able to penetrate your frontal armour, you wont' be able to survive much. The reasoning is due to how ammo is stored, which really hinders you. This is especially highlighted whenever an enemy, even if its a light tank, manages to flank you and shoot you from the side. Your armour is at its weakest there and the only thing on the other side is the rest of your very explosive munitions. In conclusion, to fully make the most out of your armour do not push into the frontlines, stay well hidden from danger.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This vehicle can be used in a wide variety of ways, from short range urban combat to long range artillery fire from behind cover.

Right after spawning, it's usually a good idea to set the gun sight's elevation to 100 or 200 m, to avoid having to aim upwards too much when shooting at a relatively distant target and to know easily if your shell will fly over a close obstacle or not.

Due to the extremely long reload, staying close to your teammates is strongly recommended if playing near the contact line, as you will need backup in short range engagements; after you've reloaded, bear in mind that there is a live rocket in your barrel that is vulnerable to pretty much any gun the enemy has, so try to shoot as soon as you've reloaded if you're being targeted or angle your gun away from the enemy if you don't intend to fire yet.

When shooting from a distance, try to get the tank on flat terrain, as inclines tend to somewhat throw off your sight's range indicators and, due to the very steep impact angles of your rockets, getting the aiming distance wrong by just a dozen meters could mean that your shell will fly over your target or hit the ground too far to damage it.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Massive 380 mm rocket ammunition, able to knock out any vehicle in a direct hit, or multiple vehicles within the explosion radius
* Adequate frontal armour can negate common tanks like [[T-34-85 Gai|T-34-85]], [[M4A3 (76) W|M4A3 (76)]], [[Comet I]]
* Due to its curvy trajectory, it can lob the rocket past sloped terrain or cover
* Decent mobility (~30 km/h on average) for its size, can keep up with even some medium tanks
* The smoke grenade mortar has 30 charges

'''Cons:'''

* Hard to aim due to curved trajectory, narrow gun traverse arc, and slow rocket velocity
* No gun depression, impossible to use in mountainous terrains
* Huge ammo racks essentially act as a gigantic fatal weakspot
* Very long reload time at 40 seconds (ace crew)
* Rockets can be destroyed mid-flight by MG fire
* If the launcher is loaded, the rocket inside of it can be shot, resulting in an ammo detonation

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Sturmtiger was a siege tank, based off the [[Tiger I (Family)|Tiger I]] heavy tank, armed with a 380 mm rocket assisted mortar. Fourteen were made, seeing service on the Western Front and the Warsaw Uprising.
