== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, casemate)
- Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)

- The belly is 15 mm thick.
- Mudguards are 4 mm thick.

The {{PAGENAME}} comes with a flat 50 mm plate on the front protecting the crew, tailed by a 25 mm thick plate just below it, constructed at an 80 degree angle (which provides around 70 mm of effective armour), and a 30 mm sloped plate below that, which mostly houses the transmission. The sides and rear of the tank destroyer are both 25 mm, and they both use mostly flat plates. The roof armour of the cab is 15 mm thick and flat, while the engine roof is 10 mm but slightly angled. Take note of the roof thicknesses because the 75/32 is often targeted by American CAS with .50s, who will often either attempt to kill the crew or at the very least kill the engine. Two crew members; the driver and the loader, sit on the left side of the tank, with the loader positioned directly behind the driver. On the other side of the tank sits the gunner (who is also the commander), and behind him sits the ammo. In between these crew members is the 75 mm gun, and covering them up to their knees is the transmission. The spaced out crew means that if the gunner is killed there is a good chance the loader and driver will survive, however, if the loader and driver are hit, they will likely die together, disabling the tank instantly. The transmission can act as an odd shield and can occasionally eat a stray round or two, sacrificing itself to keep the crew alive.

Using the same hull and casemate as the 75/18, the Semovente 75/32 offers little in the way of effective protection, with its primary defence against enemy tanks being its small frontal profile. The 50 mm frontal plate struggles to keep out even rank 1 British and US guns at close range, while the extremely cramped interior means that penetrations will often knock out multiple crew members or modules in a single shot.
Unlike many of its low-rank open-top contemporaries, the {{PAGENAME}}'s fully-enclosed design offers protection against small-calibre machine gun fire and against artillery blast and HE shells. However, it still is very vulnerable to strafing aircraft and heavy calibre MG fire.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Combat tactics

Thanks to its longer gun, the {{PAGENAME}} is effective as a tank destroyer at long range with the good penetration of its APCBC round. With a maximum penetration of 60 mm at 1,000 m, the vehicle will have no problem penetrating the angled front armour of many similar rank vehicles from a distance. Light tanks, armoured cars and SPAA are the easiest targets. The vehicle's effectiveness improves once the HEAT shell is unlocked, with 100 mm of penetration at all ranges. This allows for reliable penetration of practically all the Semovente's potential adversaries. Your most dangerous opponents are fast and agile light tanks such as the M22 that can easily flank the Semovente undetected and disable you from close range. Their speed and small size make those light tanks difficult to target for the Semovente's howitzer.

With the HEAT shell, the Semovente can make for an effective tank destroyer, provided you stay at a distance guaranteeing your survivability. The one thing to remember about the HEAT shell is that it sacrifices the one-shot capability of APCBC, meaning that larger tanks will often take multiple hits to disable while the reload time is very slow for the battle rating. Unlike the 75/18 M41, the HEAT shell has a higher muzzle velocity making it capable to hit reliably targets at long range.

;Notable enemies:

Many tanks are capable of easily disabling you. By order of lethality:

- Tank destroyers with long guns
- Howitzers with powerful HE shells
- Tanks with HEAT shells
- Frontline tanks with APHE shells
- Light tanks or armoured cars with autocannons

;How to defeat a {{PAGENAME}}

The {{PAGENAME}} has several weak spots:

- In a frontal encounter, the vertical front plate is the easiest to target.
- Shoot the lower front plate to damage the transmission and immobilize the tank if you lack penetration power.
- When flanking, aim for the weak sides of the casemate.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Low profile
- Decent 75 mm gun
- Has access to HEAT rounds
- Enclosed design protects the crew from artillery blast and HE shells

'''Cons:'''

- Overall armour is not very good
- Thin top armour; can be vulnerable to strafing aircraft
- Acceleration and speed leave to be desired
- Slower reload than other Italian 75 mm SPGs
- Lacks a machine gun

== History ==

{{main|75/18_M41#History|l1=History of the 75/18 M41}}

;Development

Mid-1943, some Semoventi 75/18 were with the improved 75/32 field gun. The gun sported a longer barrel and offered increased muzzle velocity, flatter trajectories, bigger accuracy and a better range compared to the 75/18 howitzer. It was produced to only 25 units as the Italian command ended up favouring the L/34 gun for the anti-tank role and later switched the production of Semoventi to the [[75/34 M42]].

;Combat usage

Some of these saw combat with the 135th "Ariete II" Armoured Division around Rome in September 1943. A number were confiscated by Germany at the Italy armistice and turned over to Fascist Italian forces.
