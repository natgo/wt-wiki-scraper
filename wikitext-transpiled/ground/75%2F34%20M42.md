== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, casemate)
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick while tracks are 20 mm thick and bogies 10 mm thick.
* The belly is 15 mm thick.
* Mudguards are 4 mm thick.

The {{PAGENAME}} shares the same vulnerabilities as the [[75/18 M41]] and the [[75/32 M41]]: a rather weak vertical armour front plate, weak sides and an even weaker roof armour and a crew of only 3 sitting in a cramped space.

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

;Combat tactics

Thanks to its performant gun, the {{PAGENAME}} is effective as a tank destroyer at long range with the good penetration of its APCBC round. With a maximum penetration of 64 mm at 1,000 m, the vehicle will have no problem penetrating the angled front armour of many similar rank vehicles from a distance. Light tanks, armoured cars and SPAA are the easiest targets. The vehicle's effectiveness improves once the HEAT shell is unlocked, with 100 mm of penetration at all ranges. This allows for reliable penetration of practically all the Semovente's potential adversaries. Your most dangerous opponents are fast and agile light tanks such as the M22 that can easily flank the Semovente undetected and disable you from close range. Their speed and small size make those light tanks difficult to target for the Semovente's gun.

With the HEAT shell, the Semovente can make for an effective tank destroyer, provided you stay at a distance guaranteeing your survivability. The one thing to remember about the HEAT shell is that it sacrifices the one-shot capability of APCBC, meaning that larger tanks will often take multiple hits to disable while the reload time is pretty slow for the battle rating. Like the 75/32 M41, the HEAT shell has a good muzzle velocity making it capable to hit reliably targets at long range.

;Notable enemies:

Many tanks are capable of easily disabling you. By order of lethality:

* Tank destroyers with long guns
* Howitzers with powerful HE shells
* Tanks with HEAT shells
* Frontline tanks with APHE shells
* Light tanks or armoured cars with autocannons

;How to defeat a {{PAGENAME}}

The {{PAGENAME}} has several weak spots:

* In a frontal encounter, the vertical front plate is the easiest to target.
* Shoot the lower front plate to damage the transmission and immobilize the tank if you lack penetration power.
* When flanking, aim for the weak sides of the casemate.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Decent 75 mm gun with a respectable reload rate
* Low profile = harder to spot
* Has access to HEAT rounds
* Decent top speed
* Large explosive filler in the APCBC round almost guarantees vehicle destruction upon penetration 

'''Cons:'''

* Overall armour is not very good
* Is vulnerable to getting flanked due to being a casemate tank destroyer
* Thin top armour; can be vulnerable to strafing aircraft
* Acceleration leaves things to be desired
* Shells have a rather slow muzzle velocity 

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
{{main|M15/42#History|l1=History of the M15/42}}

;Development

Following the success of the Semovente da 75/18 in its anti-tank role, the Italian command ordered in October 1942 the development of an improved version of the Semovente based this time on the M15/42 chassis and a 75 mm L/34 Breda cannon, a gun with identical performance to the one equipped on the P26/40 tank. The new vehicle was accepted in April 1943 and production started in May 1943 with an order for 280 Semoventi. Due to wartime shortages of materials and manpower, only 93 tank destroyers were produced by the Italians before the Armistice and only 60 vehicles delivered to their combat units. The Germans then seized control of Northern Italy and continued its manufacture, completing 80 more units alongside 36 already confiscated ones.

;Combat usage

The {{PAGENAME}} saw shortly combat action on the Italian side during the battle of Rome in September 1943 and more extensively on the German side along with the other Semovente variants in Northern Italy and the Balkans in 1944.
