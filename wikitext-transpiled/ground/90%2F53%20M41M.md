== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened as '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (hull)
- Cast homogeneous armour (gun shield)

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|}

'''Notes:'''

- Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick while tracks are 20 mm thick and bogies 10 mm thick.
- The belly is 14 mm thick.
- The gun mount is 15 mm thick.
- Mudguards are 4 mm thick.

Armour is not great, but the gun shield protects from .50 cal heavy machine gun fire from the front and the very sloped hull armour can bounce shots. The back is very vulnerable as your crew sits unproteted and can be knocked out by anything. One artillery shell behind you can disable the {{PAGENAME}}.

Despite that, it has better survivability than what people may expect from such a thinly-armoured vehicle. Because of its layout, the {{PAGENAME}} separates the crew into two different areas, the front compartment of the hull and the rear turret, with the engine bay in between. This also gives additional protection from the front side to the ammunition storage area, and so being destroyed by an ammo explosion is not a frequent thing.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 227|rbMinHp= 142}}

The mobility is good on flat terrain and even on some slopes, about the same as other Italian tanks on the same chassis. Due to the 90° horizontal fire angle, the {{PAGENAME}} can drive diagonally while aiming.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}
=== Main armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Due to its high penetration at close ranges, excellent turret traverse and surprising survivability, the 90/53 can perform quite well in CQC combat in an urban environment. The 90/53 is quite lethal to most tanks it comes across and can deal quite easily with vehicles other tanks typically struggle with, such as KV-1s. This comes at the sacrifice of an exposed rear, so it is typically advised to make sure that your rear is always secure and not to overextend from your allies. Alternatively, the high calibre of the shell does make the 90/53 viable at range, but the lack of ammunition and machine guns for rangefinding make this task quite difficult. When entering battle, a full load of Granata Preforante mod.43 is typically advised.

The 90/53 is extremely vulnerable to AA guns as they can typically shred the 90/53's thin armour and should be avoided at all costs. Strafing from planes is also a common annoyance, as its lightly armoured and semi-exposed crew are easy targets from the air. Try to avoid open areas and stick to places with limited visibility from the air, such as forests and towns where planes will have trouble spotting you. If a plane is targeting you it might be wise to back your exposed rear into a solid object, like a wall or a cliffside to prevent the plane from hitting your rear.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

[[File:90 53 M41M.jpg|thumb|90/53 M41M fighting at range]]
'''Pros:'''

- Wide traverse angle
- Exceptionally lethal APHE shells with outstanding penetration
- Acceptable reloading time
- If a shot penetrates the front, the engine and fuel tanks would absorb most of the fragmentation
- Now, there are 4 crew members, so it's more likely to survive strafing runs.

'''Cons:'''

- Poor gun depression
- Extremely poor ammunition capacity (8 rounds)
- Poor armour & exposed crew members in the turret
- Poor dispersion, especially without upgrades
- Mediocre mobility
- If you have 3 crew members and a plane strafes from behind, you're most likely dead

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Semovente M41M da 90/53 consisted of a 90 mm anti-aircraft gun mounted on the rear of a lengthened M14/41 hull and chassis. The engine was moved from the rear of the vehicle to a central position. Conceived and built specifically for anti-tank use on the Eastern Front after it was clear Italian forces had no answer to Russian tanks like the T-34, was hurriedly designed and rushed into production in early 1942. In practice the large gun overstressed the chassis and engine, so production stopped after 30 were produced and none were ever sent to Russia. Only a handful of rounds could be carried on the vehicle; it had to be accompanied by a turretless L6/40 tank used as its ammunition carrier.

Twenty-four surviving vehicles were formed into the 10th Self-Propelled Gun Unit (Raggruppamento Semoventi), divided into 3 gruppi. It was sent to Sicily in June, 1943, and was deployed against the US 7th Army in fighting in the Licata area, losing all but two of its vehicles. These last two vehicles were abandoned and captured in Messina when Sicily fell. The few left behind in Italy were seized and used by Germany.

One of these two Semovente was brought to Aberdeen proving ground to be evaluated. In 2012, it was moved to the U.S. Army Field Artillery museum in Fort Sill, Oklahoma where it was restored. It is likely the only surviving example.
