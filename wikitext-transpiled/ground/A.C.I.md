== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Winged Lions"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7469-event-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2021 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R.]] event.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
In general, the A.C.I is very good at head-on engagements, due to its very well armoured front for its BR. The sides are with a thickness of only around 45 mm relatively good penetrable at 2.7. Tanks using large-calibre HE shells are dangerous, because of the overpressure mechanics that will often take out the driver and the machine gunner as well as the transmission. The lower front is quite vulnerable, if shot, the transmission will most likely break down, the crew won't take damage usually.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The A.C.I's sloped frontal armour is great in medium range skirmishes since it will bounce most shots. The weak gun however forces you to come close to your targets to get a chance to penetrate. The armour is best used in combination with the A.C.I's good mobility.

Notable enemies include the Panzer III, the Marder III H and the early T-34s.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Diversely sloped frontal hull armour is sturdy against common foes, like [[M3 Stuart (Family)|M3A3 Stuart]] and [[M5 Stuart (Family)|M5 Stuart]], [[T-50]]
* Outstanding gun depression, allowing hull-down tactics
* Can easily frontally engage most enemies
* Fast reload allows quick follow-up shots

'''Cons:'''

* Only 44 mm of side armour
* Painfully slow reverse speed of -4 km/h
* Tightly packed crew
* Frontal turret armour is quite weak
* Slow acceleration
