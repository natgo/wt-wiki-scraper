The '''{{Specs|name}}''', also known as the ''AC IV Thunderbolt'' or the ''AC IV Sentinel'',  is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was released some time after [[Update 1.55 "Royal Armour"]]. Armed with a [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder (76 mm)|17-pounder gun]], it has a high firepower for the battle rating it is in, able to effectively fight any other tanks at the battle rating. The Thunderbolt is also a small and manoeuvrable tank able to exploit harsh terrain to target the enemy.

The AC IV is a well-rounded tank with superior armour layout compared to other British tanks at its BR; it can occasionally bounce shells from Tigers and Panthers if lucky. It is a relatively small medium tank in comparison to the common mainstay of the other countries, especially when compared to the American [[M4A2|Sherman]] tanks. The Sentinel also has a good manoeuvrability and power-to-weight ratio for the propulsion, able to accelerate to its max speed of roughly 30 km/h quickly and stay there on stable terrain. The tank has a great advantage of a decent reverse speed in comparison to other medium tanks of its calibre, with a reverse speed almost the same speed as forward. The addition of the 17-pounder gun also gives this tank a whopping high firepower for the size, so it can stand a chance against tanks of the same tier despite being out of the league in terms of armour.

The tank in the game is the version planned for serial production, so it has the hull of the AC III; unlike the actual prototype design developed, which used the hull from the AC I version.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The AC IV Thunderbolt is one of the few British tanks at this BR with sloped armour rather than the traditional boxy armour found in other British tanks. Its armour has a high tendency to bounce shells. This is obvious with the extreme slope on the from of the tank, and turret design. The armour itself is not thick, but thanks to the angle of it this tank can be very fierce competition to enemy vehicles. Although the armour is superior to that of other British tanks, it is not recommended to rely on it too heavily. Other nations, particularly the Germans, have no trouble penetrating the tank from any range. Because the crew compartment is relatively cramped, any penetrating shots can be fatal. The side armour on the Sentinel is extremely weak and vulnerable to SPAA flanking.

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour
* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull roof)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and bogies are 20 mm thick, tracks are 20 mm.
* The rear bottom area has a track placed there, providing 20 mm of extra armour.
* The commander cupola is extended outwards from the left side of the turret, creating a vulnerable unsloped area vulnerable to weaker guns.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The AC.IV has an overall good mobility, with an acceptable reverse speed not found in other British tanks (e.g., Challenger, Comet, etc.). The manoeuvrability in soft terrain can be significantly reduced and can feel sluggish.

{{main|QF 17-pounder (76 mm)}}
The classic Ordnance QF 17-pounder is a very powerful gun: its performance against Tiger I and Panthers is very consistent and satisfactory. The Sentinel offers a smooth gun handling, with a good turret traverse speed and a good gun elevation speed. It has an excellent gun depression of -10 degrees and offers a small silhouette when hull down, comparable to the Comet. Because British tanks do not have access to APHE shells, any shot fired must be accurate; always aim for crew compartments and vital components of enemy tanks.

Does not have improved zoom like the other rank III British tanks of similar BR, thus has worse zoom than many of its opponents, which may have variable zooms up to X5. Do not unnecessarily provoke German SPGs, as they have superior optics and are unlikely to miss.

In full up-tier, do not let Japanese medium tanks (e.g. [[ST-A1]]) get an upper hand at all costs, as they have optics eclipsing these entirely and can easily snipe A.C.IV from 2 km away, with accuracy modifications.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|Vickers (7.7 mm)}}
There is only one 7.7 mm coaxial MG with a very slow rate of fire, and no roof-mounted MG to defend against incoming planes. The small calibre of the Vickers machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help. While the belt capacity of the machine gun is adequate, its rate of fire is extremely slow for the battle rating.

Exploit the A.C. IV's manoeuvrability against the heavier tanks, plus the 17-pounder tank allows for a penetration through the enemy's armour to cause internal damages. The fast reverse speed makes the "shoot-and-scoot" tactic a viable method against the enemy, and should be the prime one as the armour of the Sentinel is not exactly the most durable at only 50 mm flat. However, the sloping nature of the armour could give the bouncing capability of the tank comparable to the [[T-34 (1942)|T-34]], it's even arguably much better. So while the weight class is definitely against the Sentinel, a chance is always there to take out the opposition. When compared to other British tanks, this tank lacks access to APDS rounds. Extra caution should be paid during full uptier matches as there will be many enemy tanks, particularly German tanks, that this tank will find difficult to engage from the front.

"Shoot-and-scoot" tactics are the best tactics to use with this vehicle. The Sentinel's armour does not let the tank be a brawler, so it must be more "sneaky" against the enemies. Another thing to note is the driver's hatch at the front of the tank. To avoid a frontally penetrating shot, always angle the driver's hatch away from the enemy.

The AC.IV can play any role in the game, since it is decent at brawling, close range, mid range, and far range.

===Development===
Australia began designing a tank in November 1940 as the ''AC I'', and was intended to be a cruiser tank weighing between 16 to 20 tons with a [[Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40 mm)|2-pounder gun]]. With no prior experience in producing a domestic tank, Australia sent a task force to the United States to study the [[M3 Lee|M3 Medium]] design to understand the in-and-outs of a tank. They also received the aid of Colonel W.D. Watson MC in December 1940 from Britain, who has many years of tank designing experience. The overall mission ended up having the tank design to have a similar concept as the Canadian ''[[M4A5|Ram]]'' tank, being based off the the M3 Medium chassis and mated with a domestic design of their choice for the upper part along with the incorporation of a suspension system of horizontal rubber cylinder springs seen on many early-war French tanks notably the [[H.39]] and [[H.35]]. The Australian attached the chassis with a hull and turret with design similarities to the British [[Crusader Mk III|Crusader]] tanks. The design started to become less of a cruiser tank and more of a medium tank by American specifications due to the attempt to up-armour and up-gun the tank to keep up with German armour development.

The first design was completed in February 1942 as the Cruiser Tank Mark 1 (AC I) and designated the "Sentinel". The design was simplified by using existing parts of current tanks and using a cast hull and turret. The entire hull being casted would be the first in history as many tanks of the era did not use such techniques. Although originally specified for a 2-pounder, it was then asked for a [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder Mk.III (57 mm)|6-pounder]] armament but due to the manufacturing of such guns not begining at the time in Australia they would have to use the 2 pounder for the first 65 produced. Two Vickers machine gun were used as the coaxial and hull machine gun the later having an armoured mount to protect its water sleeve resulting in a rather lewd looking front of which is made fun of to this day. With the power of three Cadillac V8 Petrol engines. It was unorthodox, but powerful enough to propel the vehicle. 65 of these tanks were made by June 1943 before being succeeded by a more advanced design known as ''AC III'', also known as the "Thunderbolt". It had better armour and an improved firepower in the form of the 25-pounder howitzer. Despite the bigger gun, the 54-inch turret ring was never expanded to accommodate for the gun's larger size, so the crew experienced a slightly cramped turret interior for the benefit of having a better high-explosive charge and armour-piercing capability. Other differences in the design was the removal of the hull machine gun and a different set-up of the three Cadillac engines. One pilot model was built and plans were made for a production for 25 tanks for further trials, but the program was terminated.

Another attempt was made to increase Australian tank firepower with the '''AC IV''' design. It first started when the designers check to see if the turret could mount the massive 17-pounder in use by the British to fight the heavier and more protected German tanks. When the tests proved successful, the 17-pounder was chosen to be the gun for the ''AC IV'', with a new and larger turret and 70-inch turret ring to improve crew comfort. These tanks were only made for evaluation purposes only and were never mass-produced for equipping the armoured units. However it would be the only commonwealth tank ever to mount such a gun.

===Termination===
The ''AC IV'' design, along with the entire Australian Cruiser tank program, was terminated in July 1943, ending with only 65 tanks produced and a few prototype models. The reason was that the funds were better spent improving the infrastructure than building new tanks due to the large number of American tanks such as the [[M4|M4 Medium]] that were being supplied to Australia. The AC "Sentinel" were all put into storage and kept until the end of the war. The only use the Sentinel saw was in the film ''The Rats of Tobruk'' in 1943 when a squadron of ''AC I'' tanks were modified to resemble German tanks.

===Survivors===
After the war, the Australian government disposed most of the tanks in 1945, most were sold off by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. Today, about six Sentinels survive in intact conditions across the world. One notably in the Bovington Tank Museum, and three in Australia in the RAAC Tank Museum, Treloar Technology Centre, and one in the United States in the Collings Foundation.
