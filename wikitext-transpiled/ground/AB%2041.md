== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' or '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a reserve rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* Gun steel (main gun, machine gun)
* Wheel (tires)

'''Notes:'''

* The wheels are 10 mm thick.
* The gun barrel is 10 mm thick while the coaxial machine gun is 5 mm thick.
* Viewports on the turret are 6 mm thick.
* Mudguards are 8 mm thick.

The armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is very weak, and will not protect it from any weapons, including some light machine guns at close range. From the front an inexperienced enemy may shoot the turret, which is the most heavily armoured portion, but even that is easy to penetrate by all anti-tank weapons. From the side many shots will over penetrate, killing only two of the four crew members at most; from the side the crew is well spaced out. From the front the crew members are lined up, making it an easy one shot kill. The ammunition stowage is a large target from the side, but it will not always explode when hit.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - Half the belt is composed of HEFI-T* shells, which will do negligible damage against armoured targets. However against aircraft and vehicles with exposed crew, they can prove deadly.
* '''Perforante mod.35:''' {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} - Intermediate usage until the better PzGr 40 can be used. Decent enough against light tanks and other vehicles from the rear.
* '''PzGr 40:''' {{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} - Highest penetrating belt. However, the post-penetration effects are very poor. In close combat, aiming for modules and crew members is advised. Its effects against angled armour is limited due to the nature of the HVAP shells, however the base penetration compensates such drawback.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Combat tactics

Even though the armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is lacking, if played to its advantages it can become a vital part of achieving victory over the other team. This armoured car has 2 main things going for it: a very good mobility and a very effective, fast-firing autocannon that can decimate enemies at close to medium range.

With these advantages in mind, there are several playstyles for this vehicle:

* The first option is to play a harasser role. Using the excellent mobility, the {{PAGENAME}} can get to the best positions on the map early and ambush enemy vehicles. Once you have struck and taken an enemy out, use the mobility to relocate to a new position and repeat the process.
* A second option is to use this vehicle to flank the enemy tanks while your teammates face them. Using your speed and mobility, you go around to take the enemy in a pincer movement.
* As third option, you can play it so as to get to cap zones before the other teams do, and afterwards use your vehicle as a support tank along with your teammates tanks taking up a position behind them and overextending when needed.

In addition to these roles, the AB 41 can be used against airplanes with its 20 mm autocannon.

;Notable opponents:

* [[S.35]] - Very well armoured but slow (flank if possible)
* [[B1 bis]] - Very well armoured for its BR and can be very dangerous with several cannons (avoid if possible)
* [[T-70]] / [[T-80]] - Strong frontal armour that will be hard to penetrate (but thinner side and rear armour), if you find yourself fighting one of these try to flank its position and catch it off guard.
* Most tanks of this tier can be penetrated easily by your autocannon, but be careful as some of these tanks will carry .50 cal machine guns which can penetrate your armour.

;Defeating the {{PAGENAME}}:

Being a very lightly armoured vehicle, it remains a vehicle easy to destroy: the 2 quickest ways to deal with the {{PAGENAME}} are autocannons and HEAT/HE projectiles. But any shell with explosive filler will do.
Avoid close quarters and engage from long distance to increase your armour advantage while decreasing the {{PAGENAME}}'s firepower.
You can also force your opponent to play on a terrain hindering its mobility (mud, snow, sand) to negate its main advantage. Aim for the driver or the engine to immobilize it, meaning almost certain death for an armoured car.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Reasonably fast on flat paved terrain especially roads
* Good acceleration
* Much quicker than other tracked competitors because it can steer both sides at 45° angle
* Can take very sharp turns at low speed
* Unlocks potent PzGr 40 APCR belt that is identical to the German 20 mm autocannons, giving it impressive close range penetration

'''Cons:'''

* The armour protection is only barely adequate at stopping rifle-calibre bullets, everything else will shred it
* Off-road mobility is lacklustre
* Sharp turns make it prone to tipping over
* Only 8 rounds per magazine, which is quickly expended
* Long reload for a small magazine
* Individual shells don't do much internal damage upon penetration
* PzGr 40 belt requires unlocking a tier IV modification
* Default belt is 50/50 API-T and HEF-T Shells
* API-T rounds struggle at longer ranges or even at slightly angled armour

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

An advanced automotive design, with the similar AB 40 it gave the Italian Army a modern armoured car during the Second World War. The {{PAGENAME}} had a 4x4 layout, with four-wheel steering and fully independent suspension. The freely rotating spare wheels, positioned midway along the sides of the hull, prevented the vehicle from bellying out when crossing obstacles. It also had a rear driver position. The AB 40 had 2 coaxial machine guns in the turret and a third rear-facing machine gun. The AB 41 had the 20 mm gun in place of one of the turret machine guns, and also had an increase in engine horsepower over the other design. In total 24 AB 40 and 560 AB 41s were built. They served in the reconnaissance units of armoured, motorized and cavalry divisions, as well as in independent recon companies and platoons, with 4 vehicles per platoon. The AB 40s only were used in North Africa, but AB 41s were active on all fronts, including 30 sent to Russia.

The Germans seized 37 AB 41 and another 20 in production when Italy fell in 1943. They used these, along with 102 AB 43s converted back to a 20 mm main gun, and known as AB 41/43s.
