== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

The AFT09 is a wheeled 4x4 Chinese ATGM carrier from late 1990s with up to twelve HJ-9 ATGMs onboard. It uses a shortened variation of the WZ551 chassis of the [[PTL02]] and [[WMA301]], but instead of a large assault gun turret, it has an unmanned ATGM launcher brandishing four missiles at a time. It invites comparison to the French [[MEPHISTO]] but is in fact far more deadly: the chassis has higher forward mobility and the HJ-9 missiles are superior to the HOT-2 in almost every respect. Thanks to the HJ-9's unrivaled penetration, sufficiently fast missile speed and good FCS, players can send even groups of the toughest enemies straight back to the hanger with a single hit each.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Players of the Chinese tech tree might think that the chassis of AFT09 looks very similar to that of [[PTL02]]/[[WMA301]]- in fact this is a correct assumption as this is also a variant of the WZ551 chassis aka WZ550 with a 4x4 config; while player of [[MEPHISTO|VAB MEPHISTO]] in France will find many similarities to it. Most of the features on WZ551 are identical on both chassis other than being a 6x6 (551) / 4x4 (550) respectively, especially the overall protection. To sum up the overall protection in a few words, it would be: paper-thin. For the protection, other than the lower part of the chassis, the whole vehicle can only stop rifle-caliber bullets; anything that is larger than a M2HB is more than enough to tear down AFT09 and its 4 crews with ease even at long distance; so be extra careful on where should AFT09 appear.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
Since AFT09 is based on the WZ551 chassis but reduced into a 4x4 instead of 6x6, WZ551 family mostly shares the same Detuz BF8L413F engine (albeit at a slightly reduced power output) and ZF 5S-111GPA transmission; this reduction in size also means that it goes faster than its other cousins (at 95 km/h)while has a slightly better but still horrible -8 km/h reverse, so make sure to plan your route to cover; the overall mobility is also good so make sure to utilize it for getting into a shooting position before the enemy does.

{{main|HJ-9}}

The main and the only armament on AFT09 is the HJ-9 ATGMs onboard, these 12 rounds of missiles are the 2nd generation ATGM of PLAGF from late 1990s. The missile airframe resembles the South African [[ZT3|ZT3 Ingwe]] used by the [[ZT3A2]] (a fellow wheeled ATGM carrier), but performance-wise it is much more similar to the infamous Russian [[9M133|9M133 Kornet]] used by the [[BMP-2M]]: an incredibly potent tandem-heat warhead with 1,200 mm of penetration is more than enough to even send the infamous Rank VII [[T-80BVM]] to kingdom come, and the 500 m/s maximum flight speed is superior to the Kornet's 300 m/s. The massive post-penetration damage leads to many OHKOs and the four kilograms of explosive mass will also overpressure light vehicles if that wasn't enough. The only below-average characteristic of the HJ-9 is that the explosive mass is lower than the Kornet and other contemporary Russian ATGMs, but this doesn't make much of a difference.

Although the HJ-9 is often said to be a laser beam-riding missile, it in fact uses a SACLOS system where the laser beam is presumably used to transmit coded information to the missile. As with other SACLOS systems in War Thunder, the HJ-9 cannot be fired on the move and cannot guide multiple missiles at the same time. Beam-riders like the Kornet are more flexible in these regards. However the HJ-9 is resistant to soft-kill APS systems and can be used against opponents like the [[PUMA]] and [[T-90A]] without any issues.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

Players of [[MEPHISTO|VAB MEPHISTO]] will soon find themselves home as AFT09 shared a very similar config of missile launcher and chassis; both vehicles are 4×4 and have a retractable launcher with 4 missiles. The HJ-9 is much deadlier than the HOT-2 however, with twice the flight speed, 25% greater raw penetration, and a tandem warhead, allowing players to be more aggressive. The AFT09 shares a similar chassis with the [[PTL02]], but thanks to its relatively lighter weight, it has a higher top speed than the latter and a slightly faster reverse speed; although this might not sound like much for such a lightly-protected vehicle, the mobility is enough to take advantageous positions before most enemies can. Be ready to counter enemy assaults or retreat as soon as the tides have turned, as the AFT09 takes a while to reload and has a poor reverse speed. Do remember that the overall protection of it is only rated for rifle-caliber bullets, anything larger is like a hot knife through butter, therefore cover and stealth are the most essential element to ensure the overall survival of the vehicle. Be especially careful of vehicles with top-attack missiles such as the [[M3A3 Bradley]] because they can very easily destroy the AFT09 behind cover. The number of smoke grenades on the vehicle might be low, but it is still enough for a retreat or two.

AFT09 has a trump card in hand- its HJ-9 missiles. At its current tier, there is practically no vehicle that can stop its 1,200 mm penetration missile that flies at 500 m/s, this also ensures its capability even at the top tier as HJ-9 can even penetrate some of the most infamous MBTs in-game with ease. Fitted with ±10° vertical limits and a 1st generation TVD, this also ensures players can find targets at a faster rate and deliver the fatal blow to enemies; alternatively, its 5.5 km range is also threatening to hovering helicopters since most missiles at this tier can barely fly 4 km, a precise hit on them will very likely knock them out right away if they are unaware of such a huge missile. Unlike the [[Shturm-S]] or [[BMP-2M]], the AFT09 does not have a proximity-fused HE missile available, so hitting attentive targets is difficult.

The large profile of the AFT09 is a double-edged sword. It is not difficult to spot the boxy wheeled APC chassis and the turret itself is very tall, which is a problem when moving between positions on the battlefield. A SPAA or IFV could easily turn the AFT09 into Swiss cheese with a quick burst. However, the height of the turret and the decent gun depression (-10 degrees is better than any other PRC vehicle) makes it possible to hide in hull-down positions behind hills and low cover while only exposing the unmanned turret, allowing the AFT09 to unleash its incredible offensive power without risking the crew. On large and open maps, an entrenched AFT09 can lock down an entire flank. This is not a risk-free strategy because incoming fire can detonate the loaded ATGMs and a single TOW-2B can end the party, so it is best to not stay in a fixed position for long and orient the hull to drive away quickly at a moment's notice.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely high 1,200 mm penetration, enough to finish off any tank even at high tier (e.g. [[T-72A]], Leopard 2A4, [[M1A1]])
* ATGMs have fast flight speed
* Thermal gunsight with high zoom (3x-12x) allows efficient targeting in all weathers
* -10° gun depression makes hull-down a viable tactic

'''Cons:'''

* Horrible -8 km/h reverse speed, fatal for a wheeled light vehicle
* Sluggish mobility on soft surface
* Can only fire when stationary which is dangerous in a sudden encounter
* Thin armour all around, can get penetrated by machine guns and shrapnel easily

== History ==

As the development of the previous generation ATGM has settled (HJ-73) and earlier HJ-8 were proved ineffective against the latest MBTs from both USSR and NATO, PLAGF was in dire for a new heavy ATGM with new guidance system as well as sporting their latest FCS. The new missile started its pre-development theorization in early 1980s and officially started its development in 1988, the result was the HJ-9 that has been finalized in 1995; the new missile was first shown in the 50th and 60th National Day Parade as the vehicles G phalanx and 14th phalanx respectively on a WZ550 chassis with different camouflage designs. In NORINCO catalogues, they also displayed a tripod variant as a standalone weapon system or onboard a open-top Iveco truck as its main weapon; the only export customer, Rwanda opted for an APC with a HJ-9A launcher on top instead.

=== [[wt:en/news/7826-development-hj-9-the-red-arrow-en|Devblog]] ===
Being based on a shortened version of the Chinese ZSL92 APC, the HJ-9 features excellent mobility, typical for most wheeled vehicles regardless of rank. Specifically, the HJ-9 can reach an excellent top speed of 95 km/h on paved roads thanks to its 290 horsepower diesel engine. On the other hand, the vehicle's comparably low combat weight and the resulting high power-to-weight ratio enable it to cross even rougher terrain with relative ease - just be wary of boggy areas and deep snow as these considerably hamper the mobility of wheeled vehicles in general.

In most cases, wheeled vehicles don't feature heavy duty protection so as to not hamper their mobility. This principle also applies to the HJ-9. Engineers only equipped the HJ-9 with steel armor up to 12 mm in thickness as well as bulletproof glass for the windows. Needless to say, this makes the HJ-9 highly susceptible to everything but small arms fire and shrapnel. Aircraft in particular may prioritize the HJ-9 over other targets due to its poor protection and lack of a defensive roof-mounted machine gun. As a result, commanders are best advised to make the most use out of the HJ-9's excellent mobility and constantly change position after each engagement to ensure they remain an elusive target on the battlefield.
