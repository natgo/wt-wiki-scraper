== Description ==
<!--''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.''-->
The '''{{specs|name}}'''was a cavalry tank designed and fielded during the pre-war period. The tank fielded the same 47 mm SA 34 gun used by the Char B1 and was used on mainland France between 1936 and 1937. The tank was considered poorly armoured, even for a cavalry tank, and was re-armed with a 20mm gun turret and shipped to North Africa. The vehicle was later replaced by the H.39 in late 1939. It should be noted, that the earlier Char D1 and early Char D2 infantry tanks did see wide service, sharing the same gun as the AMC.34 but in a different body, with increased armour at the cost of mobility, 160 D1s were built and served in North Africa.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]].  While originally a reserve vehicle, it was later superseded in status as a reserve vehicle in [[Update 1.93 "Shark Attack"]] by the AMD.35. It features a well-armoured turret on a fragile chassis with a subpar SA34 L/30 cannon as the main armament. The vehicle features mediocre mobility, armour and firepower. The turret is well armoured, but with such a big chassis, is easy to get shot at the front or the sides. Aside from that, its SA 34 cannon has a very poor reload speed, lower than most tanks around its BR, and with 27mm of penetration at point-blank ranges, the vehicle is not beginner-friendly at all and can be considered inferior to most rank I tanks. It requires great skill and map knowledge to be used with effectiveness, try to engage at close quarters and with allied support for increased chances of survival..

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!--''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?''

''If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.''-->
The AMC.34 YR fits all definitions of a light tank. It has very little armour and very little space - it can't take a shot. When looking at it frontally, the AMC.34 YR has a big ammo rack on the left, and both crew members on the right, meaning that any shot that penetrates will almost certainly destroy the tank. When looking side-on, the AMC.34 YR has two other ammo racks in the middle, and right behind those, there are crew members (if any of them are taken out, the tank is destroyed); the only way that this tank can survive when shot side-on is if the enemy shoots too far back, where there's only a single fuel tank. However, with short reloads at rank I, the enemy is likely to reload in-time to finish the job.

Generally, the AMC.34 YR can't get shot, if it does - it is destroyed. This is easier to accomplish in realistic battles, where bushes can be used as cover, as well as buildings. However, in arcade battles, the AMC.34 YR has to be played extremely carefully and the player should expect the enemies to know their exact location.

The {{PAGENAME}} is one of the more mobile rank I French tanks. It can reach speeds of up to 40 km/h when on hard, flat ground and it turns rather well. However, its speed can't be used to avoid enemy fire since the maps at this rank are quite small, and usually enemies are still able to align their shots due to very short reload speeds. Nevertheless, the player should move around the map when playing the {{PAGENAME}} especially in realistic battles. If the enemies don't know your position, they can't shoot you - and you can't take any chances.

The small calibre of the MAC 31 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.

Play carefully. The AMC.34 YR is the opposite of survivable, so you can't get shot, at all. Your gun will struggle to penetrate early Italian tanks and some German tanks, which you will encounter the most, so learn the weak spots and flank. Below are some strategies that may help you out when operating the AMC.34 YR:

;Hull-down:

* With its thickest armour being on the turret, this tank performs fairly well in ambush positions near a choke point: find yourself a rock, trench or hill and poke your turret out. You should have a good view of the battlefield while bouncing most incoming rounds, although don't take your chances and use cover to hide from the enemies. Even if you found a good spot, reposition every now and then since you will be spotted and dealt with in no time.

;Support:

* Assisting your allies will be your best use of this tank, whether by breaking tracks/guns of your enemies or by scouting and marking enemies on the map (or calling them out in the chat). Do try to steal targets from your allies, since its the best you can do. However, do keep in mind that your penetration and reload time are awful, never engage anything alone, or without cover nearby, since you will likely be destroyed.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The APHE shell has good post-penetration damage
* The turret is well armoured and angled
* The MAC 31 machine gun as coaxial MG is good

'''Cons:'''

* The cannon has a weak penetration power
* Reload time is twice as slow as any other tanks of similar calibre
* Poor mobility for a light tank
* The armour is overall thin and lacking
* Only 2 crew members are lined up and cramped: easy to disable with a single shot
* The ammo racks are badly placed and prone to detonate when hit

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The AMC.34 was a pre-war cavalry tank design that was not accepted for wide service, being considered insufficiently armoured. A dozen pre-series vehicles were equipped with the APX1-model turret, also used by the pre-war Char B1 tank and mounting the 47 mm SA 34 gun (as shown in-game), and used by the French 4th Cuirassiers in 1936-37, before being re-armed with 20 mm gun turrets and shipped to the French North African colonies for service there. They are believed to have been all replaced by H.39 tanks and taken out of service in late 1939.

The earlier Char D1 and the early versions of the Char D2 infantry tanks, which shared the same short 47 mm gun (and turret, in the case of the early-production D2) as the in-game AMC.34 but on different vehicle bodies (better armoured than the AMC.34, but also slower), did see wartime service. France produced 160 D1s between 1932 and 1935, which equipped 3 tank battalions in North Africa in 1939. One of these battalions, the 67th, would be recalled to fight in the fall of France. After the French defeat, the Germans allowed the Vichy regime to keep 60 of their remaining D1s in North Africa, where they fought against both the American landings at Oran in late 1942 and the German occupation of Vichy Tunisia around the same time. The estimated 50 early-model D2s that were produced between 1934 and 1936 with the same APX1 turret (later production vehicles of the D2 line would be up-gunned to carry the better 47 mm also found on the in-game Somua and B1 bis) also served during the fall of France, in their case with the 19th Tank Battalion under De Gaulle.
