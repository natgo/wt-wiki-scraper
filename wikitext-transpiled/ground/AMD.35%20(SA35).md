== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Sky Guardians"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8186-event-repair-factory-en|"Repair Factory" event]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Being an armoured car, the AMD.35 (SA35) has poor protection, as the vehicle is only protected against rifle-calibre MG fire. The sides are easily penetrated by heavy MG fire, but unlike most armoured cars the AMD.35 (SA35) has enough frontal armour to survive most heavy MG fire from a distance above 500 m and practically all heavy MG fire to the front of the turret.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* Wheel (tires)

'''Notes:'''

* Wheels are 10 mm thick.
* Storage boxes and mudguards are 5 mm thick
* Belly armour is 7 mm thick.
* The cupola is just a ventilation cupola and 7 mm thick.
* Internal plates (7 mm thick) separate the crew compartment from the engine compartment, as well as the engine compartment in half and cover the commander from the top and the rear.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The AMD.35 (SA35) can reach really good high speeds on road, but has poor cross-country performance. Notably, its wheeled configuration means the car will not get accurate fire when on the move and it will turn in an arc. Meanwhile, its good reverse speed can possibly save the car from an unfortunate encounter.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|SA35 L/32 (47 mm)}}The SA35 gun offers a reasonable penetration power at its battle rating. Its average muzzle velocity allows for a rather flat firing trajectory but the accuracy drop is noticeable from 700 m distance and becomes a handicap over 1,000 m. The rotation speed of the turret is slow compared to other tanks at the same rank or battle rating. Elevation and depression angles of the gun are important, allowing you to fire from unusual positions (behind a ridge, on a slope, etc.). Your recoil is nonexistent. The reload times of the gun are in line with other light tanks at the same BR. The average penetration power and the absence of post-penetration damage from the solid shot are the biggest weaknesses of the armament. This will bring you to have to shoot enemy tanks repeatedly to destroy them entirely, while being in close proximity to maximize your penetration power.

==== Ammunition ====
The AMD.35 (SA35) has a limited choice of ammunition:

* '''Mle1935''': APC; a solid shot with average penetration and no explosive filler. Make sure to target modules and crew positions to maximise the damage. Knowledge of enemy vehicle layouts is essential with this type of ammunition.
* '''Mle1935 HE''': HE; useful for destroying open and very lightly armoured vehicles, pack 3-2 HE shells due to a lack of a coaxial machine gun.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The AMD.35 (SA35) is best thought of as an armoured car with an adequate gun. Although it has poor armour protection, like most armoured cars, it is mobile, lethal, and surprisingly survivable.

Its gun is a 47 mm cannon with adequate penetration values. This weapon will have no problem dealing with most enemies at this rank. Just try to stay under 300 m of range, or else there may be significant deviation in the rounds. However, be aware that the post-penetration damage is quite small so it is advisable to aim for critical components such as the breech or the gunner first. It's also important to note the lack of a machine gun, which can become a problem when facing SPAA and other lightly armoured vehicles, and so bringing a few HE shells is necessary to deal with them in a timely manner.

The AMD.35 has a great speed advantage on roads and paved surfaces. However, it has poor mobility on soft terrain, and struggles to go uphill. Even when driving on roads, quick turns cause the vehicle to lose much speed. Finally, the AMD.35 has quite ineffective brakes. It is recommended that the tanker use the AMD.35's great on-road speed to quickly attain a firing position at the beginning of a match, and move quickly around the map to avoid detection. If a good firing position is found, then the AMD.35 will be able to utilise its cannon to great effect.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

* [[Pz.II (Family)|Pz.II]] and other tanks with autocannons can shred your armour and the modules behind it. Generally, it is advised not to engage head on but if you are forced to, then make sure you get off the first shot before they start spraying.
* [[:Category:Anti-aircraft vehicles|SPAAs]] - Nearly every anti-aircraft vehicle at the rank will be able to penetrate and destroy the AMD.35 with ease. Not to mention that SPAAs guns have high rates of fire. As with any other vehicles, it is advised to shoot first. Certain SPAAs which are commonly underestimated like the French [[P.7.T AA]], and [[CCKW 353 AA]] and the American [[M15 CGMC]], and should be especially noted, as despite not having 20 mm autocannons like their Axis counterparts, they all have weapons capable of efficiently knocking out an AMD.35.
* The [[Matilda III]], [[SU-122]], [[T-50]] and some other tanks can have over 50 mm of armour which is is thick enough to stop you from penetrating them from front or even from the sides. It's advised to avoid engaging them from the front and instead marking them on the map for your teammates to deal with or attacking them from the side or back while they are distracted. The [[Matilda (Family)|Matilda]]'s and [[Valentine (Family)|Valentine]]'s should be noted as they are practically invulnerable to your cannon.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High straight-line top speed on paved surfaces
* Excellent reverse gear
* Adequate penetration and shell velocity
* Quick reload speed
* High crew count and good survivability
* Adequate gun depression

'''Cons:'''
