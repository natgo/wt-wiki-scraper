== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} lacks protection against heavy machine gun fire and is susceptible to damage by light machine gun fire. The crew is located in a rather small compartment, making the armoured car prompt to being knocked out by a single shot from almost any direction. It is also vulnerable to overpressure, meaning chemical energy ammunition will take out your vehicle regardless of where they impact. A kinetic energy ammunition can damage your AML through the projectile itself or the spalling generated but the inflicted damages are lesser and has a higher chance to knock out the crew members or critical modules than to destroy the vehicle. It should be noted that the thin armour has a chance to not activate fused shells like APHE, APCBC, etc, although it will trigger HEAT, HEATFS, HE and ATGM.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* Structural steel (mudguards, storage boxes)
* Wheel (tires)

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 3 and 4 are first stage ammo racks. They total 10 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
** These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 1 - 2.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammunition from rack 1 then 2 into ready rack 4 then 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Is very short and narrow, can effectively hide itself and squeeze in-between tanks while fighting in a city
* High speed on road (~50-80 km/h), faster than tracked light tanks like [[M41A1]], can sometimes rush through enemy fire while taking superficial damage
* 90 mm HEATFS is lethal thanks to its high penetration. Can go through almost all common tanks like [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]] or [[T-44]], although it will sometimes fail to do damage to tanks like [[T32E1]]
* -18 km/h reverse speed can pull it out of a dangerous situation rather quickly
* Smoke grenades can conceal the vehicle when needed
* Stable hull, driving at maximum speed on flat terrain does not affect accuracy too much

'''Cons:'''

* Cannon itself isn't stabilised in any way, needs significant amount of time to aim after driving over a hill or any slope (particularly with the low "targeting" crew skill)
* Must be used without expert crew against elite crews of other nations, making it instantly inferior to the same tank of other nations at first
* Armour is so poor that even German 7.92 mm can penetrate it at close range, laughably easy to destroy with HMG even over long range, especially from the side
* HEATFS has limited post-penetration damage especially against spacious tanks like [[M60 (Family)|M60]]
* HEATFS of AML-90 is slightly slower than general tank ammunition and thus its trajectory is quite curved, long range shots require practice
* Wheeled design and low mass makes it extremely sluggish when turning or driving through obstacles
