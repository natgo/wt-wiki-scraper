== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The AML-90 was developed by the French company Panhard in the late 1950s, as a response to a commission by the French Ministry of Defense. It was based on the earlier AML-60, which mounted a 60 mm mortar as its main weapon. The AML-90 replaced the mortar with a DEFA low-pressure 90 mm rifled gun capable of firing high-explosive and high-explosive anti-tank shells. As the developer of the AML-90, France used it extensively, using it for police work, counter-insurgency, and reconnaissance among other tasks.

Introduced in [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]], the  '''{{Specs|name}}''' relies heavily on its speed and good positioning to avoid getting killed, since the AML-90's lack of armour means that any shot, even heavy machine guns, can and likely will result in death. Therefore, it should be used in flanking manoeuvres, harassing enemies, capturing points, and supporting allies. Its 90 mm cannon is adequate for this job, however the use of a HEAT projectile means that one-shots are rare. Since it is a wheeled vehicle, it may get stuck in some terrains, and as such using it in flat areas should be prioritized.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* Structural steel (mudguards, storage boxes)
* Wheel (tires)

'''Notes:'''

* Wheels are 10 mm thick and a spare wheel covers the left side of the hull.
* Storage boxes and mudguards are 5 mm thick.
* The belly is 8 mm thick.
* The gun barrel is 20 mm thick.

The {{PAGENAME}} lacks protection against heavy machine gun fire and is susceptible to damage by light machine gun fire. The crew is located in a rather small compartment, making the armoured car prompt to being knocked out by a single shot from almost any direction. It is also vulnerable to overpressure, meaning chemical energy ammunition will take out your vehicle regardless of where they impact. A kinetic energy ammunition can damage your AML through the projectile itself or the spalling generated but the inflicted damages are lesser and has a higher chance to knock out the crew members or critical modules than to destroy the vehicle. The thin armour has a chance to not activate fused shells like APHE, APCBC, etc, although it will trigger HEAT, HEATFS, HE rounds, and ATGMs.

{{main|DEFA F1 (90 mm)}}

The AML-90 uses a powerful 90 mm DEFA F1 low pressure cannon. The AML-90 comes with a stock OCC 60-62 HEATFS ammunition, capable of penetrating most tanks at its BR at any distance. It should be noted that the AML-90 only carries 20 rounds at max, meaning all rounds should be aimed for a kill shot as the small capacity will make the tank ammunition deplete faster than in other tanks if precautions are not taken. Commanders should always shoot to kill in the least shots necessary, know center of mass, ammunition racks, etc to successfully engage a target.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 3 and 4 are first stage ammo racks. They total 10 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
** These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 1 - 2.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammunition from rack 1 then 2 into ready rack 4 then 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

The small calibre of the A-A-F1N machine guns makes them largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. They still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
AML-90 should be primarily used as a scout flanking vehicle due to its high speed, low profile, scouting capabilities and firepower (tremendous for such a small vehicle). The AML-90 has primarily 3 uses:

'''Scouting:'''

As its name says, scouting. When on large maps, the scouting ability should be used at its full potential. The low profile and high speed make it able to crawl to cover fast and without creating much suspicion, while marking targets for friendlies to engage.

'''Flanking:'''

Due to the high speed and really powerful gun, the AML-90 can be used to hit any enemy from the back. This tactic should be a "Hit n' Run", you should disable or destroy targets and leave before they can engage you. The powerful gun can even be able to take on a [[Maus]] or [[E-100]] if used properly (320 mm of penetration at all ranges at 0°). Use smoke to cover your trail when you have been spotted.

'''Sniping:'''

Despite the optics not having a huge zoom, it is enough to be able to detect, target and engage enemy vehicles at all ranges thanks to the HEATFS round. Be aware of your ammo as it can only carry 20, so make all shots count. It also creates a relatively small smoke trail when firing compared to other cannons at the battle rating (105 mm, other 90 mm, 122 mm) thanks to the muzzle brake. Bushes can also be used to make this vehicle invisible due to its low profile. A big bunch of branches can cover almost 70% of the front of the AML-90, making it a moving and deadly bush. It also creates a small engine sound that will be, most of the time, masked up by other tanks, giving you a stealth capability which can be exploited in urban combat.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Its very small size makes it easy to get around and avoid shots
* 320 mm penetrating HEATFS ammo should be able to take care of any expected enemies
* Has access to smoke grenades and smoke shells that will allow it to move around unseen
* Has a roof mounted 7.62 mm that can be good to shoot planes and open-topped vehicles
* Armour is thin enough to not fuse some high calibre APHE shells, most notably from Soviet cannons

'''Cons:'''

* Prone to overpressure damage
* Only has a crew of 3, a single shot will most likely knock the {{PAGENAME}} out
* Only 10 to 12 mm of frontal armour, can get penetrated by .50 cal HMG fire and other small-calibre weapons
* Very low ammo count of 20 shells
* Terrible brakes, it will take you 20 metres to stop
* Wheeled vehicle mobility: any obstacle makes you lose a lot of speed (walls, fences, potholes, hills)
* Taking smoke shells means having to take less HEATFS on the already limited ammo storage

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

===Design===
The AML-90 is a variant of a light armoured car developed by the French company Panhard in the late 1950s. It was designed to replace the older and less capable scout vehicles that the French Army had used during World War II, such as the AMD 35, Laffly S15, and the Daimler Ferrets. The AML family of cars had a four-wheel drive chassis, a three-man crew, and the AML-90 had a 90 mm low-pressure gun that could fire high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shells. The AML-90 was also very agile and compact, making it suitable for reconnaissance and raiding missions in various terrains.

===Development===
The first prototypes were tested in 1959 and the vehicles entered service in 1961. The early versions were armed with a 60 mm mortar in the turret. A new turret integrating a 90 mm cannon was developed the same year they entered service. The AML was an export success with many armies around the world adopting the AML-90, in particular African or Middle-Eastern countries with limited budgets. Almost 5,000 units were produced.

===Combat usage===
The AML-90 saw service in the French Army and in numerous armies around the world, the most renowned foreign operators being South Africa, Spain, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The AML-90 saw combat action during many conflicts throughout the years: Six-Day War, South African Border War, Iran-Iraq war, Toyota War among the most know and remains in service until today.
