== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Recon Machinegun-car AMR 35 ZT3) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]]. Featuring a quick firing "stabilized" 25 mm gun, good mobility and bulletproof armour, it differs greatly from other rank 1 French tanks while offering similar gameplay to the Soviet [[ASU-57]]. It is arguably the best first French tank to research.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

With only 13 mm all-around, this is not a frontline tank and it should fear artillery barrages, bombs and strafing aircraft. Distance is your main defense since most rank 1 guns are inaccurate, often missing such a small target. Any penetrating shot from another tank can easily disable this tank.

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, superstructure)
- Cast homogeneous armour (cupola)

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 116|rbMinHp= 73}}

This light chassis can be carried wherever it is needed in no time. It is quite fast and manoeuvrable but loses a good amount of speed when going off-road due to narrow tracks.

The 25 mm SA 34 L/72 cannon is a breath of fresh air among its likes: it has decent penetration values and a 3.9 s reload time. Its good ballistic properties (flat trajectory) makes it easy to aim at usual combat ranges (~500 m). This gun comes with an enjoyable feature: it has a LOCK, which is a primitive form of stabilizer. It enables this tank to reliably shoot on the move in middle to far range (100 to 500 m). Or else, one can stop and shoot faster than other rank 1 tanks. The MAC 31 is a decent coaxial MG. The main downside this gun platform has is its limited gun traverse, which makes close-range engagements very hard.

'''Notes''':

- As they are modeled by sets of 2, shells disappear from the rack only after you fire both shells in the set.
- The visual discrepancy concerns the total number of shells as well as the number of shells per rack:
  ** 72 shells are modeled but you can pack 78 shells.
  ** Rack 3 is modeled as 24 shells but contains 30 shells.

=== Machine guns ===

The small calibre of the MAC 31 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This is a good introduction to a typical tank destroyer's gameplay: a good gun on a fragile chassis and even more. With its low silhouette, the AMR can completely hide itself behind a wide variety of terrain features: wrecked tanks hulls, shallow hills, rocks, brick walls... Staying away from the fight and sniping for unsuspecting enemies. When spotted, choosing to reverse back into cover is a good decision.

'''Classical TD:'''

Hiding behind terrain and obstacles, using its good gun depression while staying at some distance from the target is the best way to use this TD in most situations. Applies well on any non-urban terrain.

'''Sneaking TD'''

This is a very situational way to play the AMR, mostly efficient in RB and SB games but still applicable to AB matches. This tactics relies on this tank's low silhouette: it can easily hide behind almost anything. Use this tactic to sneak onto an enemy's back or to lure the enemy team into a trap (needs a complying ally). Being a ninja AMR applies well to urban combat.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Fast compared to French low-tier vehicles
- The 25 mm gun, though small, has a high penetration power and is stable on the move
- Small calibre rounds can penetrate narrow spots unreachable for bigger calibres
- The APC round has good post-penetration damage
- -10° of gun depression angle
- Competitive reload time
- Low silhouette
- Crew are not lined-up from the front
- Asymmetric gun position allow for original gameplay
- Side armour is actually thicker than frontal armour

'''Cons:'''

- Two-men crew means that any knocked crew member ends up either as immobilization or back to the garage
- Gun traverse is fairly limited, even for a TD casemate design
- Anything punching harder than a MG will shred this vehicle
- Narrow tracks offer poor off-road mobility
- Big cupola makes a good target
- Limited ammo choice

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Automitrailleuse de Reconnaissance (AMR) 35 was an improvement over the previous AMR.33 machine-gun armed light tank, which had suffered from poor tracks and suspension. Despite being larger and heavier, its bigger engine and improved suspension made it faster and more manoeuvrable than its predecessor. 167 of these light tanks, many armed with 13.2 mm machine guns in a standard turret, were in service during the Battle for France in 1940. A subvariant, the ZT3, was planned to carry the French standard anti-tank gun, the 25 mm, to serve alongside the machine-gun armed AMR.35s in the French light motorized units. A total of ten ZT3 are believed to have been produced and issued prior to the fall of France.
