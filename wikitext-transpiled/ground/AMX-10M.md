== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''AMX-10M''', a unique French tank destroyer,  was developed from the [[AMX-10P]] infantry fighting vehicle. The AMX-10M was part of the {{Annotation|ACRA|Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé; Self-Propelled Rapid Anti-Tank}} project that started in the 1960s, which aimed to create a vehicle capable of firing supersonic {{Annotation|ATGMs|anti-tank guided missiles}} from a 142 mm smoothbore gun. The AMX-10M retained the same engine, chassis, and 20 mm autocannon as the AMX-10P, but had a modified chassis that housed the ACRA launcher and its missiles. The ACRA missiles had a range of about 4 km and could penetrate up to 700 mm of armour. Ultimately, due to the large associated expenses especially with the ATGMs, funding for the program was terminated at the last stage of testing. Additionally, advances in fire control systems for contemporary armour-piercing projectiles and the ACRA missiles' lack of ability to be deployed on helicopters, as well as the increasing relevance of the HOT ATGM system also contributed to the projects' cancellation.

Introduced in  [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], the AMX-10M is a rather special tank that can fire barrel-launched ATGMs, a feature not commonly found in Western tanks or tank destroyers. The ACRA missile’s fast flight speed makes it difficult for the enemy to avoid getting hit. However, the missile requires continuous guidance and cannot hide behind cover due to its launcher and optic location, which means that the AMX-10M must be constantly exposed, increasing the risk of return fire. Despite these setbacks, the AMX-10M is still a formidable tank at range, able to easily penetrate the upper front plates of any heavy it can encounter at its battle rating, including the [[T95]], [[Maus]], [[IS-7]], and even the [[Object 279]]. It can also serve as an excellent last-ditch self-propelled anti-aircraft (SPAA) thanks to the AMX-10M possessing the same 20 mm gun as its brethren, the [[AMX-10P]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour of the AMX-10M is thick enough to protect from small calibre machine guns from all angles. The extra structural steel plates help add 4 mm of protection, allowing the AMX-10M's armour during hull-down positions to protect against 20 mm AP rounds from medium ranges and most .50 calibre rounds beginning at around 400 meters. However even when hull-down the armor won't protect the gun breach from HMGs and Auto-cannons. Overall, the armour is similar to other ATGM carriers in that it shouldn't be relied upon.

The '''AMX-10M''' is a French prototype tank destroyer based on the AMX-10P infantry fighting vehicle. It was developed in the early 1970s as part of the {{Annotation|ACRA|Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé; Self-Propelled Rapid Anti-Tank}} program, which also led to the [[AMX-30 ACRA]].

'''Development and Design'''
The AMX-10M was designed by the Atelier de Construction d’Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX) as a private venture, without any official request from the French Army. The project aimed to create a light and mobile tank destroyer that could engage enemy tanks at long ranges with guided missiles. The engine used in both the AMX-10P and the AMX-10M is the Hispano-Suiza Model 115-2 eight-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel, which generates 205 kW (280 hp) at 3,000 rpm, giving the vehicle a power-to-weight ratio of 19 hp/ton.

The AMX-10M had a crew of four: the driver, the commander, the gunner, and the loader. The driver sat in the front of the hull, while the other three crew members were located in the turret. Interestingly, the AMX-10M can also swim, like its brothers the [[AMX-10P]] and [[AMX-10RC]].

'''Offensive weapons'''
The AMX-10M used the same chassis and engine as the AMX-10P but had a modified chassis that housed a 142 mm ACRA gun launcher, capable of firing both rocket-assisted HE shells and ACRA missiles. The ACRA missile was a fin-stabilized, rocket-assisted projectile that had a shaped charge warhead and a semi-active laser guidance system. The AMX-10M carried 46 rounds of ammunition, 17 of which were ready to fire.

'''Service'''
The AMX-10M was never adopted by the French Army, as it was deemed too expensive and complex for its intended role. The ACRA missile system also faced technical difficulties and reliability issues, and was eventually cancelled in 1977. Three prototypes of the AMX-10M were built, and it was used for testing and evaluation until the late 1970’s. The vehicle is now preserved at the Musée des Blindés in Saumur, France.
