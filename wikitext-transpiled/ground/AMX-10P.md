== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is considered one of the first French IFVs. Developed after a request to replace its predecessor, the ageing AMX-VCI, the AMX-10P's first prototype was completed eleven years after the production of the AMX-VCI in 1968. The AMX-10P features a Hispano-Suiza HS-115 engine, which gives the platform 275 horsepower and allows the AMX-10P to reach speeds of up to 65 km/h. Its main armament, the [[GIAT M693/mod F2 (20 mm)|20 mm GIAT M693]] autocannon shares the same rounds as the commonly seen [[Rh202 (20 mm)|Rh202]] but features a slightly lower fire rate of 740 rounds per minute. However, this main armament was increased several times throughout its lifespan, being augmented with MILAN launchers, or in some instances being replaced with higher calibre autocannons and even high calibre cannons to create variants such as the [[AMX-10RC]] and the [[AMX-10M]]. In total, approximately 1,800 units of the AMX-10P were produced, with production ending in 1994, being replaced by the VBCI.

Introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]], the AMX-10P  provides an excellent, if not exceptional fire rate with the possibility of an APDS belt in an amphibious yet squishy APC hull only offering up to 20 mm of armour. While it should be mostly used for taking down planes, the maximum gun elevation of 50 degrees can sometimes hinder anti-air capability, and smart players can directly fly above the vehicle where it cannot retaliate. However, while not very effective at destroying tanks, the AMX-10P can be used in an ambushing role, able to tear weak opponents apart thanks to its decent APDS belt and dual feed allowing it to switch quickly between belts. Alternatively, the AMX-10P can also flank and scout for its team as an IFV, proving a valuable asset in the hands of a good player.

The '''AMX-10P''' is a French amphibious infantry fighting vehicle. Starting development in 1965, it was designed to replace the AMX-VCI, an IFV based on the AMX-13.

'''Development and Design'''

Following a request from the French Army, the ''Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux'' (AMX) finished the first prototypes around 1968. They were showcased to potential domestic and international customers at Satory in 1969. After a short delay, production finally commenced when the French Army placed its first order in late 1972. The first AMX-10Ps were delivered in mid to late 1973 to the 7th Mechanised Brigade stationed at Reims.

Featuring a distinctive, pointed hull based on a welded steel or aluminium alloy, the AMX-10P was somewhat similar in appearance to the Marder IFV, but was sizably smaller than the German IFV while also possessing amphibious capability.

The AMX-10P's transmission is composed of a hydraulic torque converter coupled to a gearbox with one reverse and four forward driving gears. The vehicle's torsion bar suspension supports five road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and idler near the rear, which can be accessed from inside the hull through maintenance panels. The engine used in the AMX-10P is the Hispano-Suiza Model 115-2 eight-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel, which generates 205 kW (275 hp) at 3,000 rpm, giving the vehicle a power-to-weight ratio of 19 hp/ton.

'''Offensive weapons'''

Originally, the AMX-10P was fitted with a GIAT M693 automatic cannon, similar to the Rh202 and able to fire both High-Explosive and French OPTSOC APDS rounds developed specifically for the gun. However, over the AMX-10P's long career, it was augmented or replaced several times, including by a M811 25 mm cannon, HOT missiles, the French ACRA missile, and even a wheeled version armed with a 105 mm cannon known as the [[AMX-10RC]].

'''Service'''

The AMX-10P was quite popular in the export market, being primarily used by poorer nations. Greece was the first foreign power to purchase the AMX-10P, who between 1974 and 1977 ordered over 100 vehicles in three separate variants. Qatar ordered 30 AMX-10Ps in 1975, while Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia accounted for large export orders during the early 1980s. The last order was taken from Singapore for AMX-10P PAC-90s in 1994, following which the production lines were closed. All in all, approximately 1800 AMX-10Ps were produced.

108 AMX-10Ps underwent extensive overhauls to improve their armour and mobility between 2006 and 2008, including new gearboxes and suspension systems. By 2015, however, the AMX-10P had been entirely withdrawn from French service, being replaced by the VBCI.
