== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''AMX-10 Roues-Canon (RC)''' is the first variant of the AMX-10 RC armoured fighting vehicle family. The AMX-10 RX, developed and built by Nexter Systems for armoured reconnaissance purposes, has been equipping French cavalry forces since 1981, with over 240 still in service with the French Army in 2021. Morocco bought 108 units, while Qatar bought 12. The vehicle is best described as a wheeled tank destroyer. It has sometimes also been referred to as a light tank, though this classification is debatable. The AMX-10 RC is armed with a medium-pressure 105 mm F2 BK MECA L/47 tank gun mounted in a three-man GIAT Industries TK 105 turret. A SAMM CH49 electrohydraulic gun control system is used in the turret. The main armament lacks a fully automatic stabilization system. The AMX-10 RC differs from the amphibious AMX-10P in that they share automotive components but serve entirely different tasks on the battlefield. The AMX-10 RC is typically utilized for reconnaissance missions in dangerous areas or to provide fire support for troops.

Introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]], the AMX-10 RC should be employed primarily as a support and sniper tank. Taking the point in the spearhead of an assault would result in getting knocked out due to its lack of armour protection. The AMX-10RC is a powerful sniping vehicle. It is one of the best long-range combat vehicles due to its access to powerful ammunition, thermal imaging equipment, laser rangefinder, and relatively high zoom gunner scope. The AMX-10RC can scout tanks from a distance, directing allies to engage enemies without disclosing your location. Due to its high top speed, strong acceleration, and powerful main armament, it is also ideal for flanking in urban and rural terrain, capable of eliminating multiple tanks before quickly retreating to cover. If required, use smoke to hide your escape route.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The AMX-10 is considered a light tank, it has minimal armour protection. Some of the areas of this tank can survive up to a 20 mm autocannon, but can't survive anything more than that. The crew members are grouped very close together, meaning that APFSDS at this battle rating will take them out with ease. Even if that doesn't destroy the tank, there are ammunition racks stored everywhere, which can be detonated by spalling.

'''Armour type:'''

* Aluminium alloy AMS 4050A (hull, turret, cupola)
* Wheel (tires)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=434|rbMinHp=248}}

The {{PAGENAME}} has decent mobility when not upgraded, faster than most tanks but not as fast as wheeled vehicles like the B1 Centauro. It is the only wheeled non wheel steering tank in game, it has a tank steering (on its own axis), making it able to have neutral steering compared to other wheeled vehicles which turn one or two pairs of wheels to turn, like the Centauro. It has a superb speed when on road (as it is a wheeled vehicle) but somewhat lacks speed when on off-road (as it is a wheeled vehicle). Using the hydropneumatic suspension can help on lowering the center of mass of the vehicle, increasing acceleration, neutral steering speed and normal steering speed (physics).

{{main|Modele F2 (105 mm)}}

The AMX-10RC has a 105 mm/47 F2 BK MECA gun, similar to the 105 mm guns found on the AMX-30s. The gun is a medium pressure gun, meaning it has a relatively high muzzle velocity. It has access to both HEATFS and APFSDS ammunition, one of the two vehicles at the battle rating with access to APFSDS and one of the two to have thermal sights, making the 10RC a competitive long range sniper. It also has access to a laser rangefinder.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 2, 3, 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 16 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These 4 racks are also emptied first when firing: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 1.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into racks 5 then 4, 3 and 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

The {{PAGENAME}} should be mainly be used as a support and sniper tank. Due to its lack of armour protection, taking the point in the spearhead of an assault would result in being knocked out. These are the three main roles it excels at:

'''Sniper:'''
The {{PAGENAME}} is one of the most capable sniping tank in the game, with its 325 mm penetrating APFSDS round. The access to APFSDS, thermal imagery, laser rangefinder and relatively high-zoom sights, make it one of the best long range engagement tanks, even exceeding other sniper vehicles such as the [[Centauro]] and the [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard]]. The {{PAGENAME}} has scouting ability, being able to mark tanks at distance so allies can take a shot without you exposing your position.

'''Scout:'''
The {{PAGENAME}} has scouting capabilities which can mark enemies at all ranges for allies. When concealed and scouting, only open fire at an enemy when there is a risk of them being able to knock you out. Otherwise, let your team take the enemies you have scouted to stay hidden.
[[File:Y axis inclination.png|thumb|right|300px|AMX-10RC Y axis inclination to the right]]

'''Flanking:'''
The high speed, acceleration, and powerful gun  makes it perfect for flanking when in urban and rural maps, capable of destroying tanks in one or two shots before they react to the threat. Always do "Hit N' Run" when flanking. Strike, cripple or destroy, scout crippled tanks, leave. Use smoke if needed to cover your escape. Reverse will not be an issue as it has the same number of gears it uses to go forwards but backwards, making it capable of reaching ~40 km/h backwards if needed.

'''''The little trick the {{PAGENAME}} has:'''''
Hydro-pneumatic suspension. This feature gives the light tank superb terrain adaptation, making it capable of firing from terrain elevation greater than 10° (the depression of the main gun). Leaning the vehicle forward adds almost 30° of depression, allowing it to poke and fire from the most abnormal positions a normal tank would use. The {{PAGENAME}} has a 3 axis hydro-pneumatic suspension, meaning it can lean forward and backwards (x axis), left and right (y axis), or raise and lower suspension (z axis). Decreasing ground clearance improves the vehicle's mobility (as center of mass is closer to the ground), improving acceleration, speed, neutral steering speed, moving steering and also reduces vehicle's profile.

Y axis inclination can not be used to poke over corners, it can be used to "normalize" the inclination when the vehicle is sideways on a cliff (see picture for reference).

[[File:10RC on water.png|thumb|right|300px|AMX-10RC in water. As you can see, it has a really small profile when in water]]
Its incredible agility and mobility makes the {{PAGENAME}} capable of moving side to side of a map faster than most of the vehicles at its BR. Its thermal signature is relatively low compared to other vehicles at its br, making it less visible to vehicles with thermal imaging devices like the [[Centauro]], [[Type 89]], [[M3 Bradley]], [[BMP-2]], etc. The {{PAGENAME}} has amphibious capabilities but the lack of gun stabilizer makes firing on the water nearly impossible. Use this capability to reach places on the map where people do not tend to go/scout (such as the island crossing the river in Kursk), hide from enemies (under Eastern Europe river bridges for example) or any map that this can be exploited, do not be afraid of water. It is slow in water (only reaches 7 km/h) but can be a decisive capability if the commander is patient.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 105 mm gun is on par with the medium tanks of its rank
* Available with a decent HEAT and is the first vehicle to unlock APFSDS rounds together with the [[T95E1]]
* Good top speed similar to one of a light tank, great for scouting the enemy team
* Access to thermal optics at a lower battle rating than most nations, great for spotting concealed enemies
* Immune to heavy machine guns to the front and beyond 100 m to the sides
* Access to the scouting ability, great for a support role
* Hydropneumatic suspension, helps manage those ridgelines to expose as little of the vehicle as possible

'''Cons:'''

* Thin armour much as with most armoured cars, very vulnerable to SPAAGs, aircraft, tanks with autocannons and chemical shells. CE shells do a lotta damage because of overpressure mechanic.
* Gun is not stabilized, it will take a long time for the gun to settle to make a sniper shot
* Even though the vehicle is amphibious, it isn't recommended for one to engage while being in water as waves can have a massive impact on ones accuracy as the gun is not stabilized
* Very vulnerable in a city or other close quarters maps, as well as when caught in the open while moving
* Lack of any heavier machine gun than 7.62 mm; if using APFSDS primarily, that means it will often struggle when facing lightly armoured targets
* Poor acceleration and offroad capabilities; it will very rarely if at all reach its top speed in realistic and simulator battles

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

'''<big>Development</big>'''

The AMX-10RC was an armoured car which began development in the 1970's to replace the Panhard E.B.R. which had entered production almost 20 years earlier in 1951. The AMX-10RC project was developed at Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX) starting in September 1970.

'''<big>Production and Service</big>'''

The first AMX-10RC prototypes began testing by 1976 and production began in 1977.  A total of 457 AMX-10RC armoured cars would be built.

The AMX-10RC entered service with the French Army in 1979. The first operational use of French AMX-10RCs was during Operation Manta from 1983 to 1984. This was the French operation to defend Chad against incursions from Libyan forces and Chadian rebels during the Chadian-Libyan Conflict.

The most well known use of the AMX-10RC was during the 1990-1991 Gulf War. Before the invasion of Iraq began the French AMX-10RCs were upgraded. The upgrade consisted of reinforced frontal armour, an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) decoy system, as was a DIVT-16 thermal sight for the gunner. The French 6th Light Division contained 96 AMX-10RC armoured cars, and that division was responsible for protecting the western flank of the invasion force. During the campaign, the 6th Light Division defeated the Iraqi 45th Infantry Division in a battle that resulted in 3,000 Iraqis captured, 20 tanks destroyed, 2 tanks captured; the French suffered no casualties or losses during that action, named Operation Daguet. The division also captured the As-Salman airfield.

The French AMX-10RCs participated in other operations after the Gulf War, including during UN operations in Kosovo during the late 1990's.

French AMX-10RCs were upgraded to the AMX-10RCR (Renové; renovated) standard. in 2000.

In 2006, French AMX-10RCRs were used alongside the French Foreign Legion in UN peacekeeping operations in the Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). AMX-10RCRs were also used in the Suroba and Kapisa regions of Afghanistan; at least one AMX-10RCR has been hit by an IED at some point in Afghanistan. AMX-10RCRs were used in the 2013-2014 Operation Serval, the French intervention against Islamic forces in Mali.

The AMX-10RC also entered service with the nation of Morocco (108 procured) and Qatar (12 procured).
