The '''AMX-13/75 FL-11''' is the first subvariant of the [[AMX-13|AMX-13/75 FL-10]], which is the first variant of the [[AMX-13 (Family)|AMX-13 light tank family]]. France had been fighting in the First Indochina War for six years by February 1952. Jean Letourneau, French Minister of State for Relations with Associated States, requested that the most advanced light tank, the AMX-13/75 FL-10, be delivered to cavalry units fighting the Viet Minh. However, the massive FL-10 turret and its long, high-velocity 75 mm SA 50 L/57 tank gun were simply unsuitable for Vietnam. To meet such demands, it was decided that the AMX-13/75 FL-10 would need to be modified to be suited for confined environments within the jungle while also being light enough that it could be transported by air. This was accomplished by equipping the AMX-13/75 FL-10 hull with the new FL-11 turret, primarily designed for the [[E.B.R. (1951)|Panhard Engin Blindé de Reconnaissance (E.B.R.) Modèle 1951]]; it was smaller and lighter, and had a shorter gun that was more suited to the dense jungle environment, being able to more effectively use its high-explosive shell to provide infantry support. The new tank was designated AMX-13/75 FL-11. While it was a successful modification that saved 1.5 tonnes of weight, the vehicle still had to be completely disassembled to be air-transported, and the eventual end of the war meant that the tank would never enter mass-production. The initial batch of 5 units was ultimately sold to Morocco.

Introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]], the AMX-13/75 FL-11, like other light tanks, excels as a flanker and scout due to its extremely thin armour. The sloped upper glacis plate and turret front may deflect some rounds from weaker enemy tanks, but everything else will easily penetrate the AMX-13/75 FL-11 armour. Frontal assaults against the adversary should not be carried out with the AMX-13/75 FL-11. Furthermore, due to its sluggish reverse speed, it is difficult to return to cover after being detected; therefore, vigilant awareness of the surroundings is required in combat.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

This light tank actually has decent armour at its battle rating, especially in the turret front area where 40 mm sloped at ~60° will defeat some small calibre guns. However, although the turret's front armour is good, this does not mean you can just go hull down and be safe, it will only provide you a chance to survive a shot and reposition (a useful tactic to learn when playing the AMX-13). Everywhere else has only 20 mm of flat armour. The upper front plate is sloped at 66°, which may ricochet long-range shots. With only 10 mm of roof armour, stay away from low-flying aircraft as your own armament does not enable you to engage aerial threats.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof - rear, cupola roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret base, turret, gun mantlet, cupola)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=418|rbMinHp=239}}

With a power ratio of 26.97 HP/ton in AB, or 15.42 HP/ton in RB ('''stock!'''), the {{PAGENAME}} chassis offers mobility that leave almost nothing to be desired (reverse speed is kind of slow with only -6 km/h). With its wide tracks, even soft terrain is not that hard to cross. The only thing to consider while driving this light tank is obstacles as they can significantly reduce your speed, thus making you vulnerable and/or less effective. One could make very good use of such a fast and small vehicle by avoiding contact while making a large flanking manoeuvre, scouting enemies and popping out sometimes to take down enemies from unexpected angles.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|SA49 (75 mm)}}

The 75 mm SA49 cannon is quite decent at the BR. Its only flaw being a bad firing arc (shell drops fast with distance), which makes long-range engagements inadvisable. Penetration rates are comparable to those of the Russian [[F-34 (76 mm)|F-34]] cannon or those of the British [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder Mk.V (57 mm)|QF 6-pounder]]'s stock shot. While not being the best gun at the BR, it certainly provides enough firepower to destroy any enemy's flank. Horizontal drive is fast, allowing for fast reaction shots in close range engagements. As for elevation angles, -6° of depression feels a bit lacking while 13° of elevation is clearly the worst thing about this configuration: you cannot engage air targets. One last thing to consider about your main gun: it is mounted on an oscillating turret, which makes stop-and-shoot tactics ineffective. Coaxial armament is the classic French MAC 31 with 100 rounds loaded and ready to turn those soft targets to shreds. A sweet addition to this tank is 4 smoke launchers located on the lower turret part's back, these can be used either to shield you and your allies from incoming fire, to cover your retreat or to hide your team's movements from enemy sight. Smoke launchers at this low BR prepares players to higher-ranking battlefields and tactic opportunities, make sure to master them.

The small calibre of the MAC 31 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The AMX-13 (FL11), in line with most light tanks, shines best as a flanker and scout, due to its almost non-existent armour. Some shots against lower tiers can be bounced off by the sloped upper glacis plate and turret front, but anywhere else will get penetrated with ease. A sub-par gun without APHE ammunition means frontal engagements are mostly out of the question.

Scout and flank, as any other light tank should. The AMX-13 (FL11) cannot stand up to direct assaults from the enemy; it has irrelevant armour, decent speed, a useable gun with lacking depression (especially facing forward), and only 3 crew. The bad reverse speed also makes it unable to retreat behind cover once discovered, so caution in engagements is advised. It is also worth noting that the low velocity and high drop rate of its shells allow the FL11 to engage from behind slopes without having to reveal itself.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent penetration
* Fairly small and has a low profile: easy to hide, helps scouting
* Good mobility
* Has smoke launchers
* Poorly aimed shots may bounce off the 40 mm sloped turret
* Unlike most light tanks, impervious to HMG from the front
* Engine in the front protects crew in head on engagements
* Has access to the same APCBC shot with HE filler as the [[M4 Sherman (Family)|M4 Shermans]]

'''Cons:'''

* Very bad gun handling
* Long reload time
* Low velocity cannon: long-range shots are hard to land
* Unstable cannon pitch up when firing, makes it difficult to stay on target
* Unstable cannon pitch up when braking, makes it difficult and slow to acquire targets right after stopping
* Mediocre gun depression (especially facing forward)
* Bad reverse
* Bad elevation and no top-mounted MG makes it vulnerable to aircraft
* Turret area is filled with ammo
* Lamps on the hull will stop you from aiming from specific angles

{{main|AMX-13#History|l1=History of the AMX-13}}

===Development===
In 1952, the First Indochina War had been raging for six years. The French Army was facing a better and better armed enemy and their cavalry units were still equipped with WW2 tanks like the M24 or the M5A1. The French government decided to send the latest developed French tank, the AMX-13, in Indochina. However, the AMX-13 needed to undergo modifications for the South-Eastern theater. The large FL-10 autoloader turret and the long 75 mm gun made the AMX-13 unadapted for the logistical constraints of the colonial conflict (limited air transport capabilities and combat in constricted urban environments).

That's why a new turret was installed (the FL-11 equipping the Panhard EBR reconnaissance armoured car) which was smaller, lighter and sporting a shorter 75 mm gun. The new turret made the tank less tall and shorter in overall length. However, the new turret was cramped, which was detrimental to the manual reloading of the gun. No major modification was brought to the hull: the only noticeable difference was the shift from 4 track return rollers to 2.

The production started in 1954 with an order for 20 units but only 5 were produced. By that time, the First Indochina War had come to an end and the need for such an urban combat vehicle had disappeared.

===Combat usage===
The 5 {{PAGENAME}} were allocated to the 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment in Oujda, Morocco. They never saw combat action and were sold in 1956 to the Moroccan Army following the country's independence. The light tanks stayed in the Moroccan arsenal until 1973. It is unclear if they ever saw combat under Moroccan flag.
