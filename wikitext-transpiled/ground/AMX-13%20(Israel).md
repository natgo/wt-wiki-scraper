== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof, side and rear)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret base, turret front, gun mantlet, cupola)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The AMX-13 is not the fastest for the BR, mostly losing to wheeled vehicles. However, the AMX-13 keeps a consistent speed regardless of the terrain, making it able to reach off-road positions much faster. On top of that, the excellent power-to-weight ratio also helps when trying to reach elevated positions. 

The main drawback to remember is the sub-optimal reverse speed. The AMX-13 can only partially expose itself, a fully exposed AMX-13 will not be able to reverse back into cover in time.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 6* and 7* (autoloader magazines) are first stage ammo racks. They total 12 shells.
** These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.
** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
** Once the autoloader magazines have been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader with at least 1 shell.
** The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun (about 15 seconds). Take this into account when playing.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 5 into rack 7* then 6*. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
How the AMX-13 can be used largely depends on what BR and nations it is facing. At a full down-tier, against 5.3/5.7 (AB/RB), the AMX-13 can be used at medium to long range as a travelling sniper. The main threats at that BR are heavies such as the American [[T34]], the German [[Tiger II (H)]] and the Russian [[IS-2 (1944)]]. These can all be penetrated in their respective weak spots at 500 m, however the further you are, the narrower the weak spots get, and there is no guarantee to disable them in a single shot. 

In an up-tier, against up to 7.7, the AMX-13's long-range capabilities are greatly diminished. Most medium tanks become tough to deal with. Heavies like the [[IS-3]], [[T32]], [[M103]] and [[Maus]] are a no-go, [[T-54]]s are particularly tough as well, the only mediums still easy to deal with at long range are the [[Leopard 1]] and [[AMX-50]]. In this situation, the AMX-13 can still shine as a flanker, where you can use your rounds on the less-armoured sides and at a closer range. 

It is important to remember that the AMX-13's round is a 75 mm APCBC with no explosive filler to speak of. The round struggles against any form of angled armour, and the post-penetration damage is not always sufficient, even destroying light vehicles from the side may prove difficult (the [[BMP-1]] and [[Marder A1-]] being the toughest to deal with). The 5 seconds autoloader can alleviate that, but you will still need to aim strategically. When facing a medium or heavy tank frontally, the best option is sometimes to shoot the barrel and disengage (or, provided they are alone and close enough, get on their sides to finish them off). It will usually take more than one round to destroy an enemy vehicle (against large vehicles, even a direct shot to the ammo may not detonate it due to poor post-penetration damage), so disabling them with the first shot should always be your first priority. 

Particularly when getting on the side of multiple enemies at once, focus on disabling all the enemies before attempting to finish them off. A shot to the side turret to destroy their cannon breech is usually the most optimal. This is particularly true for the American [[T34]]s and [[T32]]s. As for the [[IS-3]], due to the angled turret, the easiest method is a shot to the rear turret, otherwise, a shot in between the hull and the turret is the only place that can be penetrated. On the side,  it is possible to penetrate the [[Maus]]' armour, however it is a lengthy and dangerous process, and it is usually better to simply destroy its guns and let your team finish it off.

Finally, remember to pro-actively use the scouting ability, it can often save you in a pinch. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 75 mm APCBC has high penetration and high velocity, can penetrate even heavy tanks' weak spots (e.g. [[Tiger II (H)]])
* Autoloader reloads the cannon at an impressive speed
* Fast on most terrains, can effectively perform flanking
* Small profile, easy to conceal the tank and ambush others
* Autoloader means that injured crew or fire-extinguishing will not impact the reload time which can be a life-saver

'''Cons:'''

* Poor survivability, thin armour can be penetrated by any gun including that of any SPAA like [[Falcon]]
* Narrow tracks negatively affect its start-up agility on loose surface
* Autoloader holds 12 shells, reload time significantly lengthens after those
* APCBC isn't explosive, requiring accurate shots on crew or other components
* -7 km/h reverse is very low, severely limiting its tactical agility
