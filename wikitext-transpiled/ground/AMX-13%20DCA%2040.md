== Description ==
<!--''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.''-->
The '''AMX-13 Défense Contre Avions (DCA) canon de 40 mm''' is the fourth variant of the [[AMX-13 (Family)|AMX-13 light tank family]]. Due to a scarcity of self-propelled anti-air (SPAA) vehicles in France following World War II, attempts were undertaken in the 1950s to repurpose existing tank chassis for anti-air tasks. The main weapon of the prototype is a 40 mm Mle51 T1 cannon based on the 40 mm Bofors L/70 cannon. The resulting vehicle is called the AMX-13 Défense Contre Avions (DCA) canon de 40 mm, and it is comprised of an [[AMX-13|AMX-13/75 FL10]] chassis with a rear-mounted armoured SAMM S-980 turret that allows firing at 90° elevation. With its sloped sides and full 360° traverse, the turret provided adequate overall protection.

Introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]], the AMX-13 DCA canon de 40 mm is extremely versatile, as it can effectively execute both anti-air and anti-tank duties. It possesses an autocannon with a decent firing rate and accuracy that can easily knock down enemy aircraft. This, combined with the deadly firepower it has access to, makes it an extremely dangerous vehicle. Furthermore, its mobility can be used to flank across the battlefields and engage poorly armoured vehicles in the enemy team early in the battle. Its interchangeable ammunition belts enable this vehicle to quickly convert between different types of ammunition. This vehicle is a tremendous beast in the right hands, easily capable of destroying many tanks in battle.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

This tank has 20 mm of armour, all around, barely angled but for the UFP, this won't protect it from antitank rounds nor from autocannon fire but it can certainly deflect poorly-aimed HMG bursts, but not for too long. If taking too long bursts (or if the enemy gets too close), some bullets may find their way through the two ''large holes'' in the turret front, near the gun area (there is also two smaller holes in the turret's back). In sum, this tank's armour is not to be trusted, but it will save you from stray bullets and medium to long range MG/HMG fire.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 302|rbMinHp= 239}}

French ground forces players should be used to the AMX-13 chassis as it is the basis for most French light tanks. With its turret being a little bit heavier and its engine 31 hp less powerful, this tank is slower than the usual [[AMX-13]]. It can still carry its user wherever it wants, as long as the situation does not require fast escape manoeuvres: with only -6 km/h backwards, it is difficult to quickly get out of an unwanted situation.

The gun is this vehicle's main appeal. Being twice as fast-firing as its predecessor makes it easier to get planes down, but you will still have to aim. As for engaging tanks, with up to 94 mm max penetration, you will start to struggle firing at most enemies since their frontal armour is strong enough to block incoming 40 mm rounds, though with some precision, medium tanks and even heavy tanks can fall victim to your gun. Lightly armoured tanks and SPAAs are easy targets with your 4-rounds bursts.

* Ammunition is organized in clips of 4 rounds.
* Racks are subdivided in sets of 4 clips.
* Clips disappear when all clips in the set have been shot or loaded.
* The actual layout of the racks is not as perfect as shown in the image, but the table is correct yet but it will eat a little onto the next rack.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

This SPAA is quite versatile as it can take down both tanks and planes with mitigated efficiency. It has an autocannon that does not fire fast enough to engage planes efficiently, nor does it penetrate enough to shred tanks. As it is, this SPAA is good for front-line use: providing cover for incoming ground attackers to its allies while also securing flanks from fast-movers.

Good at engaging both tanks and planes, its versatile belts allow this vehicle to switch roles in a split second. In the right hands, in a downtier, this SPAA is an absolute monster, easily capable of ace matches against tanks.

'''SPAA use:'''

It is easier to aim at targets coming towards you: stay with your team and fire when the plane is ~500 m away: an hitting round will shred it in no time. Any other SPAA tactics apply normally to this vehicle.

'''Front-line use:'''

Do not engage tanks frontally: prefer lateral engagements, to surprise your foes. If it happens that the enemy team is composed of medium/light tanks, there is a great chance that you can knock some of them out, but be sure to have an escape route as any tank noticing you counters those flanking manoeuvres. Heavy tanks at this BR are usually very hard to get trough, even from the side, engage at your own risk.

Even though your gun has SPAA - Level Penetration, It can go through pretty much any tank side that it faces. Even the Tiger II. And it's from this that the DCA 40 gets it's charm tactic:

# Take out the gun
# Take out the track
# Take out the machine gun
# Take out the tank

Knowing this, you can win battles against Panthers, Tigers (I and II), and many tanks you might find in an uptier at medium range, even when taking this tank into a higher tier than it could face.

Taking out the gun is fairly easy, your centre-mounted Bofors just needs to be aimed at the gun, and can take it out with 2 or 3 shots.

Once you've taken out the gun, go for the track or transmission. doing this will render any tank immobile for at least 20 seconds, which is more than enough.

93 mm of penetration can go through almost any tank's side armour and rear armour in the game. Except for most super-heavy tanks, your gun can shred enemy tanks from the side.

It's worth mentioning that in a downtier against axis powers, you can penetrate every vehicle you see from the front except for some German casemates. In an uptier, if you must engage a heavily-armoured tank from the front, several well-placed shots to the cannon barrel will knock it out, and enable you to flank at your leisure and feast on their side armour. A more conservative way to play is to stay a few metres behind the front-line and spot flanking tanks while also watching the skies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Good top speed and decent agility
* Equipped with an improved Bofors autocannon with faster rate of fire and penetration
* Fast turret traverse speed and good gun handling
* Can easily tear apart light vehicles frontally, and heavier vehicles from the sides
* Can destroy most aircraft with a few connected shots
* Gun is hard to overheat


'''Cons:'''

* Somewhat ineffective at engaging aircraft at longer range due to having only one cannon and lower rate of fire for an SPAA
* The entire turret is literally lined with ammo racks, resulting in very poor survivability
* Weak overall armour, can't afford taking hits
* Bad gun depression
* Struggles to reach its top speed in rough terrain

{{main|AMX-13#History|l1=History of the AMX-13}}

===Design===
The need for a SPAAG emerged in the 1950s for the French Army when the only AA vehicles left over from WW2 (M16 half-tracks mainly) became underpowered and thus obsolete. Several projects were launched using Bofors guns. Among them was the AMX-13 DCA canon de 40 mm using the hull of the AMX-13 on which was installed a specially designed SAMM S 980 turret housing the 40 mm Bofors L/70 gun. The turret offered good protection for the crew, 360° traverse and a 90° elevation angle. The Mle51 T1 gun fired 240 rounds per minute at 993 m/s.

===Development===
The development of the SAMM S 980 turret was stopped in 1957 and the Bofors gun production stopped in 1958. The experience gathered from similar single-gun SPAAG projects put the stress on numerous shortcomings when compared to twin-gun designs.

===Combat usage===
The {{PAGENAME}} never saw service or combat action in the French Army.
