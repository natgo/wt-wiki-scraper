== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]].

The AMX-13-90 is a light tank, and a good one if you keep on scouting. Its low profile and good mobility are your best allies if you want to make good use of its 90 mm HEATFS shells, especially with its autoloader. Always flank, scout as much as possible and only shoot when you're sure no one is waiting for you to come out of your hiding. Most cannons above 20 mm will penetrate and destroy this very fragile vehicle and its small crew, so do your best to avoid being shot at.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret base, Turret front)

Notes:

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Visual discrepancy concerns rack 1 (5 shells are modeled but it contains 3 shells) and rack 5 (3 shells are modeled but it contains 5 shells).
* Rack 6* and 7* (autoloader magazines) are first stage ammo racks. They total 12 shells.
* These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.
* As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
* Once the autoloader magazines have been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun (about 15 seconds). Take this into account when playing.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 5 into rack 7* then 6*. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
* The depletion order at full capacity is: 6* - 7* - 1 - 2 up to 5.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The AMX-13-90 is a light tank with good firepower. Its 90 mm cannon equipped with HEAT-FS rounds is enough to destroy any tank at its BR (still be aware of uptiers mostly because of the [[T-55AMD-1]] and [[T-55AM-1]] which have composite armour). The lack of stabilizer makes it bad for close and urban engagements, it should be used in open areas. With its fast reload you can snipe multiple enemies easily. Be aware of the bad post-penetration damage: on heavier tanks you should aim for critical components.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has HEATFS with 320 mm of penetration
* Small profile
* Great top speed
* Great acceleration
* Has a fast 5s reload time
* The engine and transmission can absorb some rounds giving you the time to fight back

'''Cons:'''

* HEATFS ammunition has poor post-penetration damage
* Lacks armour
* With the oscillating turret, the lack of stabilizer came with it
* Hights antennas ruin the stealthy approach
* Slow reverse speed

== History ==

'''Development'''

The AMX-13-90 was an up-gunned version of the French AMX-13 light tank. In 1964, a prototype for a modernized AMX-13, called the 2E, introduced a 90 mm gun and also reduced the amount of return rollers from four to three. A second prototype with the 90 mm gun was built, called the 2F, introduced a thermal sleeve and reduced the return rollers to only two.

The AMX-30 was planned in 1962 to replace the M47 and M48 Patton tanks of the French Army. As such, it was decided to modernize the AMX-13 fleet, as well as to produce new vehicles. The modernization began in 1964, and it included the 90 mm DEFA D921/F1 gun and many vehicles also received SS-11 wire-guided anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) mounted on racks above the gun base.

'''Design'''

The 2E and 2F prototypes led to the introduction of the production version, the AMX-13-90. The only significant change from the AMX-13 to the AMX-13-90 was the 90 mm F3 gun in a modified turret. The F3 was similar to the 90 mm DEFA D921/F1 gun of the AML-90, but the barrel was much longer. It therefore had a much higher muzzle velocity even though it used the same ammunition as the AML-90.

'''Service'''

The French Army received most of the original 75 mm-armed version, with about 3,000 entering service. They were assigned to the regular armoured units, which were mostly filled with M47 and M48 Patton medium tanks at the time. AMX-13 squadrons had four tanks, and were split into two sections of one infantry section and one light tank section each, along with an ammunition truck and command vehicle. These squadrons were used for screening and reconnaissance, locating enemy forces and engaging them. After the first section had engaged the enemy and was reloading, the second section engaged the enemy. The process of alternating reloading and firing between the sections allowed the tanks to hold off the enemy until medium tanks arrived.

In the 1960's, the AMX-30 entered service. AMX-13s were used during the decolonization war in Algeria (1954-1962), although they saw little combat due to the lack of opposition and the terrain. After the French AMX-13s were up-gunned with the 90 mm gun, they often saw service in foreign theaters of operation due to their relative inexpensiveness. The AMX-13s were decommissioned and put into reserve starting in 1985.

=== From [[wt:en/news/5285-vehicle-amx-13-90-new-toy-to-play-en|Devblog]]: ===
During the '50s and '60s, the AMX-13 light tank was considered to have underwhelming firepower when compared to certain other tanks fielded by other nations. To remedy this, several modernization and upgrade efforts were launched which focused primarily on improving the killing potential of the AMX-13. Some AMX-13s were equipped with different types of ATGMs, whilst others, like the AMX-13-90, received a larger calibre cannon with improved ballistic properties. In case of the AMX-13-90, the tank received, as the name already suggests, a 90 mm CN 90 F3 cannon, which boasted increased penetrating power and allowed the AMX-13 to engage targets at longer distances too.
