== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''AMX-13-US''' is the second subvariant of the [[AMX-13 (FL11)|AMX-13/75 FL-10]], which is the first variant of the [[AMX-13 (Family)|AMX-13 light tank family]]. In 1956, the French Army and the Direction des Etudes et Fabrications d'Armements were looking into cost-effective ways to modernize their fleet of aged M24 Chaffee light tanks. One approach was to combine the hull of the French [[AMX-13|AMX-13/75 FL-10]] light tank with the turret of the American [[M24|M24 Chaffee]]. While the official name of this subvariant of the AMX-13/75 FL-10 is AMX-US, it is also known by several unofficial names, including AMX-13 Chaffee, as it was known by troops, and AMX-13 Avec Tourelle Chaffee, which is often seen in some resources. There were only a few of these vehicles built. They first served in French military units tasked with policing colonies like Algeria. When they were no longer needed on the front lines, they were converted into driver-training vehicles.

Introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]], the AMX-13-US is a light tank that performs similarly to the AMX-13/75 FL-11. It does, however, have a roof-mounted 12.7 mm M2HB Browning heavy machine gun, which will come in handy in some situations against enemy aircraft and lightly armoured vehicles. Use your superior mobility to ambush choke points and crossroads and, if necessary, capture the zones. Always scout opponents for your allies and avoid engaging multiple enemies at the same time.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret base, turret roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret, gun mantlet, cupola)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=418|rbMinHp=239}}

This tank utilises an AMX-13 chassis with a 270 HP engine. At 19.4 hp/ton, the AMX-13-M24 has decent mobility, which will alllow it to get to best spots. While not one of the fastest light tanks in the game, the AMX-13 chassis, if driven correctly, will allow the player to survive long enough to see the end of battle.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|M6 (75 mm)}}

The punchy 75 mm M6 cannon may already be familiar to players due to extensive use of its variants in American tanks, including the [[M3 Lee]], [[M4 Sherman (Family)|M4 Sherman]], and [[M24 (Family)|M24 Chaffee]]. It offers the same excellent selection of shells, ranging from standard M72 AP to the infamous M61 APCBC. However, unlike its American counterparts, the AMX-13-M24 does not feature stabilisation for its gun.

{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|M1919A4 (7.62 mm)}}

With the M24 Chaffee turret comes the standard set of a roof-mounted Browning .50 cal and the coaxial .30 cal. The .50 can be used for both anti-air duty and for destroying tracks, add-on armour, side-skirts, and lightly armoured vehicles (such as open-top SPAAGs and SPGs), but the .30 is only suitable for open-top vehicles and for spotting enemy vehicles due to the lack of penetrative power.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
If a player wants to do well in this vehicle, they must understand that playing recklessly in this tank will get you killed immediately. The player's mindset has to be adjusted due to the unusual combination. As with each light tank, the player has to use all tools available, ranging from smoke grenades to optics. It is also recommended to use the roof-mounted .50 cal to aid you on the battlefield. Hug choke points, intersections, and, if needed, push the objective. In Arcade battles, take advantage of the light tank's Airstrike ability to assist in both the air and on the ground. In both Realistic and Simulator battles, spotting is your primary goal, but the player can easily set up ambushes and profit from this premium vehicle.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

[[M4A2]]/[[M4A4 (1st PTG)|A4]]: these Sherman tanks are widely used by over 3 nations that spread across both the Allied and the Axis side, so no matter which nation you play they can be quite tough to destroy in the hands of a skilled tanker. Given the rather weak penetration of your short 75 mm gun, their hull can be almost impossible to penetrate when angled, hull down or 300 m away. For a M4A4, there are 2 apparent bulges on the upper front plate, a penetration through there is a guaranteed kill most of the times. But in case the opponent covers them up or when it's an M4A2, aim for the middle parts of the gun mantlet or the turret armour unprotected by the mantlet, you can at least make them defenseless.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good mobility: high top speed, good turning and climbing ability
* Equipped with smoke launchers (14 individual smoke grenades)
* Engine in the front protects the crew in head-on engagements
* Uses the same gun as the M24 tanks: various shell types and good penetration
* Excellent gun depression allows for shooting from behind ridges
* M61 APCBC shell with explosive filler can easily knock out enemy vehicles with a single shot
* Fast turret traverse allows it to track targets easily
* Pintle-mounted .50 cal MG allows for air defense and some anti-tank ability (e.g. Marder III, Sd.Kfz.234 series, Breda 501, etc.)
* Scouting ability
* Gun stabilizer

'''Cons:'''

* Light armour overall with a prominent weak spot: the base of the turret
* Unstable cannon pitch due to tall turret layout and bouncy hull
** After firing, it is difficult to stay on target with the recoil
** After braking, Acquiring targets is slow as the hull rocks back and forth for a short while
* Tall silhouette
* Poor reverse speed
* Shells drop dramatically at long distances, making distant and moving targets hard to shoot at
* Reload time is pretty slow for a light tank
* Low ammo count can be a problem in long games or RB/SB matches but not so low that ammo rack detonations are rare

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In 1956, the French military attempted to modernise its light tank "fleet", and a few solutions were suggested. One of these was to attach an M24 turret to the newly developed AMX-13 chassis, which lead to the designation AMX-US. Soon, other nicknames were added, like "AMX-13 Chaffee" or "AMX-13 Avec Tourelle Chaffee" (French: ''AMX-13 with Chaffee turret''). A small number of these conversions were produced until the [[AMX-13 (FL11)|FL11]] turret was introduced. These tanks were sent peacekeep and protect French colonial interest, but were soon replaced with the new AMX-13 with an oscillating turret.
