The '''AMX-13/75 FL-10''' is the first variant of the [[AMX-13 (Family)|AMX-13 light tank family]]. The tank was designed in 1946 by the Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX) to meet a request for an armoured vehicle that could be air-dropped to support paratroopers. The first prototype went into service in 1948. Torsion bar suspension with five road wheels and two return rollers was used on the compact chassis; the engine is positioned on the right side of the tank, with the driver on the left. It has an unusual two-part FL-10 oscillating turret that contains the main armament and allows the entire upper turret to adjust elevation. The commander and gunner sit in the turret, which is located in the rear of the vehicle. The 75 mm SA 50 L/57 tank gun was autoloaded and fed by two six-round magazines situated in the turret bustle on either side. The crew could engage targets quickly due to the 12 rounds available in the drum magazines; however, once those rounds were expended, the vehicle commander and gunner could either manually refill them from within the turret or retreat to cover and reload shells from outside the vehicle through hatches above. It was exported to over 26 more countries. Over a hundred variants exist, including prototypes and export variants. Many of these variants, such as the self-propelled gun (SPG), self-propelled anti-aircraft (SPAA), armoured personal carrier (APC), and anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) carrier, comprise their own separate families.

Introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]], the AMX-13/75 FL-10 is a very competitive light tank that can reach strategic positions on the battlefield very quickly. Due to its low profile, it may hide behind various obstacles, preventing opponents from discovering it. The most effective way to employ this tank is to keep it in a hull-down position behind a hill on the map's border; frontal engagements with enemies are not recommended. Its autoloader and high-velocity ammunition allow it to eliminate multiple opponents in a short period of time. Since the shell lacks explosive filler, it is vital to target critical components such as the target's tank gun barrel, gun breech, or ammunition rack. The autoloader and quick turret rotation allow for quick switching between enemy targets during combat, while the smoke grenades allow for a speedy retreat if the situation becomes too perilous.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Even though this tank has unimpressive armour values, its sloped profile will protect it from autocannon fire (with some distance, even the [[Bofors L/60 (40 mm)|Bofors]] can't go through this tank). Any dedicated antitank gun/missile/contraption will go right through this tank's armour. While this may sound a bit bad "getting easily pierced" also has its advantages: some APHE rounds will not detonate upon impact, which will minimise the damage done. If you happen to get shot at, the best way to survive is by showing your right front corner towards the enemy, this way, the engine deck may catch some shells. Don't ever rely on this tank's armour, take every shot you survive as a second chance.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof, side and rear)

{{main|SA50 L/57 (75 mm)}}

Well-positioned, this gun can make your enemies cry: with the quick-firing rate it is "one-two, goodbye" for any foe caught from the sides/rear. In usual one-on-one engagements, foes usually exchange shots but, with the AMX-13, this is a lie: it can fire ''twice'' before its foe can reload, this can hurt very much. This high rate of fire makes it very efficient at long-distance sniping: it can adjust fire faster than its foes.

High gun placement and good gun depression angles make this tank very efficient at keeping low behind hills while showing very little of itself. Said shortly, this tank's armament is amazing.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 6* and 7* (autoloader magazines) are first stage ammo racks. They total 12 shells.
** These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.
** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
** Once the autoloader magazines have been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader with at least 1 shell.
** The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun (about 15 seconds). Take this into account when playing.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 5 into rack 7* then 6*. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

The small calibre of the MAC 31 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The AMX-13 is a very competitive tank as it can reach tricky positions quite fast on the battlefield. Its low profile allows it to hide behind many obstacles, serving as armour for this light vehicle. Keeping hull-down, behind a hill on the border of the map is the best way to use this tank: frontal engagements are a no-go with such little armour. AMX-13 commanders will be surprised to be able to shoot ''1 round every 5 seconds'' with such accuracy and power at this BR.

;Long range sniper/flanker:

* Stay low and scout targets for your team. When spotting a vulnerable enemy, shoot its engine/transmission/driver, '''don't get back into cover''' and finish it off 5 seconds later, only then, fade back into the shadows. Do not get out of cover too often as enemies too much aware of your position may destroy you easily. If spotted, stay ''as far as possible'' from enemy fire: this tank's small size can avoid a lot of shots since it takes some serious gunnery skills to hit such a fast ''and'' small target from a distance (1000+ m).

;Brawler:

* Even though this is not recommended usage, this can tank actually be taken in close-quarter combat. In this role, it behaves much like any SPAA in the same context: flanking and surprising its foes from the sides with a hailstorm of bullets. Use smoke launchers in order to secure roads and advance concealed towards unsuspecting foes.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Low profile
* Engine on the front will often absorb all damage on the front right side
* Very sloped armour on the front with decent thickness
* Frontally resistant to some SPAA fire ([[Ostwind]] and [[M19]])
* Has smoke launchers (high arc of fire)
* Can reach its top speed quite fast
* Gun performance is comparable to the British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder (76 mm)|QF 17-pounder]]'s
* Fast turret rotation
* Stock shell is quite good, although the upgraded shell is a strict improvement
* Short reload time thanks to the 12-round autoloader: 1 shot every 5 seconds, comparable to reload times at low ranks
* Has scouting ability

'''Cons:'''

* Thin top armour: vulnerable to strafing planes (can be penetrated by .50 cals with ground target belts at typical strafing ranges)
* Thin sides easily penetrated by SPAAs and HMGs
* Only 3 crew members
* Extremely bouncy suspension: bad at stop-and-shoot due to oscillating turret design
* Bad reverse speed for a light tank
* Bug-like antennas are extremely tall and give away your position when hiding
* Gun penetration subpar in up-tiers: relies heavily on flanking manoeuvres
* Restocking the autoloader is very slow once it has been depleted and it limits severely your combat performance
* Lacks defensive armament against aircraft

'''Development'''

Development of the AMX-13 began in 1946 in response to a requirement by the French Army for a light tank to support paratroopers. It was designed at Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX). A long line of prototypes lead to the production model. The first prototype was the AMX-13 2A in 1948, with four road wheels. Next came the 2B with five road wheels and a raised idler wheel, and the 2C with the FL-10 turret and two return rollers. The 2D introduced an arrangement with four return rollers.

'''Design'''

The turret held the commander and gunner, and was set to the rear of the vehicle. The hull was very compact and low profile, with the engine on the right side and the driver in the front, left side.

The main feature of the AMX-13 was the FL-10 oscillating turret, armed with a 75 mm gun with an automatic loader system fed by two six-round magazines, for a total of 12 rounds in the autoloading mechanism. The gun could depress 8° and elevate 12°, with 5° per second of elevation speed. The turret could rotate 360° with 30° per second of traverse speed. A TCV 107 laser rangefinder was provided to the gunner. 6 smoke grenade launchers were fitted on the turret, with 6 more grenades stored in the vehicle. One coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun was fitted, with 1,800 rounds in belts of 200. Another 7.62 mm machine gun could be fitted on an anti-aircraft mount with 1,800 rounds.

The gasoline engine produced 250 horsepower, and the manual transmission had five forward and one reverse gear. The suspension was of the torsion bar type. The drive sprockets were in the front, return rollers in the back, and there were five road wheels and four return rollers. The AMX-13 could reach a speed of 60 km/h, and it had a range of 400 kilometers.

The protection of the AMX-13, it being a light tank, was not great. It could withstand heavy machine gun and low-calibre autocannon rounds from the front, but the sides could not even withstand heavy machine gun fire. An appliqué armour package was developed to increase protection at the choice of the user.

'''Production'''

Production began in 1952, at Atelier de Construction Roanne (ARE). Over 7,000 AMX-13s of all variants were produced, seeing export to a number of nations as well as seeing service with the French Army. Production shifted to Creusot-Loire at Chalon-sur-Saône in 1964, since ARE began producing the AMX-30 in that year.

'''Service'''

The French Army received most of the original 75 mm-armed version, with about 3,000 entering service. They were assigned to the regular armoured units, which were mostly filled with M47 and M48 Patton medium tanks at the time. AMX-13 squadrons had four tanks, and were split into two sections of one infantry section and one light tank section each, along with an ammunition truck and command vehicle. These squadrons were used for screening and reconnaissance, locating enemy forces and engaging them. After the first section had engaged the enemy and was reloading, the second section engaged the enemy. The process of alternating reloading and firing between the sections allowed the tanks to hold off the enemy until medium tanks arrived.

In the 1960's, the AMX-30 entered service. AMX-13s were used during the decolonization war in Algeria (1954-1962), although they saw little combat due to the lack of opposition and the terrain. After the French AMX-13s were up-gunned with the 90 mm gun, they often saw service in foreign theatres of operation due to their relative inexpensiveness. The AMX-13s were decommissioned and put into reserve starting in 1985.
