== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]].

The [[AMX-30]] was first issued in August 1966, with the first 5 units being assigned to 501''e Régiment de Chars de Combat'' (Combat Tank Regiment). The AMX-30 is the first tank to use France's very own 105 mm gun, the [[CN-105-F1 (105 mm)|CN-105-F1]] designed in tandem with the Obus G spin stabilized High Explosive Anti-Tank round; a [[Browning M2HB (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm M2HB]] heavy machine gun for a co-axial, and a [[AAN-F1 (7.62 mm)|7.62 mm]] machine gun on the cupola. At the time, it weighed a light 36 tons (metric) compared to the [[Leopard I|Leopard's]] 40 tons, but overall has a lower hp/ton ratio due to the usage of a weaker engine. The AMX-30 mod. 1972 saw the replacement of the [[Browning M2HB (12.7 mm)|M2HB]] co-axial machine gun with a [[20F2 (20 mm)|20 mm 20F2 autocannon]] with the ability to elevate from -8° to 40° (20° higher than the main gun) in order to target light armoured Vehicles and helicopters

As previously mentioned, the 105 mm gun on the AMX-30 is France's own, and designed with a particular shell in mind, the OCC 105 "Obus G". This shell works by having the HEAT warhead mounted on bearings to an outer shell by bearings, thus keeping the accuracy of a normal rotating HEAT shell with the penetrative power of non-rotating HEAT Fin Stabilized shell, supposedly making the shot more accurate at longer ranges. This shell and the revision from a .50 cal to a 20 mm autocannon suggest this tank was modernized for long-range combat in a highly mobile package which could be a reflection of the French's army exceptions, possibly that fighting over the fields of France.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Being a derivative of the Euro-panzer project (like the Leopard) and that mobility and firepower were placed above almost all else, the AMX-30 was not built to get shot at by main battle tanks, or tanks for that matter.

;Hull

The lower front plate is 79 mm thick at 39° (which is not a lot at 7.3) while the upper front plate is (again) 79mm, this time at 68°. In other words, the hull will not defend the AMX-30 against anything heavier than an autocannon, although it could bounce some AP and APHE rounds when using the 8° of gun depression to its fullest, though to be safer, don't expose the front of the hull.

The sides and the rear of the hull are also lacklustre, with 30 mm protection and then the only "strong point" being the sponsons with 35 mm, expect most rounds larger than heavy machine guns to pass through. The sponsons themselves have only a 57 mm plate covering the front, not to mention it is angled up and to the side, it could potentially be a weak spot for anti-aircraft vehicles if they are at an angle compared to you.

;Turret

Much like the Hull, the turret isn't really meant to protect against much. The turret is 80 mm thick around the gun (not counting the 150 mm gun ring since it's too small a target). The rest are mostly 60 mm thick apart from a 50 mm autocannon mantlet and a 35 mm plate for the viewport. The top and bottom of the mantlet are 30 mm thick, but it's at 78°, meaning it might be the toughest part yet, particularly since shot traps from the bottom of the mantlet don't seem common.

The turret cheeks maybe only 41.5 mm thick, but from the front, the angle makes the shot risky, though be aware it is still a potential target. If the tank is played using its mobility and peeking over ridges, the cupola is 60 mm and rather big, so be wary of APHE shells because if they penetrate there, you might lose the turret crew if not the entire tank.

The most likely target on the turret (maybe even the whole tank) is the turret top and "forehead", the armour plate directly above the mantlet is 30 mm thick with an angle of 71°, it might bounce ''some'' shells, but most APDS and HEAT will still go through. The problem is that sitting at the rear of the turret is the ready rack, which will most likely detonate if hit.

The turret side armour has nothing much speaking for it that the front armour has, as much like the hull, it isn't well armoured. Ricochets and bounces off this sector are quite rare and should be unexpected. Just make sure to keep your head on a swivel and have that turret hidden or pointing at your foe.

;Modules and crew placement

A particularity in the AMX-30's survivability is the placement of modules and crew. On the Leopard, shooting the left side of the upper front plate of the hull would knock out the driver, gunner, and commander all at once, thus completely neutralizing the tank and requiring a replacement crew to be deployed, and shooting the right side would detonate the ammo rack which holds 90% of the Leopard's ammo capacity

This problem doesn't happen as much on an AMX-30 however, because of the tank's fuel tank being in front and beside the ammo rack, shots to the left side of the hull might not detonate the ammo rack there and (if you are lucky) might not even hit the gunner. As for the right side, the only crewman behind the driver is the loader.

In other words, whereas it would take one shot to disable or destroy a Leopard 1 through the hull, it may take more than one to defeat an AMX-30 this way. The downside, of course, is that you have 19 rounds of ammunition in a ready rack that will constantly fill itself, which means that 40% of your munitions is sitting behind the gunner and commander, making shots at the turret the enemy's priority

Another drawback is that AMX-30's fuel tanks are inside the hull. Stock grinding without FPE is painful, since every penetrating hit ignites the fuel.

A final note will be on the smoke shells and smoke grenades available on the AMX-30: use these without moderation! If targeted and multiple enemies are pointing/firing upon you, use the smoke grenades and relocate; if an enemy is keeping you pinned, try to catch him off guard and throw a smoke shell in his face then proceed.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,116|rbMinHp=637}}

The mobility of the {{PAGENAME}} is great in almost every respect. It has slightly lower acceleration than a Leopard or [[STB-1]], but it still gets the job done about as well. It doesn't struggle much off road, but remember that the gun is not stabilized. Firing on the move might hit occasionally and might scare them off, but shooting straight means stopping, something you should '''never''' do when targeted by enemy tanks.

Keep also in mind that the tank as -8° elevation to the front of the tank, and (like the Leopard) cannot depress over the back, so don't get flanked, ever (considering the mobility of this tank, if you're outflanked you either stayed still too long, took the unfortunate path, or didn't pay enough attention).

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|CN-105-F1 (105 mm)}}

The main armament on the AMX-30 (1972) is the [[CN-105-F1 (105 mm)|CN-105-F1]]. This gun was specifically designed for the use of the tank's OCC-105 spin stabilized HEAT shell, which works by spinning an outer shell using the gun's rifling in order to provide aerodynamic stability while the inner shell (the actual warhead) is suspended by bearings in order to minimize rotation, which would reduce the penetrative power of said shell. It is for all intents and purposes a slightly different HEAT-FS shell.

The main concern is that HEAT shells, particularly modern ones, are sensitive to impact, they might fly through some foliage and some fences, but it is best to destroy the destructible terrain first before firing (where the 20 mm comes in handy, more on that later), though you must remember that on maps like [[Sinai|Sinai]] where houses can be shot through without being shot down, you are at a disadvantage because if you are seen, enemies with AP shells of any sort can and will be able to shoot through the building and hit you, while chemical shells (including HE, HEAT, and HEAT-FS) can't.

But do not underestimate the power of its HEAT shell, it still is quite deadly, harder to bounce, and it keeps penetration over a range, not to mention you get similar performance to a Leopard's HEAT-FS from stock and thus without the associated price. All in all, firepower-wise, the tank is not bad.

The shrapnel of the round in post-penetration damage might not be as plentiful as APHE rounds, but with a reload speed of 8.7 seconds stock, provided you aim for crew and modules, you can spit out about 7 HEAT shells penetrating anything from 200 mm at 60° to 400 mm at 90° every minute. Once fully upgraded, you go from 8.7 seconds reload for about 7 shots per minute to 6.7 seconds reload for about 9 shots a minute. It isn't the best out there, but it does fire fast.

A word of warning before talking of the gun's flexibility though, knowing your enemy's tank is crucial, but most importantly you must know and remember the location of A) the gunner, in order to prevent him from firing, and B) the ammo racks, in order to one shot the enemy, should you catch him off guard or incapacitate his gunner.

As for gun handling, it's quite exceptional. The turret rotation is okay stock at 36°/s and is fast once you get the "horizontal turret drive" module unlocked at 50°/s. The turret elevation isn't slow either, meaning that acquiring, tracking, and changing targets is relatively easy on this tank, you can even track some propeller driven aircraft (more on that later).

The elevation angles aren't too bad, though could be better considering the high roof and aforementioned "forehead" of the turret, the gun only goes 8° down when fully depressed, it is worse than tanks like the Leopard and Centurions that can depress 9° and 10° respectively, but do remember it is still better than the Vickers' 7° and the T-54's 4° of depression so don't be too afraid of peeking over small hills and ridges, just be quick to pop up and back down when necessary.

==== Ammunition ====
For ammo loadouts, it is suggested to bring 20-25 rounds of HEAT, 3-6 rounds of Smoke, and no HE rounds. That is because despite the 47 rounds capacity, in a normal game you won't fire that many HEAT rounds, thus 20 shells for the more ammo conserving folk or 25 rounds for the more trigger happy recommend. You may take more if you really need to, but you can get away with just that many if you make a stop by a capture zone to replenish.

The smoke rounds, depending on your play-style, you might not need often, but when you do, they are life-saving as they can allow you to lay a smoke screen right in front of you or your team when you're out of smoke grenades (or if you've yet to unlock them yet) and they can blind snipers allowing you and your team to move up.

The HE shells are very situational since the 20 mm is almost always a better alternative. You don't need it to hull break light vehicles since the HEAT shell already does that, the only use would be for a target that is too far to hit effectively with the 20 mm, but where a HEAT shell might be unnecessary.

Notes:

- Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
- Rack 2, 3 and 4 are first stage ammo racks. They total 19 shells.
- These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.
- The depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 3 - 4 - 1.
- Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into rack 4 then 3, then 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|3}}

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

{{main|20F2 (20 mm)|A-A-F1N (7.62 mm)}}

The secondary on the AMX-30 is not a machine gun, but an autocannon. It fires a belt with a composition of 1 High Explosive Fragmentation (HEF) round, followed by one Armour Piercing round (AP) with both of these rounds being incendiary tracer rounds (I-T). Alternating between explosive rounds that are great from helicopters, planes and exposed crew, whilst burning and tracing the round, and an armour piercing round for lightly armoured targets, whilst burning and tracing the round.

The only times where you would not be firing your 20 mm gun is either: 1) there are no targets, 2) it would give your sniping position or your flanking attack away, 3) you are too far away to hit/damage anything, 4) you are trying to cool the weapon down (yes it can overheat) 5) you're reloading/un-jamming it.

In almost every other circumstance, firing the 20 mm is preferably though some times more than others, because this secondary is useful at four things in particular :

# destroying fences, walls, trees, bushes, ... and any other destructible environment your HEAT shell would detonate upon before reaching your target

# destroying light vehicles, exposed crew and even other tanks should you have the side or rear of the target to shoot at

# shooting down planes, as they are preparing or exiting an attack run

# and lastly, destroying the exposed modules (canons, guns, tracks, ERA blocks) of any tank if you can't destroy it outright

There is only one belt to use, so make use of the HE-AP combination in the belt. The autocannon gets one thousand rounds to use, which means 500 rounds of crew-injuring HE and 500 rounds of tank damaging AP, with a fire rate not too slow nor too fast that allows for sustained suppressive fire.

Considering the fact that the 20 mm co-axial is not only powerful enough but flexible enough to shoot down planes with, the A-A-F1N machine gun just seems like an outlier in terms of providing firepower. It could be useful to attack exposed crew members, but this is very rare with the type of enemy vehicles seen in matches. The best use of this machine gun would probably to annoy the enemy, or draw their attention without using the valuable 20 mm autocannon shells.

'''Pros:'''

- Tank is relatively fast and mobile
- Turret rotation and elevation is fast
- 20 mm autocannon is good against light tanks, planes, and obstacles
- HEAT shells have good penetration
- Has access to smoke shells and smoke grenades
- Gunner and driver are not aligned means tank is harder to disable in one shot
- Hull ammo rack surrounded by a fuel tank
- Has a good rangefinder as a modification, making long-range engagements easier

'''Cons:'''

- Armour is unsatisfactory against enemy armaments
- Only 8° of gun depression
- Cannot depress the gun over the engine deck
- HEAT shell can't go through obstacles
- Ready-rack at turret rear is prone to getting shot, even from the front
- High cupola design makes it easier to spot

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
