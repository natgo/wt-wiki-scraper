== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.93 "Shark Attack"]].

In the 1960s, a proposal was made to mount a 142 mm gun system firing the ACRA (Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé), English: Anti-Tank Rapid Self-guided Missile. A single prototype was finished in 1967 with a unique cast turret built around the gun, but due to the unreasonably high cost of the missiles, the project was scrapped. However, in War Thunder, it is a formidable tank to play with play styles similar to the [[M60A2]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour (front glacis, turret, cupola)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull sides, rear & roof)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,085|rbMinHp=619}}

The gun is mounted on the well-proven AMX-30 chassis, providing adequate mobility slightly slower than the Leopard 1.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

The AMX-30 ACRA mount as we saw before a 142mm laser guided gun, capable of launching ACRA missile and High Explosive round. It can carry 36 rounds, 16 in the turret and 20 in the hull, next to the driver, so you have the possibility to get a higher survivability from hull shots by removing these 20 rounds. The gun reload is 15.6 seconds with a level 1 crew and can be upgraded to 12 seconds with a max crew.

The ACRA missile is pretty fast, making the tank very useful on large maps and sits at a battle rating where nothing will be able to resist the missile. Be careful when shooting at the sides of enemy tanks, the missiles function like a HEAT round and tends to be absorbed by the tracks if hit directly. Also like a HEAT round, don't try to shoot missiles through walls, fences, big bushes, or trees.

Another good point with the gun is that you don't need to stop the tank to fire. However, the missile is guided with a laser mounted with the gun, which is not stabilized. This means your missiles will bounce up and down as you guide them if you are moving. This also means you cannot fire over obstacles like you can with wire guided missiles, as the laser needs constant line-of-sight to the back of the missile.

The M2HB coaxial heavy machine gun is a good anti-aircraft asset, it will shred any low-flying aircraft thanks to the extra 20 degrees of elevation.
The only drawback is that the MG is coaxial, meaning the turret must rotate to track the targets. The .50 cal can also deal with armoured cars and SPAA vehicles when they're up close.

The small calibre of the A-A-F1N machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good mobility
* Fast flight speed of the ACRA ATGM, it is next to impossible to dodge it for an opponent
* Can fire ATGMs on the move
* ATGM has high penetration for the BR

'''Cons:'''

* Does not have heavy frontal armour nor adequate side hull armour, so most medium tanks will penetrate it in single shot and it will not scare away light tanks
* Gun scope is not stabilized, the ATGM's flight can be effected by the vehicles movement
* Tank has to keep itself exposed while guiding the ATGM, giving the enemy a larger window to return fire
* High speed of the ACRA ATGM can make corrections at mid-range difficult
* Reload is around twice as long as most tanks of this battle rating, so it is recommended to retreat into cover for the duration of your reload after firing

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

[[File:AMX30ACRA.jpg|thumb|450x450px|The sole AMX-30 ACRA prototype.]]

The AMX-30 ACRA was a prototype modification of the AMX-30 main battle tank developed in the late 1960s for the French army. Similar to the American M551 Sheridan, the prototypes were fitted with a 142 mm cannon to fire the prototype missile "Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé" (Self-Propelled Rapid Anti-Tank Missile), or ACRA in short.  The vehicle was also fitted with an enlarged turret capable of fitting larger-calibre cannons of 120 mm. The prototypes were cancelled in 1972 due to rising development costs for the ACRA missile, which was later replaced by the HOT ATGM.

The AMX-30 was a highly successful French main battle tank (MBT) of the 1960s and 1970s with over 3,000 vehicles built in total. The AMX-30 family served as the main French MBT until the introduction of the Leclerc MBT in the 1990s; as well, a myriad of variants were created including anti-tank and anti-aircraft versions (such as the AMX-30R Roland missile battery). One of the most unique anti-tank variants was the AMX-30 ACRA, centred around the ACRA ATGM.

The ACRA, or Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé (Self-Propelled Rapid Anti-Tank Missile) was a prototype French anti-tank missile system designed to destroy enemy tanks. The missile was fired from a 142 mm smoothbore gun and accelerated to a speed of over 2520 km/h during flight. The weapon could be fitted with a 2 kg shaped charge warhead or a similar high-explosive warhead for use against personnel.

An AMX-30 was specially modified with an enlarged turret to fire the ACRA missile, along with a 142 mm smoothbore cannon that could also fire HE ammunition. The vehicle's enlarged turret could've also accommodated larger cannons such as a 120 mm cannon. Despite this, the weapon system had key limitations - primarily, the cost of the ACRA missile had skyrocketed to over 1 million francs per shot. As well, the missile could not be fired from helicopters, further limiting its effectiveness in battle. As a result, the ACRA missile system was cancelled in 1972, marking the demise of the AMX-30 ACRA. The role of the ACRA missile system would be fulfilled by the HOT, a more versatile ATGM fired from both ground vehicles and helicopters.
