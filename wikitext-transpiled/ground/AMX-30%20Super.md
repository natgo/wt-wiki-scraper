== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

'''Notes:''' <!-- Any additional notes which the user needs to be aware of -->
<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

The armour protection, as common in many European MBTs such as the [[Leopard I]], isn't enough to stop anything apart from heavy machine guns and 30 mm shells (although the sides and the rear are vulnerable even to 20 mm autocannon such as those on the [[AMX-30]] and [[MBT-70]]), but sometimes the angles of the hull will bounce some shells. The turret is not great as most shells will penetrate it, often killing the gunner and detonating the ammunition in the rear of the turret. Unlike the Leopard I, the {{PAGENAME}} is capable of carrying enough ammunition in the turret to fight, leaving the hull relatively safe, but this comes with a price: whenever the tank is hit in the turret, there's a high chance that the ammunition will catch fire.

The fuel tank in the hull can stop some heat shells, but it's not something to rely on. Given the high mobility of the tank and the two-plane stabilizer, the vehicle gives his best when moving fast and hitting the enemy from the distance.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,317|rbMinHp=752}}

The {{PAGENAME}} is fast and nimble. Its engine gives a specific power of 1,622 hp in AB and 850 hp in RB/SB. With a power-to-ton ratio of 23.2 hp/ton in RB/SB and 44.4 hp/ton in AB, this tank can certainly traverse the terrains smoothly. Being about 36.5 tons, this tank is relatively lighter than its competitors of similar BR. This tank can go up to 72 km/h in AB and 65 km/h in RB/SB forwards and it goes up to -30 km/h in AB and -27 km/h in RB/SB reverse.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|CN-105-F1 (105 mm)}}

The main armament of the {{PAGENAME}} is the 105 mm CN-105-F1 cannon, which is very similar to the likes of the [[L7A3 (105 mm)|105 mm L7A3]].  The gun takes about 6.7 seconds to reload with an aced crew with max leadership and weapon reloading skill which is fairly standard among its competitors.  This cannon fires APFSDS, HEAT, smoke and HE. It is recommended to at most keep 23 shells in the tank when playing Realistic Battles as its ready rack can carry 22 shells and this effectively removes all of the ammunition rack in the hull behind the fuel tanks (except 4 shells around the turret ring). It is recommended to take a loadout of mostly APFSDS with a few HEAT and Smoke shells just in case.

==== Ammunition ====
The main shell, the OFL 105 F1 APFSDS, is very capable of penetrating most of what it sees with a frontal shot as it has 350 mm of penetration at 0 degrees from 500 m away. The OCC 105 F1 HEATFS may be very useful against light targets such as SPAAG or light tanks. The OFPH 105 F1 smoke shell provides extra ranged covering smoke in order to mask you or your team (possibly even blinding the enemy) in combat.

Notes:

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear from the rack after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 2 to 5 are first order ammo racks (ready racks). They total 22 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
* To go into battle with the frontal ammo rack empty, pack 23&nbsp;''(+27)'' shells.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|MG3A1 (7.62 mm)}}

The AMX-30 Super is armed with a coaxial 12.7 mm (.50 cal) inside its turret right beside the cannon and a lighter 7.62 mm (.30 cal) mounted on the roof near the commander's hatch. Although ditching the 20 mm typically found on other AMX-30s, the machine guns equipped can still deal fair damage to very lightly armoured vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great mobility
* Has stabilizer so it can shoot on the move unlike other AMX-30s
* Good armour
* Armour can sometimes bounce shots
* Good survivability due to crew placement, as such it is difficult to knock it out with a single shot
* Fuel tanks may absorb the HEATFS shells and sometimes the APFSDS shells too
* Has access to a variety of ammunition rounds

'''Cons:'''

* Commander's turret machine gun found on the French AMX-30s is replaced with MG3A1 which cannot deal very well with air targets
* The armour is still easily penetrated by other nations tank at the rank
* Most of the times, the shots that penetrate the tank will take out the engine
* Missing commander optics and commander fire control compared to other AMX-30s

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
During the second half of the 80s, a group of companies in West Germany developed an extensive program to modernize certain outdated tanks, including the French AMX-30B. A number of improvements were made to the French tank in order to enhance its firepower, increase its dynamic characteristics, and (optionally) enhance its armour to a certain extent.

The tank's firing potential was improved thanks to the installation of a MOLF fire control system with a stabilized sight and a stabilizer for the main gun. The tank's mobility was enhanced with a new 850-horsepower diesel engine, a German automatic transmission, and new torsion bars and hydraulic shock absorbers. The new tank was demonstrated to the public under the name "Super AMX-30" during testing in Saudi Arabia, but no buyers were found for the upgraded French tank, and only one Super AMX-30 was ever made.
