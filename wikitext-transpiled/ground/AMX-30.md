== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5334-shop-update-1-77-advancing-storm-packs-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.77 "Advancing Storm"]], but was discontinued from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6464-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-en|7th Anniversary sale]]. It was later re-released as a premium purchasable for Golden Eagles {{ge}} after the [[wt:en/news/6907-special-8th-anniversary-of-war-thunder-en|8th Anniversary sale]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour only reaches 190 mm at some angled parts of the front, the turret goes 100 mm at best, some rank I vehicles like the Panzer IV E could take you on frontally and easily win.

Be wary, also, of your ridiculously tall cupola, you can be destroyed even if you are behind cover just because of it.

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour (front glacis, turret, cupola)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull sides, rear & roof)

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,116|rbMinHp=637}}

The mobility, which is good but unexceptional, can be both a blessing and a curse since you will not be able to shoot accurately while on the move due to the proper lack of stabilizer.

The AMX-30 is a similar tank to its younger counterpart, the [[AMX-30 (1972)]], with the 20 mm coaxial autocannon replaced by a 12.7 mm heavy machinegun, still able to deal with lightly armoured targets such as SPAA, but doesn't deal the extra punch of an autocannon.

Like the AMX-30 (1972), it lacks a stabilizer and has incredibly weak side armour, but the excellent HEAT shell, comparable to other nations' HEATFS shells, the reasonable front armour (most tanks will still one-shot you though) and the good mobility make up for it.

The HEAT shell is comparable to other nations' HEATFS shells, and has a good penetration amount (400 mm flat), but will often bounce on angled surfaces. When the shell penetrates, it usually causes enough shrapnel to one-shot a tank. In a fight against lightly armoured vehicles, like SPAA, the HEAT round will often cause hull breaks.

Notes:

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 2, 3, 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 22 shells.
* These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.
* The depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 1.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into rack 5 then 4, 3 and 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This tank cannot stand a fight on its own, therefore, only two tactics are viable.

First (the most dangerous), you can try getting behind the enemy lines and attacking the SPAA, you will often get hull breaks thanks to the HEAT round, be wary of bushes however, they will stop your HEAT shells, you can attempt to take on enemy tanks, provided it is from the side, and you can hit the ammunition (HEAT will rarely cause fire, and the weak shrapnel makes it hard to take out entire crews).

Second, stay with your team, ideally behind another tank (do ''not'' lead the formation, it'll paint a target onto the tank), use your HEAT shells to disable tracks or take out one or two crew members and ease the task of your teammates.

Compared to the vehicles it will face, the AMX-30 ranges from Inferior to Harmless, every enemy vehicle should be regarded the same way, as major threats that will destroy it in a couple of hits at best. Aiming for the ammunition is the only way for you.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fuel tank armour surrounding frontal ammo rack, much like Cold War Russian tanks
* High velocity HEAT shell that can penetrate up to 400 mm of flat armour
* Good mobility - slightly more mobile than the German Leopard I
* Access to smoke shells you can fire with the main gun - useful for blinding sniper spots or covering advances

'''Cons:'''

* Uses a single type of chemical projectile, HEAT shells, which are stopped by any kind of terrain obstacle and by tanks using ERA kits.
* Does not have a stabilizer
* Very tall cupola
* Only 30-35 mm thick side armour
* This early version of the AMX-30 lacks the 20 mm autocannon found on the [[AMX-30 (1972)]]
* Fuel tanks everywhere in hull, front and sides, likely to cause a fire

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The AMX-30 is a main battle tank that was designed and produced by the French company Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX). Development of the tank began in the early 1960s, and it entered service with the French Army in 1966. The development of the AMX-30 began in 1960, when the French Army began to look for a replacement for its aging fleet of tanks, which included the M4 Sherman and the AMX-13. The new tank was required to have a low silhouette, be highly mobile, and be capable of engaging targets at long ranges. The design was also required to be cost-effective, as the French Army was operating on a limited budget.

The first prototype of the AMX-30 was completed in 1963, and it underwent testing throughout the year. The tank was powered by a Hispano-Suiza HS-110 diesel engine, which provided a top speed of 65 km/h on the road. The tank was armed with a 105 mm gun, which was capable of firing a variety of ammunition types, including armour-piercing, high-explosive, and smoke rounds. The AMX-30 entered production in 1965, and the first tanks were delivered to the French Army in 1966. Over the next few years, the tank was exported to several other countries, including Spain, Greece, and Saudi Arabia.

In the 1970s, the French Army began to upgrade the AMX-30 with a number of improvements, including a new engine and improved armour protection. The upgraded version of the tank, known as the AMX-30B2, entered service in 1983.

The AMX-30 saw action in several conflicts around the world, including the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and the Iraq War. The tank was generally well-regarded for its mobility and reliability, but its armour protection was criticized as inadequate in some situations.

The production of the AMX-30 continued until 1992, by which time a total of around 3,500 tanks had been produced. The tank was eventually replaced in French Army service by the Leclerc tank in the 1990s. However, some countries, such as Spain, continued to operate the AMX-30 until the early 2000s. Today, the AMX-30 is largely retired from service, although some tanks can still be found in museums and private collections around the world.
