== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]].

The vehicle follows the conventional western tank design of the mid Cold War with four crew members and a 105 mm gun. It has good armour on the UFP that can bounce some weaker shells but the sides, rear and top are very weak, making the vehicle highly vulnerable to air attacks and SPAA fire even from a distance. It has good acceleration, mobility, and firepower. Its turret resembles that of the T-54 series from the sides due to its rounded shape, so be careful in SB and check twice before firing at this tank because you may hit your ally if you do not pay enough attention. This can prove both to be an up and a downside depending on who's actually making the mistake.

This vehicle has the particularity to throw the usual 7.62 or .50 co-axial MG away for a powerful rapid firing 20 mm autocanon that can be elevated up to 40° that fires HEFI-T and HVAP-T projectiles with a penetration up to 57 mm at close range and against flat armour. This weapon is very useful to deal with light enemy tanks that are rushing you since this gun will simply wreck them, especially if they show their flanks. This gun is also very effective at taking down attacking aircraft that would be crazy enough to rush straight at you or pass you by at low altitude and low speed. At last, this gun can destroy walls, trees and every obstacles you may encounter. The AMX-30B2 also has an unmatched firepower at its BR. Its 105 mm gun fires both the OCC 105 G1 shell found on the first AMX-30, but also the dreaded and powerful OFL 105 F1 which is nothing less than the second most powerful APFSDS shell in the battle rating bracket. The AMX-30B2 is also the only medium tank that has access to thermal imaging device at this battle rating. Unlike passive IR sight that can only be used during night times, thermal imaging allows you too see within the infrared spectrum even during bright day conditions! Even though its device is a first generation one, every enemy tanks will be glaring in your sight and all you will have to do is to pick them off with your powerful gun. The thermals are a very powerful tool at this BR, giving its users a tremendous advantage. This particular configuration simply tells you all about this tank, just like in real life where it used its superior detection and acquisition devices to engage and destroy targets from afar, you should simply do the same in the game by staying back and supporting your team from afar using your laser rangefinder, thermal imaging system and your powerful APFSDS to outrange and delete enemies from a distance.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Notes:

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 2, 3 and 4 are first stage ammo racks. They total 19 shells.
* These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.
* The depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 3 - 4 - 1.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into rack 4 then 3, then 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

=== Machine guns ===

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|20F2 (20 mm)|A-A-F1N (7.62 mm)}}

The 20 mm 20F2 coaxial autocannon is not just an anti-aircraft gun: with 57 mm penetration at flat angle, it will shred anything from armoured cars and SPAA to lightly armoured medium tanks' sides. In case a vehicle cannot be penetrated, use the autocannon to disable them before using your 105 mm cannon: target the gun barrel or the tracks. The 20 mm can also deal with low-flying aircraft with the extra 20 degrees of elevation. The only drawback is that the autocannon is coaxial, meaning the turret must rotate to track the targets.

The small calibre of the A-A-F1N machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

French AMX-30B2 needs to be played more carefully than its other NATO counterparts such as the M60A1 (A0S) or the Leopard A1A1 due to the lack of a stabilizer, hence making firing on the move and/or after short stop more risky than if you were playing a T-62 in the case of a sudden frontal encounter. As a result the French AMX-30B2 is the best played as a second line support tank, a long range sniper or a flanker. You cannot expect to drive straight into battle and come out victorious in this tank.

This tank is, above everything, a sniper tank. The lack of a stabilizer will restrict your playstyle on most city or clustered maps. In these kinds of environment, you will have to play much more slowly and carefully than the other tanks because most tanks amongst other nations come with a stabilizer such as the Chieftain, the T-62 or the T-10M. Just advance slowly and try to be as much aware of your surroundings as you can be because this will prove to be a real life saver in this kind of environment. You can also simply lay ambushes to your enemy by patiently waiting for someone to come in front of your gun, destroy this enemy and quickly relocate using the tank's good mobility.

On big maps however, this tank can unleash all of its potential as the lack of a stabilizer won't be a problem on big maps, find a good location with a clear line-of-sight of commonly used routes to the capture zones and use the binoculars, thermal imaging system as well as the laser rangefinder to snipe your enemies from long distance, they simply wont be able to return fire soon or well enough before a final blow (if it's not done already) achieved through a AMX-30B2's perfectly ranged and aimed shot.

To sum it short, this tank plays very differently than other MBTS from all nations. It's not as versatile or flexible as other vehicles, but is extremely good at what it does the best due to top notch gun and ammunition as well as range-finding device.

In terms of enemies: every stabilized tank can prove extremely dangerous to you in CQC. Also due to your lack of armour, any tank you can encounter in your BR bracket can and will penetrate you frontally if they lay their gun on you. The best method is often to avoid direct combat or, if you have to do it, make sure that you will do it where you'll have the advantage also known as range.

German cannon CAS is also the bane of this tank due to its very thin roof armour. If a player decides to hop into their Me 262 A1/U4 for a payback, it'd be very wise to find a hard cover or a very dense forest in the next 30 seconds because 30 and/or 30 mm cannons loaded with AP shells will be on their way with the AMX-30B2 as a priority target.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very powerful 105 mm APFSDS.
* Thermal Imaging System for the gunner
* Fast turret traverse system.
* Big ready rack allowing a good sustained RoF of 9 shots per minute
* Coaxial 20 mm autocannon with 40° of elevation to deal with thinly armoured vehicles and CAS aircrafts.
* Good survivability when being hit in the turret front as the massive 105 breech and the 20 mm breech will absorb a lot of damages.
* Smoke shells and grenades are available.
* Average -8 degree gun depression.
* Laser rangefinder being a great help to snipe over long distances accurately.

'''Cons:'''

* No stabilizers, which restricts the play style of the vehicle.
* Inadequate hull armour against other Rank VI vehicles.
* 15-20 mm roof armour can be exploited by aerial attacks.
* high cupola that can be exploited by enemies when behind a cover.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The AMX-30B2 is the second and most noticeable version of the AMX-30. Most of the improvements found in these vehicles had first been successfully tested on the AMX-32 export MBT which found no buyers most important changes were:

* Improved firepower with the introduction of the OFL 105 F1 APFSDS
* Improved firing control system with the COTAC digital firing control system
* Improved mobility by replacing the original transmission by a semi-automatic gearbox incorporating a torque converter as well as the installation of reinforced torsion bars and shock absorbers
* Improved night fighting capabilities with the installation of a second generation light intensification device
* A new hydrostatic steering mechanism.

The first vehicles were delivered to the "Armée de terre" in 1981. In 1985, the light intensification device got replaced by a CASTOR thermal camera, the vehicle depicted in the game is therefore an AMX-30B2 as it came out of the factory in 1985. The AMX-30B2 was also meant to receive either a stabilized electro-hydraulic turret and weaponry drive unit designed by the SAMM (Société d'Application des Machines Motrices) or a stabilized commander periscopic panoramic sight interlocked with the turret drive unit through the priority controls of the commander over the turret (This system is what got used on the AMX-32 and AMX-40 to ensure a firing-on-the-move capability). Neither of these two solutions were chosen due to the cost of such systems, coupled to cuts in the defense budget. Therefore, the AMX-30B2 remained one of the rare 1980s MBT that was not able to fire on the move. Despite this, all the improvements incorporated into the design made the AMX-30B2 a formidable 2nd-generation MBT in the early '80s.

AMX-30B2 had the opportunity to fire in anger during the first Gulf War in 1991 where they outperformed Iraqis modified and modernized T-55 and T-62 as well as BMP's. However, at that point in time, even though it performed admirably well, the AMX-30B2 was simply obsolete and was about to be replaced with the AMX Leclerc and even if the latter began to rapidly replace the AMX-30B2 in every cavalry regiments, it's not until the early 2000s that the AMX-30B2 stopped being in active service and fully decommissioned. Most of them were destroyed, but some were still used until very recently by the FORAD whose the point is to simulate enemy tanks during exercises. In 2018, after more than 50 years of service, the AMX-30B2 used by the FORAD got definitely scrapped.
