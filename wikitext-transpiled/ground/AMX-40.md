== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]].

The AMX-40 represents a massive shift in the French tank tree, with the addition of a stabilizer, whereas all other vehicles, with the exception of the American vehicles (Sherman M4A1, Jumbo.) have no actual stabilizer. Many players might find themselves hesitating to fire a shot as soon as a target is seen because there is usually time to think before the gun is stabilized, but at this rank, French players might find themselves having a hard time shooting before their enemy.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The frontal armour of the AMX-40 consists mainly of a composite armour section at the front of the hull with a 35 mm thick (Rolled Homogeneous Armour) upper glacis plate and spaced turret armour. Despite the presence of both spaced and composite armour throughout the front of the vehicle, the vehicle struggles to resist the ammunition fired at it from its BR contemporaries save for the occasional bounce from the steep armour angles present on the upper glacis plate and the roof of the turret. The AMX-40 contains 4 crew members where half are seated on the left half of the vehicle and the other two are situated on the right half. This provides a moderate level of survivability since shots that connect too far left or right of the centre of the tank will likely only knock out two of the four crew, potentially granting the driver another opportunity. The vehicle's cannon breech is also quite large which grants it more survivability in its ability to absorb shrapnel. In addition to this, the AMX-40 features a blow-out panel for the rear turret ammunition, which is capable of storing up to 19 rounds. This grants the tank increased survivability, as side shots that explode the blow-out ammunition generally do not destroy the vehicle upon detonation.

Overall the armour of the AMX-40 is for the most part, sufficient at protecting it from autocannon and SPAAG fire. Besides that, drivers of the AMX-40 will quickly find that its armour is inadequate at protecting it from its contemporaries and it is suggested that drivers instead make use of the above average mobility of the vehicle to ensure a degree of survivability.

'''Armour type:'''
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola) - abbreviated as RHA
* High hardness rolled armour (front glacis - composite armour)
* NERA (front glacis - composite armour)

The 20 mm 20F2 coaxial autocannon is not just an anti-aircraft gun: with 57 mm penetration at flat angle, it will shred anything from armoured cars and SPAA to lightly armoured medium tanks' sides. In case a vehicle cannot be penetrated, use the autocannon to disable them before using your 120 mm cannon: target the gun barrel or the tracks. The 20 mm can also deal with low-flying aircraft with the extra 20 degrees of elevation. The only drawback is that the autocannon is coaxial, meaning the turret must rotate to track the targets.

The small calibre of the A-A-F1N machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

AMX-40 should be used as a better AMX-30. It should be used almost the same way since the lack of armour but high speed makes it almost the same.

'''Urban combat:'''

'''Flanking''' - The AMX-40 is one of the most mobile MBTs at its battle rating and has nice agility when traversing. Speed should be the main feature of combat, "Hit n' Run" should be used, engage to disable or destroy and escape as fast as you can, use smoke if needed.

'''Front line''' - Although not recommended due to the low armour, it can withstand some ATGMs and HEATFS as well as autocannons from IFV and SPAA. Stabilizer makes a huge upgrade to the tank as it can poke and shoot from corners without stopping at all, making engagements much more quicker than with AMX-30s. Composite armour will sometimes stop powerful rounds, do not expect to stop a round with this as it is not meant to stop high calibre APFSDS or even HEATFS. It will stop low calibre APFSDS (25 mm, 30 mm, 40 mm) at relative close ranges and anti tank grenades and rockets (PG-9).

'''Support''' - Despite being an MBT, it can also be somewhat used as an IFV due to the 20 mm autocannon which can penetrate the sides of MBTs and/or destroy modules such as tracks, barrels or set engines on fire, sometimes firing the main gun is not even needed. Be aware that Soviet and Russian MBTs will stop penetration of your 20 mm HVAP due to the side armour. When engaging them, focus on firing at tracks and barrels, use your main gun to destroy them.

The OFL 120 G1 has penetration of a 105 mm APFSDS, it is only able to penetrate [[T-72A]] frontal plate. Tanks like [[T-72B]], [[T-72B3]], [[T-80B]] and [[T-80U]] will completely stop your round. Aim for the tank's sides.

'''Rural combat:'''

'''Sniping''' - The AMX-40 has pretty decent optics and thermal sight, with addition of OFL 120 G1 APFSDS, which make the AMX-40 suitable for sniping. Use your speed to your advantage and move once you destroy a target or two to keep you safe from potential revenge attacks with CAS, use smoke grenades to cover your escape or when you have been hit.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent frontal armour
* Composite armour allows for a more balanced survivability
* Good mobility: about the same as on the AMX-30, with great forward and reverse acceleration and speed
* The GIAT 120 mm gun is a big improvement over the AMX-30's 105 mm gun
* Sports a 20 mm coaxial cannon for use against lightly armoured targets

'''Cons:'''

* Overall armour can still be penetrated by the majority of the guns at its rank
* Turret turn speed is slower than most of the top rank VI tanks, close combat can turn deadly quickly for the AMX-40

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Development of the AMX-40 began as a private venture of the French GIAT company in the early 1980s, with the aim to create a new export vehicle, in anticipation of increased demand for military equipment from middle eastern countries. GIAT engineers decided to base the new vehicle off the AMX-32, which itself was an improved export version of the successful AMX-30 main battle tank. However, compared to his predecessors, the AMX-40 was to feature vastly improved firepower, mobility and protection. As a true first in the French postwar tank development history, the AMX-40 would receive a two-plane stabilizer for its 120 mm smoothbore cannon. Although the tank's turret and cannon were mostly adopted from the AMX-32, increases in weight from new components led to the fact that the hull of the vehicle had to be redesigned from scratch.

The work on the first prototype was nearing completion in 1983 and the vehicle was first shown off at the Eurosatory exhibition in the same year. Following testing in 1984, two further prototypes were constructed, featuring a number of improvements over the first one. By now, the French Ministry of Defense had started to back the promising project and GIAT soon afterwards transferred all three prototypes for comprehensive troop assessments. A final, fourth prototype was constructed in 1985. Each prototype was unique, featuring a number of external and internal differences with the main one usually concerning powerplant options.

In the late 1980s, the vehicle's development stagnated as active development was largely replaced with an active marketing campaign, in an effort to find a potential buyer for the new vehicle. Despite France's best efforts to market the vehicle, even going as far as showing off some of the prototypes in a competition in summer of 1986 in Saudi Arabia, a buyer couldn't be found. Spain was the only country showing some interest in potentially buying the AMX-40, but in the end, nothing came out of it either. By failing to find a buyer, domestic interest in the AMX-40 also faded and eventually resulted in the project being closed in 1990. Ultimately, the four constructed prototypes of the AMX-40 can only be considered as transitional designs, bridging the gap between the old second generation French MBTs, like the AMX-30 and the upcoming modern designs, such as the Leclerc.
