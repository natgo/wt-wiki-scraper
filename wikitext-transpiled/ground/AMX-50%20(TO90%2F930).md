== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season X, "Royal Guard"]]. An extremely deadly tank in the right hands, it can turn the tide of the battle against the enemy is played well.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The armour, though not thick, is highly angled and can bounce some hastily-made shots. It will not bounce APDS or HEAT rounds, so be wary of tanks bearing guns like those. Overall, it can un-reliably bounce shots and can save you from machine guns at the very least. Do not use it to brawl, use it more like a Hellcat with better armour to flank.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Use this tank as a flanker and not a medium tank. Unlike most vehicles suited for flanking, players will be able to trust the armour of the {{PAGENAME}} more, so it is useful against smaller, autocannon-armed vehicles like the [[Wiesel 1A4]] and [[BTR-80A]].

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast vehicle.
* M82 Shot has plenty of TNT for devastating post-pen damage.
* Armour can help bounce some shots.
* Turret rotation speed is very good.


'''Cons:'''

* Useless against tanks like [[Maus]] or [[IS-4M]] most of the time due to weak penetration power.
* The long cannon will take a moment to settle while coming to a complete stop to fire.
* Stock shell has no TNT filler, but doesn't really matter since it's Premium and comes equipped with the much better M82.
* Weak turret armour.
* Pintle mounted machine gun is rifle caliber, and can only raise up 20°, leaving you defenseless against aircraft.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
