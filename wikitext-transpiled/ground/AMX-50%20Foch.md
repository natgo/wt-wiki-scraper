== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]] along with the initial French ground tree.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The AMX-50 Foch is able to withstand every single round it faces in combat except HEATFS and 105 mm APCR sub-calibre shots frontally. It is often confused with the [[CA Lorraine]] and vice-versa due to its similarities in profile, size and frontal plate. For the same reason, people may think you are fragile yet you are one of the toughest armour to crack at the battle rating. Only the front is the strong section of the tank. Roof, rear and sides are the most vulnerable places of the tank, even for 20 mm autocannons.

Regarding crew compartment, despite being not too tight but not huge either, it has a high survivability specially for the number of crew members and the huge breech of the 120 mm cannon (they will most likely destroy your breech with a side shot but it will stop most of the spalling). The ammunition is located at the rear of the crew compartment (in front of engine deck) an at the hull sides. This makes the Foch one of the easiest tanks to ammo rack at the battle rating. The tank has a crew amount of 5 crewmen: driver, gunner, commander and two loaders, one of them is the machine gunner

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and tracks are both 20 mm thick.
* Road wheels are interleaved and provide cumulative protection for the lower side hull.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,420|rbMinHp=884}}

The AMX-50 Foch is not as fast as compared with other turretless tank destroyers as the [[JPz 4-5]] but not as slow as the [[Jagdtiger]]. Despite being huge, it is absurdly fast and agile for a tank its size due to being mounted on an AMX-50 chassis but with stronger armour than the Jagdtiger. As the rest of the French tanks, it has excellent neutral steering but the reverse speed is horrible. It is compensated with a tremendous horsepower and armour as well as a potent main gun. It should not be played as fast as the JPz 4-5 as well as risky but it should not be fully played as bastion defence.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|SA46 (120 mm)}}

The AMX-50 Foch can be considered as a hybrid between the [[CA Lorraine]] and the [[AMX-50 Surbaisse]]: it shares the height of the Lorraine but mobility and the firepower of the AMX-50 Surbaisse. The gun has a use and ballistic similar to the Surbaisse (both share the same ammunition).

==== Ammunition ====
''APBC:'' This is the first and only anti-tank ammunition the AMX-50 Foch. Despite having a "low" penetration (compared to other rounds seen at the battle rating) it should not be underestimated. It has the penetration to deal with all heavy tanks frontally (with exception of Maus and E-100) as well as enough spalling to destroy lightly armoured vehicles. This round is a 90% confirmed knock-out with a single shot due to its tremendous mass.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG 151 (15 mm)}}

The MG151 can be considered as one of the most reliable HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) in game due to multiple factors: ammunition capacity, muzzle velocity and penetration, stopping power and rate of fire. It is a Jack-of-all-trades when it comes to ground battles, it has a faster muzzle velocity than 20 mm cannons but has more destructive power than the 14.5 mm (Russian HMG calibre) machine gun but it overheats really fast. The MG151 is almost exclusive to this specific tank and is able of doing multiple things:

* Immediate ground defence: this machine gun is able to damage and destroyed external components of all tanks (tracks, gun barrels, etc), destroy lightly armoured vehicles (with armour thinner than 45 mm), obstruction removal (fences, walls, etc) and spotting.
* Immediate air defence: due to being roof mounted inside a cupola with a 360° rotation and a 20° elevation, it is able to critically damage low-flying aircraft. This belt has AP-I round which can cause fatal damage on all low flying aircraft (it often lights them on fire or damages their engine).

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The AMX-50 Foch does well in concealment, and so the first thing to do upon spawning onto the battlefield is to find a place where the {{PAGENAME}} can hide while having a good arc of fire against incoming enemies. Do this to minimise the weak points of the vehicle, such as the weak side armour and the long reload time. If the enemy sees only the front armour, it should be fine given the thick, sloped armour available, but do take note on the type of enemy encountered.

If a Leopard I tank or anything else with HEAT shells notice the {{PAGENAME}}'s position, immediately move as these vehicles can very easily penetrate the {{PAGENAME}}'s frontal armour. However, encountering tanks with only standard AP shells like a Tiger II should suffice as they would have a harder time penetrating through the front of the {{PAGENAME}}.

Being patient is key to the success of the {{PAGENAME}}. Going out and hunting enemies, especially in close-range fights, is not beneficial to a long-term survival strategy in the {{PAGENAME}}, especially with the weak side armour.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great armour on the front slope plate (upper glacis)
* Good mobility
* Reasonably fast
* Very powerful 120 mm gun
* Immense spalling from the APBC shells; knock-outs with a single shot are very likely
* Rangefinder logs range very quickly
* Has a 15 mm MG 151 on the top in its own turret

'''Cons:'''

* Very thin side armour
* No turret: vulnerable to getting flanked
* Rangefinder and gun mantlet are weak spots, allowing APHE shells to destroy the Foch with a well-placed shot
* The main gun has a very narrow firing arc
* Longer reload time than the AMX-50 Surbaissé
* Limited ammo choices
* AP shells will have a hard time destroying some opponents from the side
* Very low levels of zoom
* Takes time to aim, especially when stock
* MG 151 jams quickly, turns slowly and has a very limited firing arc and elevation

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

During the early 1950s, DEFA worked to produce the third version of the AMX-50 heavy tank which featured a 120 mm self-propelled gun, however, during upgrades weight became a factor severely hampering the speed of the vehicle. 1955 saw a team of seventy German engineers brought in to help solve the problem maintaining the 120 mm cannon plus have the necessary armour and maintain a 65 km/h speed. Due to the delays and problems encountered during construction, only five prototypes were constructed and only one was finished which became known as the Canon Automoteur AMX-50 Foch, named after the supreme allied commander during World War I, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, general and military theorist. The main purpose of the AMX-50 "120 mm" was to provide long-range support for the medium AMX-50 "100 mm" tanks. An ambitious task of designing a version with a 155 mm cannon was started, however, this never made it past the drawing stage.
