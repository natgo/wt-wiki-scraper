The armament present on '''AS 42 47/32''', in other words the 47mm cannon ([[47/32 mod.39 (47 mm)|47/32]]) that you can also find on [[M13/40 (Family)|M13/40s]], [[M14/41|M14/41s]] is a cannon with mediocre penetration, the shots present for research are really similar and only the penetration changes.

The excellent reloading of the cannon allows the vehicle to fire quickly, in particular AS 42 at its BR can encounter lightly armoured targets and this makes it capable of destroying ground targets easily, meanwhile if we talk about destroying air targets, it would be better to use its AA version armed with a 20mm cannon  ([[AS 42]]).

'''Notes''':

* As they are modeled by sets of 3, shells disappear from the rack only after you've fired all shells in the set.
* To go into battle with the right side empty, load 157&nbsp;''(+155)'' shells.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The AS 42/47 should be mainly used for flanking. It has the speed to reach flanking positions before the enemy does. The gun, while not impressive, has enough penetration and explosive filler to knock out most tanks that it can meet, especially when you hit them from the side. However, the penetration is still not very good, and as such the AS 42/47 suffers when uptiered with the B1 and SU-122 being your worst nightmares as even the sides of them are nearly immune to your gun. Armour-wise, it practically doesn't have any as the crew is completely exposed, making every near exploding artillery shell, machine gun of any size, aircraft strafing, or HE shell a serious threat. That's why you shouldn't drive to choke and capture points with a lot of artillery shelling. Use your speed to change position constantly and don't shoot multiple times from the same position as that could attract an artillery strike from the enemy and with that a free ticket back to the respawn screen.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast on paved roads, quick to reposition
* High reverse speed (-22 km/h) allows it to pull out of danger safely
* Very small profile, easier to conceal
* 47 mm cannon has enough penetration and explosives to frontally penetrate & knock out most opponents
* -8° gun depression plus low gun mount makes hilly terrain combat effective
* Huge ammo capacity of 300+ rounds allows prolonged battle

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely low survivability, anything can destroy it easily (MG bullets, shrapnels, overpressure)
* Wheeled design becomes sluggish off-road
* 5-second reload is not very fast for its calibre
* Cannon cannot rotate to the rear which may be dangerous in some situations

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The AS (Autosahariana) 42 was derived from the AB 41 armoured car. It was, however, unarmoured and did not have the rear driver position. Designed for long-range reconnaissance in North Africa, it had a cross country range of almost 500 miles (800 km). It was also known as the Camionetta Desertica (Desert Weapons Carrier) mod. 42, or "la Sahariana" (the Saharan). The main armament varied: 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons (see the [[AS 42]] entry for details), 20 mm anti-tank rifles, and machine guns were common alternatives. For heavier firepower, some were fitted with a Breda M35 47 mm anti-tank gun, which is the variant described in this article. About 200 were built and saw service in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. After the armistice, some continued in use with Fascist Italian forces and Germany, including on the Eastern Front, and in the Ardennes in 1944-45.

Post-war, about a dozen survivors, painted amaranth red and disarmed, were used by the Polizia di Stato in Udine and Bologna.<ref>[[wikipedia:SPA-Viberti_AS.42|[Wikipedia] SPA-Viberti AS.42]]</ref>
