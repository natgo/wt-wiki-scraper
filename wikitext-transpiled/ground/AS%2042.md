== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened as just '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The AS 42 lacks any armour and is very vulnerable to attacks from the air. While the sloped 3 mm of armour and 10 mm thick spare wheel on the front may be sufficient against standard machine guns, most heavy machine guns are able to shred this vehicle and as such it is not recommended to engage in slugging matches.

Though the armour itself is not sufficient against heavy machine guns, it is possible to use the rear engine compartment as armour to protect the crew from the heavy machine guns projectiles. The ammunition compartments at the sides of the vehicle may stop machine guns from penetrating all the way through to knock out the crew, but these have dubious protection in the long run. However, due to these extreme thin armour thickness, standard armour-piercing rounds tend to penetrate straight through with minimal damage. In addition, the gun cannot traverse to fire directly at the back of the AS 42, and in any case the gunner is still fully exposed. Your best protection is going to be hard cover and the element of surprise; don't let the enemy get a shot at you. The AS 42 has 2 crew with ammo located in the flanks of the car. The gun's armour will only protect the gunner in rare cases. The small profile makes it easy to conceal the vehicle in realistic battles, especially from aircraft's sight.

'''Armour type:'''

* Structural steel (chassis, gun breech, gun mount)
* Wheel (tires & spares)
* Gun Steel (cannon barrel)

'''Notes:'''

* Tires are 10 mm thick. * There is a spare tire on the front and on the rear of the vehicle.
* Storage boxes, fuel containers and fenders are 3 mm thick.
* Storage Boxes and fuel Containers cover much of the flanks in addition to the chassis armour.
* The belly of the car is 3 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The tank has very high mobility with speeds exceeding 80 km/h on concrete and 35 km/h offroad. The 4x2 configuration severely reduces the AS 42's effectiveness on soft terrain (snow, mud). The AS 42 cannot turn on the spot, and is best used on roads of sufficient width or open, hilly terrain.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|Breda Mod.35 (20 mm)}}

Your sole armament is a 20 mm autocannon. It is a longer-barreled version of the 20 mm autocannon found on the L6/40 and AB 41, with a bigger magazine capacity, shorter reload time, and similar belt composition. For an anti-aircraft role, the gun has an inferior magazine size and rate of fire. In addition, you don't have a 360° traverse arc, something that is detrimental when engaging aircraft or enemy tanks.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - The belt composition means that 75% of the shells (HEFI-T*) are useless against tanks. However, this belt is reliable against open-topped or lightly armoured targets like SPAA vehicles.

* '''Granata mod.35:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - This belt does little damage against armoured targets and should be used especially against aircraft or open-topped vehicles. The high-explosive filler is deadly to crew members.

* '''Perforante mod.35:''' {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} - This belt offers a good transition from the Default to the PzGr 40 belt. The round offers decent damage against lightly armoured tanks, especially at close range. Due to lack of high-explosive filler, however, it is better to focus on the PzGr 40 belt to maximize penetration power.

* '''PzGr 40:''' {{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} - Probably the belt with the best penetrating shell for the vehicle. While the damage effects post-penetration can be quite poor, the rapid fire from the autocannon can remedy this problem by following up quickly with another penetrating shot. In close combat, these shells should be used against modules and crew member to make the most of each shell. Against angled armour, however, the HVAP ammo may not be very effective.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Combat tactics

The main role of the {{PAGENAME}} is as an anti-air asset. Position the vehicle in an open space to be able to detect aircraft from a distance, usually near your spawn point. You can move forward and stay close to your teammates to offer the best AA support but you'll then become target to enemy tanks (especially with artillery strikes and MG fire). Engage approaching aircraft only under 1,000 m to increase your chances of hitting (ideal distance is 500-700 m) and avoid being detected too early. Your fire rate and clip size is poor for an AA gun so you have to shoot precisely and make every shot count. Your vehicle's protection is non-existent: plan to have an obstacle nearby you can use as cover (building, rock formation, etc).

You can also play as a scout car on some maps: use your speed to flank enemy forces and ambush them. Retreat and relocate after destroying an enemy. Avoid frontal engagements at all cost as your vehicle and your crew are fully unprotected. Keep in mind that you have good mobility on hard terrain (solid ground, roads, etc.) but not on soft terrain (mud, sand, snow) because of your tires. The big turn radius of the {{PAGENAME}} also prevents it from sneaking through narrow passages in urban maps. Drive precisely: any obstacle will immobilize you very quickly if you don't pay attention and your mobility is key to your survival in this role.

;Notable enemies

Pretty much any enemy can destroy the {{PAGENAME}} in seconds. The most lethal enemies are:

* Strafing planes. The biggest threat is enemy aircraft, as even a 7.62 mm MG can kill your SPAA in one burst.
* Vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns. They will destroy you from 1 km distance in a heartbeat.
* Tanks firing HEAT or HE shells. The blast effect is deadly to your already limited and unprotected crew.
* Heavily armoured tanks that are immune to your gun, even if you catch them by surprise.

;How to defeat a {{PAGENAME}}

Being a vehicle without any armour, it remains a vehicle easy to destroy: the 2 quickest ways to deal with the {{PAGENAME}} are MG/autocannons and HEAT/HE projectiles. But any shell with explosive filler will do.
Avoid close quarters and engage from long distance to increase your armour advantage while decreasing the {{PAGENAME}}'s firepower.
You can also force your opponent to play on a terrain hindering its mobility (mud, snow, sand) to negate its main advantage. Aim for the driver or the engine to immobilize it, meaning almost certain death for a barely protected vehicle.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High top speed
* Access to PzGr 40 rounds
* Sloped frontal armour, may deflect some rounds
* High penetration for the 20 mm cannon
* Small profile helps when flanking the enemy

'''Cons:'''

* Small magazine for SPAA
* Virtually no protection at all, even rifle rounds will penetrate the armour
* Only has two crew members
* Crew is exposed 

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The AS (Autosahariana) 42 was derived from the AB 41 armoured car. It was, however, unarmoured and did not have the rear driver position. Designed for long-range reconnaissance in North Africa, it had a cross country range of almost 500 miles (800 km). It was also known as the Camionetta Desertica (Desert Weapons Carrier) mod. 42, or "la Sahariana" (the Saharan). The main armament varied: 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons, 20 mm anti-tank rifles, and machine guns were common alternatives. For heavier firepower, some were fitted with a Breda M35 47 mm anti-tank gun, represented by the [[AS 42/47]]. About 200 were built and saw service in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. After the armistice, some continued in use with Fascist Italian forces and Germany, including on the Eastern Front, and in the Ardennes in 1944-5.

Post-war, about a dozen survivors, painted amaranth red and disarmed, were used by the ''Polizia di Stato'' in Udine and Bologna.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPA-Viberti_AS.42</ref>
