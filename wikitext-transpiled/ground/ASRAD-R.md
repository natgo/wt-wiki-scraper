== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]].

The ASRAD-R received a number of improvements over the [[Lvrbv 701]]: The launcher array is now unmanned and located higher above the ground, which allows for the hull to remain in cover while still being effective in all directions thanks to the increased horizontal traverse angles. With access to 8 long-range supersonic missiles, the ASRAD-R proves to be quite deadly, especially against enemy helicopters.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Horizontal traverse of 360° allows for more flexibility compared to the [[Lvrbv 701]]
- BOLIDE missiles with greater range (9 km) and velocity (700 m/s) are a tier II modification
- Access to 1st generation thermals and high magnification in the gunner sight

'''Cons:'''

- Limited anti-ground capabilities due to poor gun depression of -5° and low penetration of 200 mm
- Subpar mobility and armour protection as a result of using the M113 chassis
- High profile and thus easy to spot, especially when the radar is active

== History ==
