== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The ASRAD-R (Advanced Short Range Air Defence System - RBS) is a short range air defence system designed between Rheinmetall and Saab Bofors Dynamics for use in different vehicles. This configuration is mounted in the American M113 APC. The system can use a 3D AESA air search radar with a range of up to 20 km or an infrared search and track (IRST) system, depending on the needs of the customer. Compared to older air defence systems developed in Sweden, the ASRAD uses an unmanned launcher high above the rest of the vehicle, which allows the rest of the hull to stay hidden or buried in defensive positions. The missile employed by the launcher is the RBS-70 (Bolide) that uses a laser beam guidance system. The missile is also designed to be capable of intercepting cruise missiles. Each battery of ASRAD-R systems also equips 4 RBS 70 MANPADS launchers.

Introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]], the ASRAD-R features a good number of improvements over the [[Lvrbv 701]]. The launcher array is now unmanned and located higher above the ground, which allows for the hull to remain in cover while still being effective in all directions thanks to the increased horizontal traverse angles. With access to 8 long-range supersonic missiles, the ASRAD-R proves to be quite deadly, especially against enemy helicopters. Compared to many air defence systems, the ASRAD-R comes with the benefit of having multipurpose missiles: because they are laser beam guided, and they have HEAT warheads, they can be used with some success against enemy ground units, its penetration values are not the greatest, but are enough to go trough the thin armour found in light tanks, APCs, IFVs and other lightly armoured targets, however it would struggle to go trough the thicker armour of MBTs, even from the sides.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The ASRAD-R uses the chassis of M113 armored personnel carrier. With the whole chassis made up of the fragile Aluminium alloy 5083, any heavy machine gun round that is larger than 7.62 mm can cut through its hull at ease. The ASRAD-R is also very vulnerable to overpressure damage and airstrikes. The crew is fairly spread out which usually helps it survive from a single kinetic shot. However, the engine and transmission are placed in front, thus a frontal shot will likely disable its mobility and bring more shots on the ASRAD-R. A successful penetration on the right side of the hull usually detonates the ammo and blows the whole crew up. The unmanned turret contains several critical modules of the fire control system, and the exposed ammo is very volatile to overpressure damage. Thankfully, the ASRAD-R has 8 rounds of smoke grenades which might save your life from the enemy ATGM on occasion.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
As a tracked vehicle, the ASRAD-R adjusts to narrow and rugged terrains and has decent flexibility to evade and take cover while moving. In spite of that, the average speed of ASRAD-R is around 30-40 km/h, and its acceleration and climbing ability aren't so impressive compared to its firepower.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Horizontal traverse of 360° allows for more flexibility compared to the [[Lvrbv 701]]
* BOLIDE missiles with greater range (9 km) and velocity (700 m/s) are a tier II modification
* Access to 1st generation thermals and high magnification in the gunner sight
* Can fire 4 missiles before reloading
* Opto-electronic tracker for locking hostile aircraft without triggering LWS

'''Cons:'''

* Limited anti-ground capabilities due to low penetration of 200 mm
* Subpar mobility and armour protection as a result of using the M113 chassis
* High profile and thus easy to spot, especially when the radar is active
* Relies on thermal sight to find the hostile aircraft because the opto-electronic tracker can't detect the target in the third-person view

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->[[File:ASRAD-R-Finnish.jpg|thumb|349x349px|'''ASRAD-R System''' (This launcher is mounted in the Finnish ItO 2005, but it's the same found in the Swedish ASRAD-R)]]
The ASRAD-R was developed by Rheinmetall and SAAB Bofors Dynamic, the system is a modular Short Range Air Defence System that can be adapted into several platforms, several countries have presented interest in this system, like Greece, Sweden, Germany and Finland.

The system has proven very successful thanks to it's modular design, since it allows customers to integrate advanced air defence capabilities for ground forces into old vehicles, like the M113 APC and the German "Wiesel". Mounted in these two platforms and also in the Finish ItO 2005. The ASRAD-R can use different weapon systems, for instance, the Swedish variant uses the RBS-70 (Bolide) while the Greek Army uses the Stinger missile in what's called  the ASRAD-HELLAS.

During deployment ASRAD-R units consists of 4 batteries as the lowest organization unit, and they also equip 4 x RBS 70 MANPADS launchers for usage by the rest of the crew when dismounted or by infantry around the batteries. The vehicle can use an AESA 3D search radar or an IRST (Infrared Search and Track) system depending on the customer's demand.

The Swedish version of the ASRAD-R is mounted in the M113 APC and uses the already mentioned RBS-70 Bolide missile. This system uses the SAAB Microwave Systems HARD 3D search radar with a range of up to 20KM operating in the X band. This radar has 3 modes, the MTI (moving target indicator) mode for fixed-wing targets, helicopter mode for helicopter detection and analysis and a non-MTI mode for increased sensitivity and detection of tangential targets. The Bolide missile has a maximum range of 8KM and an altitude coverage of 5000M, with a laser beam guidance system, that uses automatic tracking based on the radar lock to intercept the target.

A naval version of the ASRAD-R was announced in 2007 by Rheinmetall and SAAB Bofors Dynamic, the naval variant includes 4 x RBS-70 mounted on a pedestal with upgraded sensors and subsystems against helicopters and fixed wing aircrafts but specially against high speed cruise missile, it also includes a CCD TV eyesafe laser rangefinder.
