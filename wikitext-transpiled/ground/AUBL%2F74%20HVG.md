== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ('''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6293-special-operation-h-e-a-t-en|2019 Operation H.E.A.T event]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
'''Armour Type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)
* Wheel (tires)

'''Notes:'''

* The tires are 10 mm thick and the suspension rods are 1 mm thick.
* The side engine grilles are only 5 mm thick, so make sure to protect those weak points.
* There is an engine grille on the roof which is also only 5 mm thick. A weak point planes might look to take advantage of.
* A tightly spaced crew of three makes it easily taken out by machine guns and autocannons.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=248|rbMinHp=142}}

The AUBL/74's mobility is great. It can reach up to 100 km/h, with an average speed off-road of 46-56 km/h. It retains nice control over manoeuvrability even at high speeds. However, mobility really suffers on snow or mud and severely hampers your speed. The {{PAGENAME}} also has amphibious capabilities, although speed in the water is limited to around 4 km/h.

==== Ammunition ====
'''M300:''' This will be your default ammunition option, and realistically the only ammunition worth using. This round has decent penetration and is effective against angled armour, but it may face difficulty penetrating heavily armoured targets. Due to its small post-penetration damage, it is necessary to aim for important crew and modules.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

For the AUBL/74, it is recommended you play in ground realistic battles. This vehicle should be played as either a Scout, Flanker or a Sniper. Use your mobility to relocate from one sniper position to another. Never brawl unless you have to. Due to the highly mobile platform (FIAT 6616), your mobility is one of the best in its class. Use your mobility to get to a good attack position early in the game to launch a surprise attack from the side. Use the terrain and obstruction to hide from enemy. Use the "free-look" button ("C" by default) to look around frequently to learn the situation around you. Make sure nobody is looking at your way before you poke out and fire. As a light tank, you also have the ability to scout enemy players; allowing you to gather intel on the positions of the enemy team, as well as earn points for each vehicle destroyed via your intel alongside assist credit. It's important to note that the AUBL/74 trades armour for mobility and you don't have any armour on this vehicle. With only 8 mm of armour on the front of the hull, the armour on this vehicle won't even stop high-calibre machine gun fire at mid-range. Don't even think about surviving a hit, it's impossible unless it's a sub-calibre APDS or APFSDS round in which case it may pass straight through the vehicle without inflicting any damage. You'll also be at the mercy of artillery, and due to pressure damage you will die very quickly to artillery. Another issue you'll encounter is enemy aircraft, most of their suspended armament and even at times their main cannons or heavy machine guns will take you out with ease. Again, try to keep moving positions or utilize cover, where enemy aircraft have no way of damaging your vehicle. The main armament on this vehicle is a 60 mm HVG cannon made by OTO Melara. It can fire two types of rounds, APFSDS and HE. The HE shell is useless due to the small explosive mass. The only shell you will use is M300 APFSDS shell. It will penetrate 249 mm of armour at close range, fairly decent as a light tank but not enough to penetrate the front of some heavy tanks. Due to the small diameter, the post-penetration damage it inflicts is limited. Try to launch attacks from the side or rear of the target, and aim for important modules first like the gunner or cannon breech. You might not get a one shot kill but you will divert the opponents' attention away from your teammates. The cannon is two-plane stabilized which gives you an advantage to shoot first as a light tank.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High engine HP/weight ratio and amazing top speed
* Perfect mobility on roads and urban environments
* Decent speed on plain fields, enough to keep up with light tanks
* Easy to control even at high speeds
* A rather small size vehicle, difficult to target and easy to hide
* Smoke grenade launchers located on the turret, a player can choose which side of the tank to cover
* Has an anti-aircraft light machine gun
* Decent armament for a light tank: acceptable rate of fire and penetration plus near-perfect accuracy using APFSDS
* APFSDS rounds have excellent angled penetration, very useful against targets such as the Strv 103s
* Two-plane stabilizer allows accurate fire on the move
* Has premium status, granting increased RP & SL
* Can navigate water features
* Outfitted with night vision devices

'''Cons:'''

* Stabilizer only works up to 75 km/h
* Horrible mobility in shallow water and snow results in heavy dependence on roads
* The main gun, while accurate, has a low calibre of 60 mm, more than one shot is often required to take out an enemy tank
* Small crew of three
* Next to no armour, vulnerable even to light machine gunfire
* Easily taken out by SPAA and other light tanks
* Driver's view ports greatly limit the gun depression on front-right of the tank
* All six smoke grenades are launched at once
* While swimming, it can only go around 4-5 km/h
* Does not have thermal vision capabilities

The story of the AUBL HVG begins during the Cold War. The AUBL, also known as the Fiat 6616, was a joint venture between Fiat and OTO Melara. After the Second World War, Italy learned the need for light armoured and armed vehicles. After having built the Fiat 6614, OTO Melara experimented by seeing how adding a cannon would do for the vehicle, with also the main focus being for the Fiat 6616 to carry heavier armament for the armoured platoons of the mobile battalions. After several alterations the first prototype was built in 1972, and with many minor improvements, Italy would decide to buy 50 for the Carabinieri (Military Police). It officially entered service in 1975 with a total of 185 units produced. The Fiat 6616 was a great light vehicle that would be able to reach high speeds of 100 km/h if on the right terrain. After Italy had bought theirs, it was decided that the next course of action was to put it on the market, and countries such as Peru and Somalia showed interest and acquired the vehicle. Those countries actually used it in combat, specifically the Somalians. One of the many upsides of the Fiat 6616 was the ability of it being able to travel submerged underwater, increasing its versatility. It was able to fit many different types of armaments, such as a 20 mm Rheinmetall Mk.20 Rh 202 gun, a 60 mm OTO-Breda T60 quick firing HVG, French made HS90, FV101 turret, and also a 90 mm Cockerill Mk.3 cannon. Other equipment that could also be installed came in the form of a unique flare dispenser which would be used for crowd dispersal; many different types of ATGMs such as Milan, MAPAT and TOW, and for export purposes, the Peruvian version would mount an HJ-73C Chinese made ATGM. After having a very extensive service record (Libya safekeeping, Lebanon UN safekeeping, protecting places of high interest in Italy) it was put out of service, now only some remain as static displays or are in storage inside Italy; however as previously mentioned some of the countries that acquired them still use them to this day. The AUBL/74 HVG was first seen in 1989, in the form of 1 singular prototype known. The AUBL/74 HVG would not be picked up by the Italian army nor anyone from the export market, although it could fire OTO-HE and MECAR APFSDS-T (which could penetrate up to 130 mm at 60 degrees from 1,500 m), which allowed it to be a great reconnaissance vehicle for the time, the project didn't continue and OTO Melara continued to experiment on the vehicle by adding more and more diverse armaments in the hopes more nations would acquire it.
