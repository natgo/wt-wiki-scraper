== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Urdu: الخال; lit. eternal) is the Pakistani upgraded variant of NORINCO's [[MBT-2000|MBT2000]] by 2020s retrofitted by Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT). After the development of Sino-Pakistani MBT2000 passed for certification by both PLAGF and Pakistan Army, the first series Al-Khalid joined Pakistan Army in 2001 as their new MBT alongside with imported Ukrainian T-80UD against foes; while the MBT received very positive opinion from its operators, the tank would still require further upgrades to keep up with the mainstream of MBT development, especially against Indian Army which have received [[Bhishma TWMP|T-90S]] and planned for the T-90SM. With sufficient supply engine pack from Ukrainian KMDB and experiences gained on T 85-IIAP's production, Al-Khalid-I eventually received FCS and ergonomic upgrades by 2010s; officially introduced on 28th July 2020, the upgraded tank is now replacing the previous fleet of T 59/69 and further boosting the national defense capability of Pakistan with plans to further upgrade the vehicle with Chinese powerpack and redesigned turret in progress.

Introduced in [[Update "Dance of Dragons"]] as a new premium pack for Chinese tech tree, players of the MBT-2000 would soon get the grip on Al-Khalid-I with identical handling, firepower and protection. For new players, the tank features a powerful 1,200 hp engine with great reverse speed, while the mobility can make sure players can invade the flanks of enemies and delivery fatal blow to them; while the protection might not be the best of its tier, it can still sometimes save the tank from total destruction.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The Al-Khalid-I's armour layout is very similar to the original MBT2000 but still has some changes. The base steel and composite armour is completely identical. Cosmetically, the FY-2 ERA is installed in the form of smaller tiles. This doesn't make any difference on the turret cheeks because the entire damage model is grouped together. Looking at the hull, on the sloped upper glacis, the ERA tile groups are smaller and slightly more numerous, which makes them more resistant to being stripped away by repeated attacks, but the bottom row of ERA that used to help cover the flat "lip" of the glacis housing the headlights is now missing, replaced by a couple of track segments. This is a bit of a letdown because that segment of the composite armour is not completely resistant to 3BM42-class APFSDS without FY-2 covering it, and makes the Al-Khalid-I's hull weak spots larger than the MBT2000's.

The main advertised difference is that FY-2 is installed on the front and sides of the storage racks on the sides of the turret bustle. The flush FY-2 tiles on the sides of the turret cheeks have been removed. The effects of this change are mostly positive but also slightly mixed. The storage racks are now capable of blocking HEAT-FS rounds, autocannon rounds, and weak ATGMs even in direct side attacks, but the less protected turret cheek sides can sometimes allow attacks from the front-side arcs to damage the turret crew.

Although it has no bearing on the actual protection, another cosmetic difference is that the Al-Khalid-I has two tall and unusually thick radio antennas, which can be more easily noticed by enemies when hiding behind cover.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Al-Khalid-I retained the Ukrainian Kharkov 6TD-2 engine pack as its power source for mobility and logistical reasons. Thanks to the revised transmission with additional side gears, this enables the tank to reverse at up to -31 km/h, more than enough to retreat from danger.

{{main|ZPT98 (125 mm)}}

As 125 mm calibre has been selected as the calibre for Pakistan Army and the vehicle was developed mostly by NORINCO of Mainland China, Al-Khalid-I also selected the same cannon as ZTZ99 series - the ZPT98 cannon. All the specifications and ammunition options are totally identical to its Chinese cousins aside from having 49 spare ammo as demanded by Pakistan; while the traverse is sufficient at its tier at a much higher speed than Soviet/Russian serial production MBTs, be sure to turn the turret beforehand just in case - NATO tanks mostly have better traverse rate than Al-Khalid.

==== Ammunition ====
{{:ZPT98 (125 mm)/Ammunition|DTP-125, DTB-125, Type 1985-I APFSDS, DTC10-125, DTB12-125}}'''''Note: As premium vehicle, all ammunition is researched once purchased'''''

'''DTP-125, HEAT-FS, Stock''' - DTP-125 has been a long-time friend to the Chinese 125 mm gun and is one of the stock shells for the Al-Khalid-I; like many HEATFS of its tier, due to ERA and composite armour being commonplace at its tier, hitting enemies from the front would very likely be fruitless. So if opting for HEATFS to take out enemies, make sure to aim for non-ERA/composite covered parts or by flanking enemies if possible; remembering where their ammunition is located can earn players a quick kill against enemies. It is still a versatile shell to have against all types of ground target.

'''DTB-125, HE-FS, Stock''' - DTB-125 is also available as the other stock shell; HEFS can serve as a makeshift anti-tank shell by hitting enemy optics or top plates with low protection and possibly triggering overpressure, dooming the crew and internal compartments of enemy vehicles. This also enables the tank to do "top-down" attacks against tanks behind cover, notably NATO tanks with higher profile and CITV. Thanks to the high explosive content, it is also a better option to knock-out light vehicles right away than the HEATFS.

'''125-I, APFSDS, Tier I''' - 125-I (aka 一期弹 or officially, the 一步弹; Phrase/Stage I ammunition) has already been a familiar APFSDS for Chinese MBTs with 125 mm gun, players from ZTZ96 series can soon get on hand with the APFSDS with its good ballistic performance and penetration (the highest for 125 mm APFSDS <500 mm penetration), helping players to go through the stock stages; aim for different weak spots accordingly if facing higher-tier NATO/Warsaw-Pact tanks.

'''DTC10-125, APFSDS, Tier IV''' - as the main APFSDS of PLAGF and one of the highest-penetration (non-DU) export APFSDS for 125 mm guns, DTC10-125 (aka 三期弹 or officially, the 三步弹; Phrase/Stage III ammunition; DTC10E when export) can make sure it can also utilize its very high velocity to defeat most enemies it face without problem, this also enables Al-Khalid-I to defeat more advanced MBTs at higher-tier even at long range.

'''DTB12-125, HE-FS (VT), Tier IV''' - Unlike Soviet/Russian HE-FS with timed fuse, DTB12 is currently the only HE-VT for its calibre; not only can it still be used as "anti-tank" shells like its stock counterpart albeit with lesser explosive content, enemy aircraft will have to face a 125 mm makeshift AA gun with 7 m trigger radius - it is never a good idea getting hit by such a huge shell.

For sustained combat endurance and demands from Pakistan, the Al-Khalid-I has 49 shells and its propellant onboard scattered around the chassis, mostly concentrated around the turret carousel. While having so many ammunition means missed shots can be compensated by subsequent shots (given the autoloader is not damaged), this also turns the tank into a walking powder keg at full-load, turning the tank into a firework show is never the best idea to end a battle; 23 shells in the autoloader and pre-load of breech are more than enough to finish the battle with relatively ease.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Although it has a number of small differences in terms of protection and appearance, the Al-Khalid-I plays mostly like a slightly improved MBT2000 with better thermal optics - the gunner enjoys an improvement in resolution and the commander receives brand new thermals on the CITV of the same resolution (however it is still saddled with a fixed 6x zoom, unlike the variable 3x-10.7x CITV zoom of the ZTZ99s). Like the MBT2000, it has a very nice reverse speed and responsive handling by Soviet/Chinese standards because of its powerpack, and the overall protection is quite good, less so for the hull but above average on the turret. It can be played as a mobile flanker or midfielder. The reverse speed allows it to move beyond solid cover and perform shoot-and-scoot tactics much more easily than other Chinese tanks and the combination of both low and high zoom settings on the gunner optics is comfortable for brawling and sniping. Do note that the inherent protection is inferior to the ZTZ99s, as the composite armour is rather weaker and FY-2 is not as strong as FY-4, so take advantage of the mobility to move between good positions and avoid keeping the hull exposed to enemy fire.

=== Pros and cons ===
'''Pros:'''

* Slightly improved protection with larger ERA coverage at turret front and additions on turret baskets
* Powerful main cannon with varieties of ammunition
* Commander override of turret for retaliation
* Excellent mobility
** 1,200 hp engine with sufficient T/W ratio for flanking tactics
** Revised transmission enables pseudo-neutral steering and high reverse speed
* Two different magnifications for different engage range with large FOV
* Upgraded with 3rd generation TVD for both gunner and CITV
* Thick turret protection

'''Cons:'''

* Fixed 7.1 second reload and infamous AZ-172 autoloader with high detonation rate once being hit
* Inconsistent protection
** Cast-welded mantle still haunts the frontal protection
** Insufficient protection at its tier, especially compared to ZTZ99 or T-90 series
* Slow gun vertical traverse due to hydraulic drive
* Engine deck with raised-up plates that blocks rear arc of fire
* Cramped crew layout and densely packed ammunition onboard
