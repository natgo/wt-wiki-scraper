== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Soviet armoured vehicle designed with the intent of serving as a replacement for its predecessor, the BA-10. It was the first and only Soviet heavy armoured car produced, and it saw very limited service due to production ceasing after the Nazi Germany invasion in 1941. Compared to the BA-10, the {{Specs|name}} featured a sophisticated armour design, providing better protection for its crew, and a more powerful engine, which was said to be more reliable. Despite this, it was considered a disappointment as a result of numerous design flaws and technical issues, and its performance in battle was subpar. Further attempts at improvement were made with the replacement of the petrol engine with a diesel ZIS-D-7, but these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful due to the vehicle's poor reputation. In the end, all 17 vehicles built were lost in combat, and the project was abandoned.

The {{Specs|name}} was introduced during [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]] as a reward for [[Season 2: Attack from the Sea]]. It is an excellent flanker and plays essentially the same as the BT-5. Surprisingly, its crew layout allows it to tank some shots, as long as it's not hit in the flat parts of the armour. However, it is important to keep a low profile, as the BA-11 can't survive even a single strafing run by an aircraft due to its thin roof armour.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

Armour on the BA-11 is unfortunately inadequate against most tank armaments that it can encounter. It's only thick enough to resist rifle-calibre machine gun fire, whereas heavy machine gun rounds have more than enough power to shred the car's body apart. In terms of surviving a frontal encounter with a tank shell, the only hope is that the engine and fuel tank modules will stop the shell from reaching the crew compartment. However, the BA-11 is vulnerable to overpressure so an HE shell will at best immobilize the BA-11 if not outright destroy it.

If shot, the front compartment with engine and transmission module can immobilise the vehicle. The center driving compartment containing the driver and another crew member, with the transmission right underneath to, again, cripple the vehicle's mobility. The fighting compartment in the rear with the turret is fully stowed with ammunition with the gun crew, and so a shot there can cause an ammunition detonation that would make short work of the BA-11's life.

Finally, the roof armour on the {{PAGENAME}} is not sufficient against most type of strafing attacks either, so enemy aircraft going for a gun run will be dangerous to a {{PAGENAME}} user.

The small calibre of the DT machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help. The clip capacity of the machine gun is quite poor, as it relies on a magazine of 63 bullets instead of a belt like similar machine guns from other nations.

== Usage in battles ==

The Ba-11 is one of the only armoured cars in the Soviet Tech Tree and as an armoured car it suffers from a few issues, like poor mobility off-road and a very weak armour. However it still has some advantages going for him, like its armament and crew placement.

When used in ground realistic or arcade battles, it is important to have a low profile. Since this vehicle is not well-armoured, it wont be able to survive even strafing runs from aircrafts, specially those who are equipped with 12.7mm MGs. This also means that going in flanking manoeuvres against enemy SPAA is not recommended, because you lack HE projectiles or a roof mounted HMG like the one present in American tanks, it is hard to destroy quickly open top vehicles since its very possible that the fuse in your APHE projectiles wont set off.

Talking about that, the best thing going for the Ba-11 is its armament, the Soviet 45mm D-20K cannon is more than enough to destroy a target. At low BRs, most tanks are small and very cramped, and the APHE projectile of this gun, with almost 30G of TNT explosive, it's enough to one-shot most opponents, specially small tanks like the M22 and the Panzer III. Its penetration values are also very good, being capable of dealing with the armour of pretty much every low BR tank at short ranges.

It is not recommended going flanking in the Ba-11, the wheeled design makes it so that it's very easy getting stuck in holes, rocks or any terrain irregularity, however it's also not recommended since off-road mobility is severely reduced when wheels are used instead of tracks, meanwhile the wheels allow for higher speeds as long as you are travelling on asphalt roads.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!--Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".-->

'''Pros:'''

* Good gun depression of 8 degrees
* Car forward mobility is quite good off and on-road, so long as it can pick up speed
* Front profile rather small due to its long body
* Very good firepower, APHE round can one shot most tanks

'''Cons:'''

* Armour is only sufficient against rifle-calibre machine guns, anything more will shred the car apart
* Roof armour above the crew at its thickest is 8 mm, which allows most aircraft to penetrate with a strafing run
* Interior layout allows any penetrating shot to deal critical damage to something
* Vehicle length means it can present a large target if driving perpendicular to an enemy gun
* Reverse speed is disappointing, restricting ability to withdraw into cover easily

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

Armoured cars were one of the most popular world trends in the development of armoured vehicles in the pre-war period. The Soviet heavy armoured vehicle BA-11 was one of the typical examples of this type of vehicle. It was created on the basis of a shortened chassis from the military ZIS-6 - a three-axle off-road truck designed on a scheme of 6x4 (rear wheel drive). The new chassis designed by engineers of the Moscow Automobile Plant was supposed to provide the armoured car greater payload and a better cross-country ability which allows improvements in the armour and a better off-road performance in the vehicle.

Compared to the armoured vehicles of the B-6 and B-10 series which had been designed on the basis of the GAZ-AAA truck, the armour of the BA-11 has been increased by 1.5-2 times and in some places, the BA-11 was slightly better armoured than the T-26 and BT-7 tanks. With the increased weight up to 8 tons, the vehicle maintained good driving characteristics: a speed of up to 64 km/h on the highway and 26 km/h over terrain. As well as in the BA-10 the designers also provided overall tracks which were able to help the armoured car to overcome particularly difficult areas. The gun and the turret of the vehicle also receives a 45 mm 20-K cannon from the BA-10 in the turret.

The heavy BA-11 armoured vehicle was produced in limited edition in 1939 and participated in battles at the early stages of WWII. In 1942 it was withdrawn from service.
