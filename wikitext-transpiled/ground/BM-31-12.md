The '''{{Specs|name}}''', also known as "Andryusha", is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8227-event-legend-of-victory-bm-31-12-andryusha-en|2023 Legend of Victory event]]. A highly unusual vehicle, reminiscent of its smaller brother, the [[BM-13N]]. Not only is its truck-based configuration not the most common, but it also uses 12 x 300 mm M-31-UK rockets as its main armament, has limited traverse, has only 2 crew members, and a gun depression of +8°. The last is somewhat compensated by its ability to lean forwards with a [[Hydropneumatic suspension|hydropneumatic suspension system]] usually found on higher rank vehicles. Its gameplay is best compared with its smaller sibling, the [[BM-13N|BM-13N "Katyusha"]].

The Andryusha is an artillery piece, belonging more in an artillery formation than in a tank battle. One should stay at a distance from the enemies since its rockets have a blind zone of about 800 m in front of the truck when moving on a flat surface.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Being designed for rear-line support, the  BM-31-12 lacks any real armour. Being a simple truck, even rifle-calibre machine guns can penetrate the vehicle and knock out the two crew members. Therefore, the vehicle is extremely vulnerable to overpressure (HE shells, rockets, bombs, and artillery strikes) as well as strafing aircraft and tank coaxial/roof machine guns. It is best to play at a distance from the frontline and with some cover nearby to retreat behind once the enemy presence increases, as your mobility isn't great either.

'''Armour type:'''

*Rolled homogeneous armour (Roof and window covers)
*Structural steel (Chassis and driver's cabin)
*Gun Steel (Rocket launcher)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

There are two main ways to use the Andryusha, which are very similar in playstyle to its smaller sibling, the [[BM-13N|Katyusha]]

'''Artillery'''

Usage of this vehicle in its intended role of rear-line support and artillery strike. One should estimate the correct angle, shoot a rocket, watch where it lands, adjust fire, and retry it as needed. Do not take too much time with this method of rangefinding since a single retaliatory shot can end your day. Once the correct sight distance is found, unleash hell on your enemies, blinding them with dust lifting up from the ground, detonating ammo racks and blasting off tracks. This is basically an intelligent artillery barrage. Once all rockets are fired, fall back behind allied lines, find a captured objective to reload at, and repeat. Keep in mind that the M-31-UK rockets have a very loud launch noise, and will alert enemies all around to your presence.

There is little the Andryusha can do against enemy aircraft, which can destroy the vehicle with as little as a half-second machine gun burst or a relatively close detonation of a bomb or rocket. Try not to get caught out in the open, and try to hide behind obstacles. It's always recommended to have friendly cover while playing this vehicle.

'''Ambusher'''

Best used in urban or dense maps, where enemies will usually rush down a path or corridor quickly without checking all of their surroundings. Find yourself a pile of rubble or other kind of short cover and lower the front suspension of the truck in such a way that you can fire right in front of you just past the obstacle. When an enemy passes by, simply hit it with a rocket. This tactic is often a last resort when you're cornered and encircled. You may destroy one or more enemies if you're lucky, but you will eventually be caught or your rockets will run out.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

*Very powerful 300 mm rockets with a high explosive mass. Able to take out almost all vehicles in a single direct hit
*Adjustable suspension
*Can be used in deceptions: a similar model is used as a static decoration on some maps, with a different launcher and with the armour plates lifted. This may allow the player to hide in plain sight. Works better when in groups of 2 Andryushas or more, and especially if someone in your squad has the [[BM-13N|Katyusha]]

'''Cons:'''

*Very poor survivability
*Has issues traversing rough and muddy terrains, to be expected from a wheeled vehicle
*Poor horizontal launcher traverse
*Low ammunition supply of 12 rockets
*Loud and distinguishable firing sound
*Lacks other armaments beside rockets
*Large dead zone in front of vehicle, up to 800 m on level terrain (launcher depression of +10°)
*Vehicle cannot move properly while suspension is adjusted
