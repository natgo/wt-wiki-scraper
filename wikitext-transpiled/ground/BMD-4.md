== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Red Skies"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7267-event-summer-landing-en|2021 Summer Landing event]]. In a simple comparison to the similar-performing vehicle, the [[BMP-3]], the {{PAGENAME}} has less armour, higher mobility and faster ATGM reload.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The BMD-4 is very poorly armoured. The front has an adequate armour thickness, but the upper front plate of the hull is more vulnerable than the turret or the lower front plate and allow for penetrations with 12.7 mm MG, even from afar. Autocannons are very likely to just shred this tank instantly, but how soon this happens depends on enemy attention span, autocannon rate of fire and where an enemy aims first.

Researching mobility modules adds some of them to the front of the tank, which reduces likelihood of taking overpressure damage from ATGMs and increases chances of blocking autocannon rounds when they hit the hull.

The roof is vulnerable to even HEAT overpressure and turret hits with chemical shells are very dangerous for this tank. It is easy for planes to strafe the BMD-4 from above for the same reason.

There are 3 crew members, both turret crew members can fire all weapons, so it is not enough to take out the gunner to stop BMD-4 and it will not just explode upon being hit like [[Shturm-S]], so at the very least it can return fire after being hit.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The BMD-4 somewhat resembles [[BMP-2]] in terms of mobility, but can drive equally fast in either direction and accelerates much faster.

It is possible to control the suspension on the BMD-4, but only a bit. Suspension controls allow to slightly tilt the BMD-4 forward or backwards or lower/raise the hull a bit. Tilting is mostly important for RB, where it helps the tank to gain more gun depression on a hill, but can also be used in AB to either hide the UFP or to prevent the gun from bouncing too high up while charging.

It also can swim, like other Soviet light tanks.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

{{main|2A72 (30 mm)}}

The 30 mm fires the same shells as the [[BMP-2]] autocannon does and is identical to the one on the [[BMP-3]]. There is only one rate of fire option for the cannon - which is relatively slow at 300 rounds per minute. Despite the low fire rate, it still fires faster than the one on the [[Warrior]] and if the player fires first, it can neutralize many light tanks at close to medium range before the BMD-4 is knocked out from their retaliatory fire.

The autocannon counts as the main weapon and 100 mm is fired with the "additional weapon" keybind. The aim assist and scope is, therefore, displayed for the 30 mm gun. While this is fine if the BMD-4 user uses an ATGM, but the only way to swap scope to acquire aim assist for the 100 mm gun to land precise hits with HE shells is to switch from the main weapon view to the secondary weapon view . This, unfortunately, breaks the weapon layout, and the 30 mm becomes unusable until the control scheme is reset.

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}

<!-- ''Some tanks are armed with several guns in one or more turrets. Evaluate the additional weaponry and give advice on its use. Describe the ammunition available for additional weaponry. Give advice on about how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage. If there is no additional weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|2A70 (100 mm)}}

The 100 mm of this tank is near identical to the one on the [[BMP-3]]. However, its autoloader can load ATGMs as well, removing the 28-second reload penalty which makes the BMP-3 unsuitable for skirmish, at a cost of 1 second of reload time overall.

While the gun is stabilized, it is not a very good idea to rush uphill at full speed until gun drives were upgraded as the gun has poor depression and kicks upwards when the tank drives uphill. Without upgrades, it will not put itself back on target in time, and the tank can't sustain even accidental hits unlike the BMP-3.

Gun itself can bring two different ammunition types into battle, although the choice are limited to chemical energy shells. The ammunition choices are: Slow HE (3OF70) , super slow HE (3OF32) and Tandem HEAT ATGM (9M117M1). It is only possible to take 4 ATGMs. Overall, it is similar to the BMP-3.

HE shells are mostly designed to be fired in a mortar fashion and for comfortable use it is necessary to install laser rangefinder or to play in AB mode. Unlike with the BMP-3, it is also necessary to swap primary weapon to "secondary weapon" to be able to aim HE precisely. The projectiles fall very slowly, but they are also very small and will often squeeze in-between ERA bricks and hit the enemy tank roof, causing overpressure damage and destroying the target. Overall, they can be used to harass other tanks out of cover (including ATGM carriers) or fired along with the autocannon to blow up light tanks in general melee range (although it is very awkward and slower than with the BMP-3).

The missiles are launched at near maximum speed from the get go, which makes them ones of the deadliest at the rank (as many missiles at the BR start at around 250 m/s at best), but also make them mostly unsuitable for trick shots of any kind and require direct launch. Tandem missiles usually do not even require user to aim any more than in the enemy tanks direction. Missiles also have huge area of the blast wave, but BMD-4 cannot just destroy all of the surrounding cover as it itself is fragile and needs it to survive, so some restraint should be kept, at least until you are sure that it's possible to get away with such behaviour.

Ammunition rearm for 100 mm on a capture point takes about 6 seconds, which means that this tank can almost indefinitely spam ATGM at incoming enemies if its user can hold the line. Make sure to choose ATGM as the top ammunition in ammo distribution UI, as otherwise HE will be rearmed first.

Weapons are not rearmed outside of the capture point in AB, even if it only uses ATGMs, so the tank cannot be used as a standoff sniper in AB for long, but is rather to be sacrificed in a deep flank.

In terms of what types of ammunition to bring in, two types of combination can be made between the standard HE shells and the ATGM, as {{PAGENAME}} can only bring two selected ammo into battle:

- ATGM + HE = the player can default to ATGM to react to armoured threats in a pinch, but switch over to HE shells to bombard the enemy from a distance if they are behind cover or in other similar situations. The HE shells can also be used to fight light tanks at close range, even if the BMD-4 runs out of ATGM. Slower HE can fire vertically at ranges as close as 400 m, but may fail to penetrate medium tanks and it is easier to see for moving targets, so the faster 3OF70 HE shell might be a better choice sometimes.
- HE + HE = Not recommended, as neither of the 100 mm HE shells could deal with most medium tanks directly. Enemies in general will show no mercy to a BMD-4 since they will always assume the BMD-4 is carrying a ATGM, so its best to respond to this threat with an ATGM rather than HE shells.

;Arcade mode<nowiki>:</nowiki>

There are two main ways to use BMD-4 efficiently, both involve using its high movement speed.

First way is to attack into a capture point by using ATGM based loadout. BMD-4 cannot sustain frontal damage and can only take one hit before exploding. It is necessary to have high reaction time, good crew and the element of surprise. Try to arrive at the fighting location first and take cover at a suitable fighting position. If you want to do something extra, it is possible to tinker with suspension to lower BMD-4 hull even more to hide as much of the hull as possible.

There is also an option of attacking not the capture point itself, but to rush past it and to attack the first encounter group, preferably from a side. If you manage to pounce on them, it is possible to take out three tanks before other enemy tanks notice that something is wrong and destroy the BMD-4.

The reason why rushing in such a fragile tank is even a viable option is because that way BMD-4 can quickly rearm after fighting and either attack by spamming ATGMs from the cap or continue its conquest elsewhere.

Second way is to deliberately give up working on a capture point and instead to do a deep flank around enemy team and unload BMD-4s entire arsenal onto enemy snipers. This works because BMD-4 moves insanely fast for a Soviet light tank and has ATGM which reloads almost as fast as the gun on the [[Object 906]], while being absolutely lethal regardless of the enemy tank armour level. If the range between your firing position and an enemy is more than 400 m, it is also possible to continue annoying them by launching 3OF32 at them over cover (swap main weapon towards 100 mm to acquire proper aim assist on the HE).

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Moves quite fast even when stock, can drive fast in either direction unlike BMPs
- Autoloader with a 5-second reload for ATGMs (fastest ATGM reload, reloads faster than most conventional tanks as well)
- Can fire on the move without restrictions
- ATGMs start at near maximum speed, do very high damage on direct hit and have a wide blast and overpressure area
- Commander can still fire weapons even if the gunner was shot
- Also can fire HE at enemy tank roofs by using laser rangefinder or AB aim assist
- Also has an autocannon which can be fired along with the main weapon
- Can act as a scout and also has thermal scope, smoke grenades and ESS, which can be used to scout or fight
- Is amphibious, allowing safe travels over waterways

'''Cons:'''

- Low armour protection, hull upper front plate can be penetrated even by a 12.7 MG until movement modules are researched, which will protect BMD-4 from some frontal shots or even block overpressure
- Only 3 crew members
- Extremely awkward sight controls for HE - to even access it, user must swap main weapon to "secondary weapon" which disables the autocannon and MG completely
- While missiles high launch speed is good for sudden encounters and ambushes, it is near impossible to land a vertical shot with them, and HE needs quite some range to get on target, so if someone does area denial strategy at close range, BMD-4 can't do anything about it
- In AB, ATGM cannot be rearmed outside of a capture point, as BMD-4 counts as a normal tank

===[[wt:en/news/7262-development-summer-marathon-vehicles-bmd-4-en|Devblog]]===
A complex of research aimed at increasing the combat effectiveness of the Soviet airborne combat vehicle named "Bakhcha-U" was carried out in the Tula Instrument Design Bureau in the second half of the 90's. As a result of the research, the Volgograd Tractor Plant presented an experimental BMD-4 combat vehicle with the Bakhcha-U module, which was put into service on the last day of 2004. An experimental batch of 60 vehicles was delivered to the 137th Guard Paratrooper Regiment for testing. Compared to the BMD-3, the new vehicle significantly surpassed it in terms of combat effectiveness and technical characteristics.

Much attention was paid to the complex of anti-tank armament - a 100 mm cannon-launcher could use guided missiles, including missiles with a tandem warhead. During the tests of the pilot batch, the manufacturer went bankrupt and Kurganmashzavod continued work on the vehicle. During the modernization, an improved version of the IFV was created, which entered service with the Russian army under the name BMD-4M.
