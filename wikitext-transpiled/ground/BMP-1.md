== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]].

The {{PAGENAME}} is more of a shoot-and-scoot type of vehicle as an exposed {{PAGENAME}} is a dead {{PAGENAME}}, so it avoids being a target at all costs. It can also use its mobility to find reasonable sniping spots (for ATGM) and generally only use the cannon if an enemy is close and unaware of its presence, unless it's in arcade mode, where it can land artillery-like shots easily.

Remember that if anything sees the BMP, it can and should destroy it immediately, as it is extremely dangerous if left unattended - even a .50 cal might make quick work of the {{PAGENAME}} from the left side or the back.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} has very little to speak of in the conventional armour department. Minimal frontal and nearly non-existent side armour results in the vehicle being vulnerable to almost any incoming fire under many angles. Sides, particularly the left one, are poorly defended and can be penetrated by 12.7 mm or bigger MG, the flatter the angle of attack, the faster will the BMP-1 give in and explode. Front is also weak enough to be penetrated by HMG, but it is very angled and can only be shot through by a tall tank from the top. 14.5 mm will occasionally bounce off, but if its user will actually go to MG sniper mode and fire straight at the tanks weakspots, it will not sustain.

As such, the vehicle's survivability stems from its internal modules, mobility and short profile. Despite the lack of armour, the engine compartment on the right side might block a lot of shots (even ATGM might not break through it sometimes) and it is reasonably difficult to hit closer to the turret, where the shot usually proves fatal.

Where possible, BMP should utilise hills or other cover, only exposing as much of the vehicle as is necessary to engage an unaware target. Ideally, only the small turret must be exposed, which makes attacking BMP back even more difficult or at least user should only demonstrate its right side.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=465|rbMinHp=265}}
[[File:GarageImage_BMP-1P.jpg|420px|thumb|right|The BMP-1P with the 9M113 missile equipped.]]

The {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility in RB is reasonably good, although somewhat lacking relative to other IFVs. Despite that, once it gets moving it can travel at a decent pace.

In AB, BMP-1 are very fast, if not the fastest, due to being able to accelerate to average speed of 55-60 km/h offroad very quickly and reaching maximum speed if they do not have to climb, so a determined BMP user can drive straight to a point and expect to meet nobody else, but other fast tanks, like wheeled light tanks or some medium tanks of rank VI (which also have poor armour and generally will not dare to do that).

In RB, be aware when attempting flanking manoeuvres and early pushes, as there are vehicles with better mobility characteristics, and in many cases you'll encounter a vehicle before reaching a desirable position.

{{main|2A28 (73 mm)}}

The 2A28 main cannon, despite being the 'main' armament will more often than not act more as secondary armament, at least once the BMP-1P upgrade is researched, due to the 9M113 ATGM proving significantly more controllable and effective at all engagement ranges.

Despite this, the PG-9 HEAT round proves valuable in a pinch, with well-placed shots able to disable critical components on most vehicles the {{PAGENAME}} will face. Keep in mind that the {{PAGENAME}} does not feature any sort of stabilisation at all, and due to its chassis the gun is near impossible to get on target when braking or going cross-country at full speed.

The main cannon's primary drawback is its mediocre ballistic performance, with the HEAT round travelling at only 665 m/s and the HE round travelling at a 290 m/s. The projectiles, however, do not have shell falloff until 3km away and can be aimed using gun scope adjustment. BMP-1 does not have a rangefinder, so it is only reasonable to use HE shell in AB, and the HEAT will be difficult to aim past 900 m in RB. As such, the projectile drop is not the worst in-game.

HE shell is near useless at the BR range, and is extremely difficult to aim in RB. It still does have one very specific use - to attack open topped ATGM tanks without going at them, so at least two can be taken in AB just in case.

At least some care should be taken when firing the HEAT round as it has relatively poor slope characteristics, with the penetration dropping to just 150 mm if it hits an armour plate with more than 60 degrees of slope, which is not a problem at long range, but can become an issue when facing top superheavy tanks head-on, and you happened to run out of ATGM.

{{main|9M14|9M113 Konkurs}}

The BMP-1 can use two different ATGMs which are mounted differently and have entirely different playstyles tied to them. Either missile reloads 8 seconds which is one of the fastest (beats most ATGM tanks by at least 2 seconds, other IFV by at least 4), if not the fastest, ATGM reload. Both missiles have poor turn rate at close range.

'''9M14'''
[[File:Unupgraded bmp1 kills it1 camp squad.jpg|thumb|right|An extreme example of 9M14 use in AB against technically superior ATGM tank. May or may not work in RB.]]
The {{PAGENAME}} comes with a rail-mounted manually-guided ATGM as stock, initially aimed manually, disabling tank movements, and has somewhat mediocre penetration and explosive mass values. While occasionally useful, generally the main gun is easier and more reliable to use. It also has very low starting speed of about 70 m/s.

In AB, it can pointed with a mouse and will not disable tank's movement. It also can be semi-reliably launched over cover, since it is launched upwards. By pointing a targeting reticle at a tank 200 m away behind a wall or a hill before launch, you are likely to hit them directly, however, sometimes it flinches.

- Guidance type: MCLOS
- Firing range: 3 km

'''9M113'''

Once the BMP-1P upgrade is researched, the rail-mounted 9M14 ATGM is replaced with a spindle-mounted 9M113 ATGM. This ATGM is significantly more powerful and easier to use due to its semi-automatic guiding system. It is launched straight and has maximum velocity from the get go.

Another reason to give up the first-gen missile is the smoke grenades which come with 9M113 and are extremely useful with directly launched ATGMs.

Improved penetration values and significantly increased explosive mass will result in far more reliable destructive power. Keep in mind that the ATGM still can only be fired when stopped or at extremely low speeds.

Be aware, that the new missile launcher is put above the top of a turret and is a liability, since it is very visible even when the tank hides behind a wall and is a valid target for hostiles. A single ATGM hit to the launcher will obliterate the BMP, and so will HE.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}}'s limitations as a light tank hinders its ability to directly fight enemy vehicles, it will not survive any punishment sent its way. It needs to play with cover and concealment frequently, as any vehicle with a heavy machine gun, be it ground or air, can quite easily shred the {{PAGENAME}} apart if a round hits the left side or roof armour. Considering one of the common enemy nation of the {{PAGENAME}} in RB is the USA, which has a habit of putting a heavy machine gun on any tank, means that the {{PAGENAME}} needs to be extremely careful and aware of their surroundings before moving up, lest it gets torn apart by a barrage of bullets. In AB, the biggest threat to it is its own brethren, as fighting other BMPs is very difficult and relies on difference in your skills a lot (or, at least, on ability to press "aim assist" and "fire" faster).

However, the {{PAGENAME}}'s traits in mobility and firepower makes the vehicle a good scout and ambush vehicle.

; Scouting

The {{PAGENAME}} in War Thunder can't serve as an IFV as it is in real life due to the lack of infantry, but it does have the ability to active scout. This role makes the {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility an important factor of the vehicle's success, as getting to places that the enemy is not aware of to scout out can mean a lot to the team's successes. Even in the active scouting's cooldown period, do not be afraid to communicate to the team where the enemy is with the map and chat function.

In this role, the {{PAGENAME}} should avoid contact with the enemy. Utilise useful camouflage and whatever cover is available to make sure the enemy cannot see the {{PAGENAME}} at a first glance (or without switching to any available special optics like thermals). One can also use the amphibious nature of the {{PAGENAME}} to get into areas through paths that the enemy would not expect. Although this role may mean the {{PAGENAME}} is not as active in destroying the enemy, it is an important role for the team overall that the scout continues to observe the enemy so that battlefield information is kept up to date.

The {{PAGENAME}} of course may be spotted during this endeavour, and so an exit strategy should be maintained. Should an enemy round start flying around the {{PAGENAME}}'s direction, or an enemy was observed trying to move onto the {{PAGENAME}}'s position, begin exfiltrating. Utilise smoke for concealment (default with the ESS, but smoke grenades are available with the BMP-1P modification upgrade) if needed.

; Ambushing

Though the {{PAGENAME}} is not good standing up against enemy tanks, the {{PAGENAME}} still has the necessary firepower to deal with most. The 73 mm has decent amount of penetration for a hit, but the low muzzle velocity is detrimental for long-range targets (although, it can be utilised for a parabolic firing arc against enemies beyond hills). The key weapon on the {{PAGENAME}} is the four ATGM mounted on the turret, with either the manual 9M14 or the semi-active 9M113 missile (the latter with the BMP-1P upgrade) as options. Although both have better penetration values than the 73 mm cannon, the 9M113 missile with the BMP-1P upgrade is a much better candidate for this role due to the increased missile velocity and lethality.

Moving around the flanks, the {{PAGENAME}} should try to find a nice, open field of fire against common enemy paths. Try to establish the {{PAGENAME}} around objectives so as teammates fire upon the enemy and force them to take cover, the {{PAGENAME}} can manoeuvre to an ideal angle and hit the enemy thinking they are in cover. The ideal manner of firing on the enemy is, if the target is less than 500 m, to engage first with the 73 mm cannon. If this does not destroy nor critically damage the enemy to disable their movement or firepower, then follow up with a missile into the hull. If the target is at farther ranges, engage first with the missile to ensure the first shot hits the target. Be wary of longer engagements as there are only 4 missiles onboard the {{PAGENAME}}, and more shots will mean the enemy have a better idea of the {{PAGENAME}}'s position.

If ambushing from the sides of an enemy's attack direction is not ideal to the map, a "shoot-and-scoot" tactic of hiding behind cover and exposing the {{PAGENAME}} only long enough to fire a missile or shot can be sufficient too in dealing with the enemy. However, beware of exposing the {{PAGENAME}} by manner of going over hills, as the turret's gun depression is only -4 degrees (-5 degree for the 9M113 missile launcher) and doing so will expose a large portion of the {{PAGENAME}}'s hull to the enemy.

Should the {{PAGENAME}}'s position become compromised, dump smoke and exfiltrate the area.

; Night-fighting

[[File:BMP-1 InfraredSpotlight.jpg|right|x250px|thumb|The BMP-1's with the fixed hull-mounted IR spotlight on in NVD mode. One can observe that the spotlight does not follow the turret.]]

Either of the role above can still be performed at night, but one must utilise the tools available in the {{PAGENAME}} to make the most of the environment.

The {{PAGENAME}} can research the Night Vision Device (NVD) modification, which can help during night battles to help with visibility. NVD is available in commander, gunner, driver and outside view ports. Utilising the NVD can brighten up a hazy horizon due to the night.

Another tool with the NVD modification is an infrared spotlight, which can help illuminate targets if they are hard to see even with the NVD. However, the spotlight is fixed to the hull and does not move with the gun, requiring alignment of the hull towards the target requiring illumination. The infrared spotlight, when on, also marks the {{PAGENAME}} with a giant light that any enemy with the same NVD can spot easily. As such, usage of the infrared spotlight should be minimised, with total reliance on the base NVD by itself or only periodically switching on the spotlight and quickly turning it off once a picture of the battlefield is obtained.

; Fighting people which are aware of BMP-1 position

There are two ways in which you can defeat opponents straight up charging at your position: by corner camping and by abusing scouting.

Corner camping is simple as long as you have both weapons loaded - you take such a position, that does not allow an enemy to fire at {{PAGENAME}} until you shot their front with a gun (which almost guarantees that their driver is gone and causes the tank to continue moving forward and also eventually stop) and "double tap" them for a good measure with an ATGM to the exposed side, destroying the rest of the crew. Usually, even if an enemy tank somehow survives, you can reload faster than their crew replaces the gunner or the driver. Do note, that camping behind destructible cover is a bad idea, since kinetic shells can penetrate them, and your chemical shells cannot.

Against other missile tanks this tactic is a double edged sword. Make sure to hide ATGM launcher from missile tanks, as otherwise they might just fire at it and destroy you. If you see a vertical ATGM tank charging directly at you, that generally means its user knows how to fire over obstacles and the tactic will not work if you don't have a tall wall. Even if you do have a tall wall, some double launcher ATGMs can go as far as straight up demolishing the building you are hiding behind just to get to you.

Using scouting is more difficult and is more fit for the arcade mode - use scouting on enemy tank and fire smoke screens to break direct vision, aim assist and marking, then roll out and fire ATGM in direction the enemy tank is supposed to be in. This is unlikely to work against other light tanks, because they might just spam scouting at everything they see, including you, naturally countering the tactic.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Fairly mobile and thus very good at flanking
- Both weapon systems are particularly effective against lightly armoured vehicles, like the [[Leopard I]], [[OF-40]], etc.
- Has a below 4-second reload if it chain fires both weapons
- One of the earliest ATGM vehicles available and the earliest to receive mouse-guided (SACLOS) ATGMs (with the BMP-1P modification)
- Decent 73 mm HEAT penetrating up to 300 mm of armour, effective against last-gen heavy tanks like the [[Conqueror]], [[M103]], etc.
- Amphibious ability allows it to reach positions that other vehicles struggle to
- Functional even in uptiers, due to its piercing ATGM and HEAT
- Night Vision allows effectiveness in night battles
- Unless it is hit straight in the turret compartment there is always a chance that it somehow survives

'''Cons:'''

- Mediocre reverse speed for a light tank, limiting its tactical agility
- Default missiles are manually guided in RB, can be challenging to use
- Poor survivability due to thin armour, minimal crew number and large size
- You can't use the smoke grenades together with the original missiles
- Only has chemical ammunition, struggles to damage vehicles with ERA like [[M60A1 RISE (P)]] or [[Centurion Mk.5 AVRE]], can't fire through light obstacles like fences or bushes, buildings
- Minimal -4° gun depression makes it struggle in hills
- Has no stabiliser, a disadvantage against stabilised/stationary tanks like [[FV4202]]
- Infrared Spotlight mounted to hull, won't rotate with turret when NVD is on
- Can carry only 4 ATGMs

'''Development'''

In the 1950s, Soviet armoured personnel carrier (APC) tactics consisted of lightly armoured vehicles that would transport soldiers to combat zones, and then head back behind the lines to safety. During this time, the West German Bundeswehr was using the Schützenpanzer Lang and infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) tactics, where the vehicles would work with the infantry and tanks in order to support them, especially against lightly armoured targets. The BMP was a Soviet IFV design created in the late 1950's. Some of the requirements were the ability for all of the infantry carried to be able to fire from within the vehicle, which was unseen before in IFV designs. It was intended to support the infantry and combat enemy light vehicles. The design placed emphasis on speed and manoeuvrability, potent armament, and sufficient armament to protect against 23 mm autocannons over the frontal arc. There was a debate over how the vehicle should be wheeled or tracked, and a number of options were explored including hybrid designs with both. The design that was chosen was a tracked vehicle with the engine in the front and the crew compartment in the rear; it was designated the Object 764. A prototype was created in 1964, and the final design was chosen in 1965 - an improved model called the Object 765. In service the production model was called the BMP-1.

'''Design'''

The BMP-1 features a fully tracked hull, with a sharply angled glacis at the front, a centrally mounted turret, and a crew compartment in the rear of the hull, with doors for the infantry to mount and dismount the vehicle. The hull layout is as follows: the engine was in the front right section of the hull. The driver sat to the front left of the vehicle, the commander sat right behind the driver, and the gunner sat in the right side of the turret. The troop compartment located at the rear of the vehicle could seat 8 infantry soldiers. The ability to fire from inside the vehicle was provided by four firing ports on each side of the hull and one in the left door. There are also four hatches in the roof. The infantry sit on two benches with padding, back to back, facing the outer sides of the vehicle. The armour of the frontal arc is enough to generally protect against 20 mm autocannon fire, the side armour generally protects against 12.7 mm machine gun fire, and the roof and rear armour protects against small arms fire and shell fragments. In addition, the sloped glacis on the front of the hull also increased the chances of shells bouncing, because of the extreme angles. The protection level depended somewhat on the version of the BMP-1 in question, as different nations had differing levels of armour quality. The main armament consisted of a 73 mm 2A28 Grom smoothbore semi-automatic cannon, along with a 9M14 Malyutka anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). Secondary armament consisted of a 7.62 mm PKT machine gun. The engine provides 300 hp, and is a six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine. The suspension system used was a torsion bar suspension system. The BMP-1 is fully amphibious with little preparation. Before entering the water a trim vane has to be raised, which provides additional frontal armour when in the lowered position. It can achieve 65 km/h (40 mph) on road and 8 km/h (5 mph) in water.

'''Production and Service'''

Over 20,000 BMP-1's were produced in the Soviet Union alone, with many more produced in China and Czechoslovakia. The BMP-1 was widely exported and saw significant combat worldwide. BMP-1's participated in the Yom Kippur War, the Angolan Civil War, the Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf War, and many other conflicts. It was well liked for its manoeuvrability, but it was found that the cannon lacked effective range and the 9M14 ATGMs were hard to control. During the Gulf War it was found that the 25 mm Bushmaster cannon found on the M2/M3 Bradley could consistently penetrate the frontal armour of the BMP-1, even at range.

'''BMP-1P Upgrade'''

The BMP-1P was an upgrade to the ATGM systems of the BMP-1. It replaced the 9M14 Malyutka missiles with 9M113 Konkurs or 9M111 missile. This increased the weight of the vehicle, leading to a slight decrease in manoeuvrability.
