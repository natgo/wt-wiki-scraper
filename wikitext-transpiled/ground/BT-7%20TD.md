== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Soviet light tank, developed from the previous BT-5 light tank. Both designs shared the same 45 mm 20-K cannon aswell as coaxial DT machine gun. Unlike the BT-5, the BT-7s hull was welded and the shape of hull at front was also redesigned. The frontal armour protection was slightly increased from 13 to 20 mm of armour. New short-pitch tracks were installed and Mikulin M-17T engine which was a licensed copy of German BMW VI V-12 engine was used instead of the M-5-400 found in BT-5 and earlier BT series tanks. New turret turret featuring sloped armour was also adopted. The BT-7 was used during Winter War and Continuation war with Finland aswell as during the early stages of Operation Barbarossa. Their numbers greatly reduced due to combat losses after 1941, the BTs served for the remainder of war. One example in running condition is preserved to this day.

The BT-7 TD was introduced during [[Update "Hot Tracks"]] as reward for [[wt:en/news/7020-special-twitch-drops-watch-enlisted-streams-and-get-rewards-en|watching Enlisted streams on Twitch.tv]]. The BT-7 TD is identical to the [[BT-7]] in every way except for the exclusive camouflage, of a BT tank during the battle of Moscow, similar to the one found on the [[T-26 (1st Gv.T.Br.)]]. The BT-7 TD features a very powerful gun on a highly mobile chassis, at the cost of no valuable armour. The tank commanders should utilize the speed of the BT to flank their enemies and shoot them from sides and then quickly change position and perform another ambush as the vehicle itself is very lightly armoured and any hit is fatal.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Deadly firepower at its BR: high penetration of up to 70 mm, with the 29 g TNT it can frontally knock out most tanks like [[Pz.II (Family)|Pz.II]], [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Chi-Ha]] or [[M3 Stuart (Family)|M3 Stuart]]; its firepower is effective even in high tier battles, if aiming at the right spot
* One of the fastest tanks in the game, great acceleration and overall mobility makes it a nice point-capper, flanker and climber - can outrun the commonly seen M3 Stuart on road
* 3-4 second reload time is quick enough to destroy opponents it cannot knock out with a single shot, like [[Pz.IV C]] and [[LVT(A)(1)|LVT(A)]] series
* Adequate reverse speed of -10 km/h allows it to quickly retreat from danger when there is no time to turn around
* Small and low profile allows it to easily hide behind cover or bushes
* Winter camouflage comes as the standard camouflage, excellent on winter maps but may cause some issues in other climates

'''Cons:'''

* Poor survivability: non-existent armour on all sides plus the closely packed crew makes it vulnerable to autocannons ([[Pz.II (Family)|Pz.II]], [[Flakpanzer I]]), heavy MG ([[M13 MGMC]]) and even solid shells
* Turret and hull traverse is rather slow, meaning it may not be able to keep track of fast targets- this is also a disadvantage in a close quarters duel, as other light tanks like [[M3 Stuart (Family)|M3 Stuart]] can turn way faster
* Although fast, it is still slower than the [[Sd.Kfz.234 (Family)|Sd.Kfz.234]] series on road.
* Gun depression of only -6 degrees (worse than previous BT-5) means it cannot effectively fight in hills
* Fuel tanks and ammo are scattered inside and are prone to detonation upon being hit
