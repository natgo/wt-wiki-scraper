== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In the post-World War II environment, the Soviet sought to provide their infantry with a method to remain mobile on the battlefield. While armoured units received [[BMP-1|BMPs]] to keep the armoured infantry mobile with the tanks, motorizing rifle divisions required a cheaper, more numerous transport to house all the infantry. The BTR series of armoured cars would first be modernized with the 8x8 wheeled BTR-60 in the 1960s, with updates into the BTR-70 and BTR-80 in their respective decades. The BTR-80 was distinguished from the preceding two variants with the usage of a diesel engine and turret modifications that allowed it to elevate the main armament to a high degree to engage in mountainous terrain or urban areas. The BTR-80 would receive an update in the 1990s that added the 30 mm 2A72 autocannon as its main armament in a new turret designated BPPU.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]], follows the trend of a light tank with an autocannon armament that can shred apart medium tanks in ambushes. Unlike its contemporaries like the [[Wiesel 1A4]], the BTR-80A is a rather large vehicle, quite similar to the BMPs. Not to mention the wheeled design can interfere with cross-country mobility so that finding a good place to hide outside of urban terrain can be difficult. As such, finding a suitable hiding place to ambush the enemies with the autocannon can be complicated by the BTR-80A's size and wheeled performance. That said, the 30 mm 2A72 autocannon that is found on the [[BMP-3]] packs a much higher punch with its APDS rounds. This allows the BTR-80A the ability to attack more enemies from a farther away distance with the 30 mm and should be exploited by watching common enemy travel routes from a distance to riddle their side armour to shreds.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
While quite large and somewhat heavier than most other light IFVs such as the Wiesel, the BTR-80A boasts a very high top speed of 87 km/h which can be reached quite quickly on roads and trails. The downside of the 8 wheel design is its poor off-road mobility, however it is still quite nimble even on rough ground. It is very common to see BTR-80s rushing caps due to their high speed; they can capture points quite safely and then reposition to either scout or ambush enemy light/medium armour.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Effective 2A72 30 mm autocannon, the same one used on the BMP-3 and BMD-4
** APDS is great for fighting against light vehicles and MBTs' sides
* Fairly mobile and thus very good at flanking
* Amphibious

'''Cons:'''

* Huge profile
* Poor survivability due to thin armour, minimal crew number and large size
* -5° gun depression and slow gun handling
* Has no stabiliser
* Relatively low power-to-weight ratio
* Can be destroyed by most heavy machine guns

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The BTR-80 armored personnel carrier was developed with experience from using the previous vehicles of the series, BTR-60 and BTR-70, in peacetime and combat operations of the Afghan war. The vehicle received a new 260 hp engine, reinforced armor, improved fire ports for the small arms of the troops inside, as well as other improvements. The main gun of the BTR-80 remained a heavy machine gun, however, due to the low efficiency of machine gun fire against modern lightly armored targets, an improved version of the vehicle with a 30mm 2A72 autocannon appeared in 1993, designated as BTR-80A. Vehicles of the BTR-80 family took part in all major armed conflicts in the territory of the former USSR and a number of other countries. Despite the commissioning of more advanced APCs, the BTR-80A is still in service with the Russian Army to this day.
