== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 "Vive la France"]].

At first glance, the Begleitpanzer 57 may be confused for a SPAA due to the light armoured chassis and the rapid-firing 57 mm autocannon. On the turret is also a TOW launcher with SACLOS guidance, meaning it will automatically align itself with where the crosshair is pointing.

As it shares the same chassis, the Begleitpanzer 57's construction is similar to that of the [[Marder A1-]], with light armour all around and sides that heavy machine guns can penetrate. The main cannon's exterior mounting also means it can be disabled by machine guns and shrapnel.

As a light tank, the Begleitpanzer 57 carries great firepower and high mobility. The 57 mm autocannon has a penetration power close to that of the [[ZSU-57-2]]'s, but the addition of a TOW launcher system makes this vehicle able to engage heavier targets.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 2 and 3 are first stage ammo racks. They total 48 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with mechanized magazines, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
* Once racks 2 and 3 have been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the mechanized magazines. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 into rack 3 then 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
* The depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 3 - 1.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Begleitpanzer 57 is a very capable light tank and support vehicle. With proximity fuse HE shells in its 57 mm cannon, it can effectively engage air targets, and can destroy enemy IFVs and even MBTs with its high-penetration rounds. However, when shooting at enemy planes, it is best to wait until they are close before firing, since the vehicle does not have a very high ammo count. Alternatively, the vehicle carries missiles which can be used very effectively to destroy both helicopters and tanks at long ranges. The missile's travel time must be taken in to consideration, but it is nice to have when the enemy is too far away to engage with the 57 mm cannon.

The Begleitpanzer's main cannon can sometimes destroy MBTs from the front, but does damage much more consistently when shooting the enemy's weaker armoured side. For this reason, it is often wise to adopt an ambushing or flanking playstyle. This is helped by the vehicle's small profile and good mobility. It is easy to reach good firing positions and manoeuvre around the enemy quickly and without being seen. (And since the vehicle has poor armour, avoiding being seen will be very important for survival).

While the cannon shares its calibre with the Soviet [[S-68 (57 mm)|57 mm S-68 cannon]], it is quite different in performance with a slower rate of fire and a lesser accuracy. The penetration power is considerably inferior compared to the APCBC belt of the S-68 at 1 km distance.  The HE round can be completely ignored as it can not reliably go through the side armour of most MBTs it faces. All of this means that long range firepower relies mainly on your ATGM, of which you only have 6. Upgrading to the better ATGM is highly encouraged due to its increased penetration.

At the end of the day, the Begleitpanzer can be played as a light tank scout. It can't engage the enemy front-on, but it can be a valuable asset to the team and is lethal when played in the correct positions. Be sure to use the scouting ability to help friendly players locate enemy tanks. During night battles, the NVD modification will make scouting both easier to do and even more helpful to the team.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Effective against tanks and aircraft/helicopters
* Has ability to utilise scouting mechanic
* Lethal when shooting enemies from the side
* 1st generation gunner thermals
* Proximity HE shells are very good against helicopters (proxy fuse is only active after 500 m)
* Has access to a laser rangefinder

'''Cons:'''

* Limited gun elevation (45°) to deal with enemy planes
* Cannot destroy many enemies frontally
* Fairly low ammunition count
* Gun breech is easily destroyed
* Must stop to fire AGTMs
* Loses accuracy when firing continuously

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== [[wt:en/news/5069-development-begleitpanzer-57-bofors-marder-united-at-last-en|Devblog]] ===
The armoured fire-support vehicle Begleitpanzer 57 is a combined project from the Thyssen-Henschel and Bofors companies, developed for scouting and destroying lightly armoured Soviet APCs and IFVs without needing tank divisions for support. To achieve this, the engineers chose the chassis of the German Marder infantry fighting vehicle and installed an adapted version of an automatic 57mm ship cannon on it. Moreover, for fighting with enemy tanks, the Begleitpanzer was equipped with American TOW guided anti-tank rockets and a reloading system for the rocket launcher was developed and placed inside the vehicle's hull.

The result was a fast and light infantry fighting machine capable of destroying enemy tanks and armoured personnel carriers at impressive ranges. At the same time, it could also land a small group of 3 infantry scouts. Sounds like a great idea! But it was the very universality of the Begleitpanzer 57 that prevented the vehicle from going into series production. The Begleitpanzer 57 turned out to be too lightly armoured for an infantry fighting machine, and too heavily armoured for a scout tank, plus it was not adapted for overcoming significant water obstacles. The military commission rejected the experimental prototype and the project was closed.
