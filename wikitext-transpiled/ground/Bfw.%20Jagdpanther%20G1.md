== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29_Sd.Kfz._Index|Sd.Kfz. Index:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 173''') is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before [[Update 1.41]].

The {{PAGENAME}} is a command variant of the [[Jagdpanther]], intended to be crewed by the battalion headquarters personnel to command a Jagdpanther company. The {{PAGENAME}} received a Fu 5 transmitter and a Fu 2 receiver radio. These changes, along with cosmetics, do not affect the vehicle in the game and the {{PAGENAME}} is otherwise the same specification-wise as the standard Jagdpanther.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The '''Jagdpanther''' is best used defensively, to cover capture points and prevent their capture, and to cover friendly tank advances. It's highly recommended to hide the lower frontal plate in this tank, as it has a frontal mounted transmission which will set on fire if shot. It is also strongly advised to use this tank to engage at long range, and to change position often.

It is important to keep in mind that the Jagdpanther's armour is sloped. Using it on the side of a hill facing the enemy is extremely dangerous since this would decrease the angle at which the frontal armour is sloped relative to incoming fire and thus negate a large part of the vehicle's defensive capabilities. By hiding behind buildings, trees and bushes, or behind a ridgeline, its fighting capability is optimised. A well positioned Jagdpanther is very hard to destroy. In addition, using the Jagdpanther in a diamond position (with its right side facing the enemy) will mean that your most important crew members are better protected (driver, gunner, commander) since they are all on the left side of the vehicle.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

* [[IS-2]], [[ISU-122]], [[SU-152]]/[[ISU-152]]: The Jagdpanther relies on its frontal armour a lot to survive, so the biggest threats are generally the vehicles with high penetration. These machines with high calibre guns pose the biggest threat, as their APCBC shells will slice through the Jagdpanther's frontal armour like butter, and their damage is more than enough to kill all the crew inside. Try and finish them off first before they see you. If they do, quickly go to a nearby cover and either call for help, or wait until they fire/are distracted.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Armed with the legendary long 88 mm KwK43. One of the best pound-for-pound guns in the game thanks to the great accuracy, penetration, damage potential, and rate of fire
* Unlike other tanks, the gun's default APCBC shell is the best shell to use. It has great accuracy, velocity, penetration, and damage potential at all ranges
* 5x Sight sufficient for most engagements
* Really good top speed and manoeuvrability. Makes getting into a strong early game position a breeze
* The tank is based off the Panther chassis, meaning the frontal armour is really strong against guns packing less than 200 mm of penetration
* Carries an amazing amount of smoke grenades
* Despite not having a turret, the tank still has good gun depression

'''Cons:'''

* Bad reverse speed might get the player killed
* Panther hull armour isn't as effective against enemies it would face, rounds like the APDS from the 20-pdr or [[IS-2 (Family)|IS-2]]'s BR-471 APHE can easily penetrate
* Front-mounted transmission can catch fire and immobilises vehicle when shot through lower frontal plate
* Like most tank destroyers it lacks a turret, limiting its ability to respond to flankers like [[M18 GMC]]
* A lot bigger than previous tank destroyers, so may need to get used to the size and how to conceal it
* Penetration from the sides is often lethal as sides are littered with ammunition#

===Development===
The formidable 8.8 cm Pak43 anti-tank gun was created as a longer version of the 8.8 cm KwK36. Two attempts were made to fit this gun onto a self-propelled chassis, the first was the[[Ferdinand|Panzerjäger Tiger (P) Ferdinand]] (later Elefant) and the second was the [[Nashorn]]. However, the Ferdinand was too heavy and unreliable while the Nashorn chassis was too small and underpowered to propel such a gun. The '''Jagdpanther''' was proposed in late 1942, as a tank destroyer mounting the formidable 8.8 cm Pak43, built on the [[Panther D|Panther]] chassis with good armour and speed. The tank destroyer was created and designated '''SdKfz 173''' and was demonstrated to Hitler on October 1943. Production then started in January 1944 under the simpler name '''Jagdpanther''', which Hitler preferred over the longer '''8.8 cm Pak43/3 auf Panzerjäger Panther'''.

Throughout its production life of January 1944 to 1945, a total 415 of these vehicles were made. MIAG produced 270 from January 1944 to the end of the war, MNH produced 112 from November 1944, and MBA produced 37 from December 1944. The supposed goal was 150 Jagdpanthers produced per month, but Germany's deteriorating situation made this impossible. The Jagdpanthers were made in two variants, '''G1''' and '''G2'''. The G1 had a small internally bolted main gun and modified Panther Ausf. An engine deck while the G2 had a larger simplified, outer bolted mantlet with a modified Panther Ausf. G engine deck. A proposal to mount the 12.8 cm Pa 80 was considered but never produced.

The Jagdpanther was a rather good design as a tank destroyer. It had a good power-to-weight ratio and had a gun that could penetrate any allied tank in service during the war. It did not suffer from as many reliability problems due to it's basis on the later [[Panther G|Panther Ausf. G]] model, which had fixed most of the Panther's initial problems. It also used an improved transmission and final drive (the two sources of most Panther issues), which were planned for the Panther II.

===Command variant===
Jagdpanthers were assigned to heavy tank destroyer battalions in the Western Front and Eastern Front, but they required a vehicle to house the commander of each battalion. So during the Jagdpanther's production, a command vehicle variant was also made from the Jagdpanther. These vehicles are distinguishable from regular-issue Jagdpanthers with the presence of more antennas to house the FuG8 30W radio that allows communication between the command tank and headquarters. Each battalion would have access to two '''Befehlswagen Jagdpanther''' for use to coordinate the battalion, other units in each battalion is 14 normal Jagdpanthers, 5 Bergepanthers for armour recovery, a repair company, two anti-aircraft platoons, a combat engineer platoon, and an armoured reconnaissance platoon

To equip the commanders of tank destroyer battalions, in the summer of 1944 production of a command vehicle based on the Jagdpanther tank destroyer was launched.

These command vehicles were equipped with a FuG8 30W radio station with ranges of 10 km (phone) and 50-80 km (Morse key). The transmitter operated on a medium frequency range, from 1,130 to 3,000 kHz. The receiver operated in the 835-3,000 kHz range.

The FuG5 radio station was equipped with a whip antenna with a height of 2 m, and the FuG8 radio, with a Sternantenne antenna with a height of 1.4 m.

These vehicles served in detached anti-tank battalions. The organization of these battalions was established by the KStN 1149c government schedule, issued on March 1, 1944. A company consisted of 14 vehicles, and two more Panzerbefehlswagen Jagdpanthers were driven by the company's command staff. Each battalion had 3 companies. An additional maintenance company had 5 Bergepanthers. In addition, each battalion had a repair company, two anti-aircraft defense platoons, a combat engineer platoon, and a reconnaissance armoured transport platoon. The command staff of the battalion had two command Jagdpanthers equipped with additional radio stations.
