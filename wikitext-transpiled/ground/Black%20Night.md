== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''FV4034 Challenger 2 (Black Night)''' is a technology demonstrator for BAE Systems' proposal for the [[Challenger 2]] life extension project (LEP), intended to provide a series of modernisations that would extend the service life of the Challenger 2 MBT until 2035. The Black Night has several new enhancements, mainly around the turret, including a Safran Paseo commander's independent sight, a Leonardo thermal imager for the gunner, and a Leonardo night sight DNVS 4 to provide hunter-killer capabilities thanks to thermal imaging equipment for the gunner, commander, and driver. Other additions included a laser warning system and the IMI Iron First hard-kill active protection system. BAE Systems first showcased the Black Night at the Defense Vehicle Dynamics expo in September 2018. However, it was quickly superseded by the Rheinmetall proposal, featuring a completely redesigned turret and smoothbore gun. The Challenger 2 LEP itself has resulted in the development of the Challenger 3, a major upgrade of the platform undertaken in a joint venture by BAE and Rheinmetall to be in operation by 2030.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Black Night is a technology demonstrating modification of the [[Challenger 2|standard Challenger 2]] designed to counter the widespread use of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) on modern battlefields. Thanks to cutting-edge technologies such as the well-known Iron Fist active protection system (APS), players can lead assaults into modern battlefields without fear of ATGMs from both ground vehicles and helicopters. The Black Night is a one-of-a-kind and exclusive Challenger 2 modification that provides superior protection against ATGMs. However, players should keep in mind that the Iron Fist APS does not provide limitless protection and hence the vehicle should not stay out in the open for long during combat.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In summary, the Black Night plays in a similar way to the base Challenger 2. This is due to having the same armour configuration, without the option of add-on armour. Where the Black Night differs however is the active protection system. This APS will protect the vehicle well not only from ground launched missiles, but also from air launched missiles provided they are not above the systems maximum elevation.

The Black Night will perform best as a sniper or support tank. With the modern thermal systems and laser rangefinder, locating and ranging at long distance is precise. As with the other Challengers, playing hull down is ideal.

Where playing at range is not an option, such as urban maps, care should be taken to cover the hull as much as possible. Covering the hull can be achieved by using other vehicles or terrain. Where there is no cover available, the Black Night is best played slowly, taking time to ensure locations are clear before pushing into them.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has a highly effective APS (Active Protection System) which can defend against ATGMs and sometimes can even snipe HE shell at point blank range
* It has 20 smoke grenades with 5 salvos, smokes fire in a 360 degree pattern, protecting the entire tank from all directions
* The Black Night has modern thermal systems equipped in the gunner view and commander view with a high resolution
* It comes equipped with a laser warning system which can give an idea of where an enemy might be attacking from
* Retains other Pros from base Challenger 2

'''Cons:'''

* Retains weaknesses of the base Challenger 2
** Large weak spots in armour and poor placement of ammo and charges in the tank limit the survivability
** Does not have ERA of the 2F model, so can be defeated by basic HEAT-FS sometimes
** The engine is rather weak leading to poor acceleration and mobility despite not having too much of excessive weight
** Same shell options as the previous Challengers 2 at a higher BR
* Although APS is very powerful, it runs out of ammunition very quickly, cannot sustain against modern SAM/ATGM carriers and sometimes reacts to near unhittable things like APFSDS, which can be good or bad
* Only 2 x rifle-calibre machine guns

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Black Night demonstrator was BAE System's bid for the Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme contract, prior to the forming of the Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) joint venture company in July 2019.

The Black Night was fully unveiled in October 2018 and showed a focus on improving the technology of the vehicle, with a Safran PASEO panoramic Commander Primary Sight, a generation 3 Leonardo thermal imaging system (still mounted in the housing above the main gun), a laser warning system, the Iron Fist Hardkill Active Protection System, regenerative braking in the turret ring, and a new fire control system. The armour and firepower were retained from the base Challenger 2, as was the powerpack.

Rheinmetall's proposal was revealed in January 2019, featuring the Rh 120 mm L/55 gun (L55A1 in British use) and a completely new turret. When RBSL was formed, an internal decision was made in favour of Rheinmetall's design, which was seen again at DSEI 2019, putting the Black Night proposal to rest. The MoD confirmed the signing of a £800M (~$1.1B at the time) contract with RBSL for Challenger 3 using Rheinmetall's design on 7th May 2021.
