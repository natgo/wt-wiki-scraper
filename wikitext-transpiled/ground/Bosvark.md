== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Bosvark''' is a self-propelled anti-aircraft (SPAA) vehicle named after the African Bushpig, which is armed with powerful tusks for digging up roots and defending itself against predators. The South African Defence Force (SADF) seized considerable amounts of 23 mm ZU-23-2 twin-barrelled autocannons from the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) during the South African Border War, which lasted from 1966 to 1989. The MPLA had obtained these from Cuban and Soviet benefactors. The SADF employed these weapons for a variety of purposes, including base defence, makeshift weapons platforms, and training. Early in 1990, the Armaments Corporation of South Africa (ARMSCOR) issued a request for proposals based on end-user specifications established by the SADF to mount the captured 23 mm ZU-23-2 twin-barrelled autocannons (also known as GA-6 in the SADF) on a vehicle. The vehicle had to be mine-resistant, according to the key development criteria. The SAMIL 100 Kwêvol transport vehicle was chosen as it met the specifications for an armoured crew compartment, a mine-protected chassis, and a large rear deck on which to put the weapon platform.

Introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]], the Bosvark is fast and manoeuvrable, players can easily set up ambushes by hiding near buildings and waiting for unsuspecting enemy aircraft to fly low, making them an easy target. It is, however, larger than other SPAA vehicles, and many of its personnel are unprotected. As a result, it is critical to always remain hidden and unnoticed. A quick burst of fire from the 23 mm ZU-23-2 twin-barrelled autocannons can readily bring down any aircraft during battles. However, as the ammunition is limited and the reload time is long, it is crucial not to fire for an extended period. Finally, do not engage enemy ground forces. Despite having access to armour-piercing ammunition belts, the armour penetration capability is insufficient to deal with the vast majority of targets encountered during fights.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast vehicle, capable to relocate as needed thanks to superior top speed
* Powerful fast firing 23 mm cannons; small bursts are often enough
* Numerous crew members; may survive longer

'''Cons:'''

* Large vehicle; difficult to conceal and manoeuvre in enclosed areas due to large turning radius
* Lightly armoured; explosives, machine guns, rockets and cannons are a threat
* Cannon depletes magazine capacity quickly (50 rounds per gun); precision and restraint are needed
* Wheeled configuration provides poor off-road mobility, speed will not be any advantage
