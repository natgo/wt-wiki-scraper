<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}.  It was introduced during [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XIII, "Tropical Storm"]].

Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turret rotation speed
* Practically no armour

== History ==<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== Devblog History ===
Italian company “Ansaldo de Gênes Sampierdarena” began to develop a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun on a wheeled chassis in 1940, which paved the way to mount a 90 mm gun on a truck, with the arrangement allowing for the cannon to direct fire at enemy ground targets. The Breda 51 Coloniale (6x4) army truck was chosen as the main vehicle of choice, and after modifications were made, the official designation of Breda 52 was given. Production of this new vehicle commenced even before the testing phase had even finished in May 1941. By May 1943 a total of 120 of these vehicles were delivered to the Italian Army. The Breda 52 with the Cannone da 90/53 gun was used in battle in North Africa and also to defend Italy from the Allied invasion.
