== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}.  It was introduced during [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XIII, "Tropical Storm"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Breda's main 90 mm gun and its 4 operators (3 loaders, 1 gunner) are protected by a 7 mm gun shield comparable to that of the German [[8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl.]] or the [[Breda 501]], while the driver and commander sit in a cabin made of 5 mm thick steel. The gun and its 4 operators are exposed from the sides and the back, while the gunner and a loader can be shot at through the front from the gunner's sight. Four 10 mm wheels and a 30 mm metal hull piece protect the transmission directly under the gun. Ammo is stored in a small, not very visible 5 mm structural steel box behind the cabin.

This lack of adequate armour makes you a prime target for any vehicle with a machine gun, high explosive round or artillery strike. Especially one with a common [[M2 Browning (12.7 mm)|M2 browning machine gun]] as it is able to pierce all of your armour and modules. Making sure to only expose the main Gun while engaging targets can ensure relative safety as the intact driver and commander can drive into cover to switch places with the gunner and also repair as the barrel, breech or humongous aiming drive will most likely be damaged. This is not a fool proof strategy though as enemies can hit your transmission, crippling your mobility. Pointing your cabin at the enemy is not advised as most ordnance will hit the exposed engine, radiator, and driver, leaving you unable to escape while allowing the enemy to reload and flank you to get at the rest of your crew and modules.

All in all, the Breda 90/53 relies on its manoeuvrability and range for survivability as it lacks any armour able to stop more than a machine gun round, therefore positioning the vehicle behind solid terrain or map cover will give you the best survivability.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (Turret front)
* Structural steel (Cabin, rear hull, platform, aiming drive, ammo storage)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The truck is moderately fast, driving at 30 km/h on demand and then accelerating towards maximum speed (very slowly in RB), though light tanks will generally drive faster than it. Due to it being wheeled, it will drive faster on roads (quickly reaching 56 km/h), but will also be unable to turn in place.

The truck does not have much climbing power, to get onto some hills it needs a head start (about 70-100 m), but it still can get onto sniping spots and can easily slide off them when threatened for the same reason.

The truck dislikes turning in general, but in a way that is more or less controllable, rather than sliding around at any inconvenience. When braking, the track will turn towards the last wheel turning direction (if user presses "turn right" for a moment and then brake, the truck will do a 90 degree flip to the right, same applies to the "turn left"). The extreme turn strategy can be used if the gun was already turned broadside, though under normal circumstances hard braking when encountering enemies is highly detrimental - simply let go of gas to retain control of the chassis and reduce gun wobble, then turn a bit if the enemy is too close.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

The gun is the same as the one used by the [[90/53 M41M]], that being said, it will penetrate pretty much any tank and turn them into a wreck. To deal with other artillery trucks or planes HE can be used, whether normal ones or the timed variety (In RB and SB, if rangefinder was used before firing, they explode after flying for a set distance, in AB it does nothing special), depending on user preference.

Due to the SPG having a "rangefinder" modification it will have true aim assist across entire maps in AB, and will precisely and fast tell the range in RB at up to about 1.5 km range. This allows to lay waste on the majority of enemy tanks, as most people at the rank have no idea how to aim that far, or will really struggle to land a counter hit even if they do know.

The ammunition is located in the middle of the truck right behind the cab. There is no real reason to not take full ammunition load.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

; Arcade battles

This truck has similar playstyle to all artillery trucks, meaning that in general you want to find some faraway point and shoot people that try to get onto capture points or to shoot you (which they should never be able to do, unless you get distracted in real life). If you get bombed, try to drive away anyway with your forward gear, as in AB bombs are quite small and not many people bomb from optimal altitude of 1.8 km, letting you escape even if you didn't notice them falling. Some problems may arise if random howitzer tank decides to fire at you mortar style with HE or HEAT shells (meaning you will most likely die on their first shot due to it literally falling from space), but this is very rare and majority of enemy SPG are very predictable and will just try to fire over a hill. if you see someone preparing for such a sneak attack, you need to proactively remove the threat - aim at the top of their roof with the help of binoculars and blow them up first.

When there is no faraway sniping point, or you find it boring, or some heavy assistance is required at close range, look for a flat plain (pushing into a hill is a big no-no due to a poor gun depression, unless it is really necessary to win) or a road, then slowly work your way through enemies. Even when fighting at 10 to 800 m range you will have an extreme advantage of being not so easy to defeat with APHE while dishing out instant death with each shot. Try to maximize your control over the area and force one-on-one duels, do not hesitate to drive behind more buildings just to force other opponents to take another turn. Since there are no ammo racks in the back, pushing out with your back to the left is comically efficient, since the enemy will only be able to knock out the loaders, but not the gunner. If your enemy is not absolutely stupid and fires HE to instantly remove you, then you were already dead, though sometimes the HE fails to take out the crew inside the cab, letting you to escape and return again.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Has rangefinder modification, making it extremely potent in any game mode at longer ranges
* Strong armour penetration
* Penetration of enemy targets will most likely result in their destruction
* 30 rounds of ammo compared to the [[90/53 M41M]] with the same cannon
* The ammo rack is not placed on the very back of the truck (unlike with the other truck SPG), so it is less likely to be randomly snapshotted by someone way too familiar with similar vehicles
* Fast reload rate for its calibre
* Completely wheeled, so it can move very fast on roads
* Very potent shell with 347g of explosive filler

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turret rotation speed
* Chassis have a tendency to violently spin when doing a hard brake, it's best to let it naturally slow down when encountering enemies
* Practically no armour
* Only -2 degrees of gun depression
* Forward firing arc is limited by the cabin, needs 300 m range to land a hit against frontal target on same elevation
* Shots to the turret tend to knock out the breech

=== Devblog History ===
Italian company "Ansaldo de Gênes Sampierdarena" began to develop a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun on a wheeled chassis in 1940, which paved the way to mount a 90 mm gun on a truck, with the arrangement allowing for the cannon to direct fire at enemy ground targets. The Breda 51 Coloniale (6x4) army truck was chosen as the main vehicle of choice, and after modifications were made, the official designation of Breda 52 was given. Production of this new vehicle commenced even before the testing phase had even finished in May 1941. By May 1943 a total of 120 of these vehicles were delivered to the Italian Army. The Breda 52 with the Cannone da 90/53 gun was used in battle in North Africa and also to defend Italy from the Allied invasion.
