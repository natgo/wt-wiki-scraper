== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Starfighters"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6808-special-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-2020-en|2020 Operation S.U.M.M.E.R.]] event.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret, gun mantlet, turret ring)
* Composite screen (add-on armour on the hull and the turret)

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

Notes:

* Racks 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 14 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3.
* To go into battle with the frontal ammo racks empty, pack 15&nbsp;''(+40)'' shells.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Deadly gun with excellent APFSDS rounds (408 mm penetration at 10 m, 1,455 m/s), as well as good ammo options available (HEAT, HESH rounds)
* Adequate gun depression/elevation angles (+20°/-9°), so good at fighting uphill and downhill
* Effective two axis stabilization
* Effective zoom values (4x-12x) to look for targets and place accurate shots
* The extra composite screens work as a spaced armour and are an effective protection against HEAT in some parts
* Good reverse speed (25 km/h) to get out of sticky situations
* Access to a laser range finder for quick and accurate ranging
* Access to thermal imaging to spot targets in bad conditions (only 1st gen though, 800 x 600 resolution)
* Can produce a favourable German line-up alongside the [[Leopard A1A1 (L/44)]], Leopard A1A1, Radkampfwgen 90 etc.

'''Cons:'''

* Armour will not protect you against most APFSDS rounds nor chemical rounds, especially to the front
* Roof-mounted MG are in rifle-calibres, and can not cause sufficient damage against most encountered enemies
* Heavier weight than the standard Leopard 1 due to extra screen armour affects acceleration, handling, and turret traverse

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In 1999, the Canadian Armed Forces sought to upgrade their arsenal of 66 Leopard C1s which were purchased from West Germany in June 1977. The tanks underwent refurbishment that equipped the tanks with a new turret, gunsight, and hydraulic systems for better long-distance movement. In the year 2006, the C2A1s saw action when a 15 tank squadron from the Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) was deployed to Afghanistan to support the peacekeeping effort started by the United States and other countries, which included Canada, following the September 11th terrorist attacks in New York. While in Afghanistan the squadron's C2A1's received further modification to accommodate the fighting situation. The modifications were new mine-resistant armour on the bottom of the hull to combat IEDs and anti-tank mines prevalent in the area. For the comfort of the crew, a new cooling system and thermal covers were added to the C2s serving in Afghanistan. The C2's were recalled in 2011 when Canada concluded all combat operations in Afghanistan. Canada replaced its fleet of C2A1s with new Leopard 2s in 2017.
