== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Leopard C2A1 MEXAS''' is a Canadian heavy modification of the Leopard 1A3, which is the fourth variant of the [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1 main battle tank family]]. In the late 1970s, Canada purchased 127 units of the Leopard 1A3 variant. In order to lengthen their service lives, around 114 units of Leopard C1 were upgraded to the Leopard C2 standard in 2000. The Canadian Leopard C2 was an improved Leopard C1 (Leopard 1A3) with a [[Leopard 1A5]] turret purchased from the German Ministry of Defence. The turret features an updated and improved fully stabilized 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7A3 tank gun. This tank gun can fire effectively when the tank is moving and is capable of using all NATO 105 mm tank ammunition. Thermal imaging equipment and a new computerized fire control system are standard on the Leopard C2A1. It was deployed during the Afghanistan War by the Canadian Army. There were intentions to replace these tanks with Stryker Mobile Gun Systems, but they were never carried out. Since the Leopard C2s are about 40 years old, maintenance is getting increasingly challenging. They were in service until 2015 when they were replaced by the more modern Leopard 2A4 and Leopard 2A6 variants. In general, the Leopard C2 has better armour protection than the Leopard C1. It includes NBC protection and automatic fire suppression equipment. In 2006, MEXAS add-on heavy composite armour kits were installed on them before being shipped to Afghanistan. This armour proved itself to be extremely resistant against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

Introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6808-special-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-2020-en|2020 Operation S.U.M.M.E.R. event]], the Leopard C2A1 MEXAS is a heavily modified Leopard 1A3 that is almost a unique variant in its own way. The Leopard C2A1, a hybrid between the Leopard 1A3 and the Leopard 1A5, is an attempt by the Canadian Army to extend the service life of its armoured units. MEXAS add-on heavy composite armour kits were developed primarily to counter small anti-tank weapons commonly utilized in Middle Eastern urban warfare, particularly rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). However, keep in mind that the MEXAS add-on heavy composite armour is only effective against high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunition and is only marginally effective against the standard armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding-sabot (APFSDS) ammunition used by most tanks.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The C2A1 lacks significantly in armour compared to its peers at the same BR. While it has an additional composite screen added to its entire front and sides, designed to protect it from HEAT rounds, the results are lacklustre and unreliable. Still, it does protect against the standard 20 mm autocannon found on IFVs, but its armour can be reliably penetrated by any modern APDS and APFSDS ammunition. 

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret, gun mantlet, turret ring)
* Composite screen (add-on armour on the hull and the turret)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels, tracks and bogies are 20 mm thick.
* Storage boxes at the back of the turret are 5 mm thick.
* Additional armour covers the hull and the turret:

Notes:

* Racks 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 14 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3.
* To go into battle with the frontal ammo racks empty, pack 15&nbsp;''(+40)'' shells.

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Deadly gun with excellent APFSDS rounds (408 mm penetration at 10 m, 1,455 m/s), as well as good ammo options available (HEAT, HESH rounds)
* Adequate gun depression/elevation angles (+20°/-9°), so good at fighting uphill and downhill
* Effective two axis stabilization
* Effective zoom values (4x-12x) to look for targets and place accurate shots
* The extra composite screens work as a spaced armour and are an effective protection against HEAT in some parts
* Good reverse speed (25 km/h) to get out of sticky situations
* Access to a laser range finder for quick and accurate ranging
* Access to thermal imaging to spot targets in bad conditions (only 1st gen though, 800 x 600 resolution)
* Can produce a favourable German line-up alongside the [[Leopard A1A1 (L/44)]], Leopard A1A1, Radkampfwgen 90 etc.

'''Cons:'''

* Armour will not protect you against most APFSDS rounds nor chemical rounds, especially to the front
* Roof-mounted MG are in rifle-calibres, and can not cause sufficient damage against most encountered enemies
* Heavier weight than the standard Leopard 1 due to extra screen armour affects acceleration, handling, and turret traverse

In 1999, the Canadian Armed Forces sought to upgrade their arsenal of 66 Leopard C1s which were purchased from West Germany in June 1977. The tanks underwent refurbishment that equipped the tanks with a new turret, gunsight, and hydraulic systems for better long-distance movement. In the year 2006, the C2A1s saw action when a 15 tank squadron from the Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) was deployed to Afghanistan to support the peacekeeping effort started by the United States and other countries, which included Canada, following the September 11th terrorist attacks in New York. While in Afghanistan the squadron's C2A1's received further modification to accommodate the fighting situation. The modifications were new mine-resistant armour on the bottom of the hull to combat IEDs and anti-tank mines prevalent in the area. For the comfort of the crew, a new cooling system and thermal covers were added to the C2s serving in Afghanistan. The C2's were recalled in 2011 when Canada concluded all combat operations in Afghanistan. Canada replaced its fleet of C2A1s with new Leopard 2s in 2017.
