== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Close Combat Vehicle Light (CCVL)''' is developed as part of the United States Army's Armored Gun System (AGS) competition in the 1990s to design a light tank to replace the [[M551|M551 Sheridan]] and the TOW-equipped High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV; colloquially: Humvee) to equip new light divisions. It was the culmination of various development initiatives conducted in the 1970s to provide air-mobile light infantry squads with the firepower required for success on the battlefield. The three companies that were designed for the demand were Cadillac Gage Company, Teledyne Continental, and FMC Corporation. Cadillac Gage Company designed the Stingray light tank in the standard four-man configuration. The FMC Corporation designed the CCVL in a three-man configuration due to the installation of an autoloader. Teledyne Continental designed the Expeditionary Tank in an unusual two-man configuration, featuring an unmanned turret and autoloader. In 1992, the FMC design was chosen, readjusted, and renamed the M8 Armored Gun System. However, the entire AGS project was ultimately cancelled in the mid-1980s due to funds being withdrawn due to the Gramm-Rudman Act, and procurement of the M8 Armored Gun System terminated in 1997.

Introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]] as a reward for the 2022 [[wt:en/news/7882-event-project-overpowered-en|Project "Overpowered"]] event, the CCVL is equipped with a 105 mm Rheinmetall modified M68A1 tank gun in a soft-recoil, autoloading main gun turret-mount, as well as a coaxial 7.62 mm M240 light machine gun. The three-man crew configuration included the commander and gunner in the turret, as well as the driver in the front centre of the hull. The armour provides limited protection against heavy machine gun fire and artillery shrapnel. The CCVL, which is equipped with a two-plane fully automatic stabilisation system, laser rangefinder and thermal imaging equipment for the gunner, provides outstanding firepower as well as exceptional mobility, fulfilling its historic intended duty as a light mobile gun that can be easily airdropped and deployed.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modelled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 3 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 19 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* If you pack 20&nbsp;''(+23)'' shells or fewer, it will keep the front hull empty of ammo.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-2 into rack 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Fairly quick, useful as a scout vehicle at higher BRs
* Can deploy a personal UAV
* Ammunition combined with a powerful main armament creates a deadly combination
* Much easier to aim due to two-plane stabilization

'''Cons:'''

* Lacking in armour protection, lightweight vehicle means less protection
* Can be picked off by sustained arms fire
* Transmission and engine can easily be knocked out
* Ammunition cooking is painfully common, especially when trying to rush a point
