== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

The CM52 is a solid AA choice for its tier, being equipped with four 12.7 mm M2 machine guns and is in many ways similar to the M13 and M16 GMCs. It does suffer from a lack of armour and poor frontal gun depression, but makes up for it in speed.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The CM52 is very mobile, it being wheeled means if used on a map with lots of roads, it can easily get to point A to point B much quicker than most vehicles of that battle rating. However it being wheeled also has its drawbacks, certain terrain such as mud will really hinder its movement, so its best to not go off-road.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The CM52 works similarly to the [[M16 MGMC]], as they both have the same armament and thus have more or less the same playstyle.

Staying in a spot with good visibility, including but not limited to the spawnpoint, will allow clear visibility and easy detection of enemy aircraft. Shooting at a plane from afar reduces the probability of hitting it, and since most aircraft will be performing ground attack roles, it is advised to be in a spot near action. But if you choose to be in one of those spots, make sure to stay hidden or have an ally nearby to protect you from enemy tanks. In an emergency, the guns can be turned onto the tracks of a tank, or even be used to destroy certain lightly-armoured vehicles like the Puma or the M22.

Since the CM52 is a SPAA, you can't take your eyes off the sky for long. If an enemy plane is nearby, shoot at it or where it is going to be. Despite not having cannons like the previous [[AS 42]] or the succeeding [[M42 (Italy)|M42 Contraereo]], the CM52 can still pack a punch and presents a real threat to enemy aircraft if used correctly

=== Pros and cons ===
'''Pros:'''

* Excellent armament which shreds most aircraft and is capable of destroying light tanks
* Being a wheeled vehicle, it is faster than most tanks
* Slightly smaller profile than the M13 or M16 means that it is easier to hide

'''Cons:'''

* Has wheels instead of tracks, slowing it down in soft terrain like sand, snow or mud
* No cannons unlike its predecessor and successor;
* Little armour protection: an HE shell, a strafing aircraft or even tank machine gun fire may knock it out
* Cannot shoot directly in front 
* Poor depression of the machine guns
