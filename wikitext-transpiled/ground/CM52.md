== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

The CM52 is a solid AA choice for its tier, being equipped with four 12.7 mm M2 machine guns and is in many ways similar to the M13 and M16 GMCs. It does suffer from a lack of armour and poor frontal gun depression, but makes up for it in speed.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Since the CM52 is just a transport truck with a M45 quadmount installed on the truckbed, it has barely any protection. The body is made of very thin steel, which can't even stop rifle-calibre fire at engagement range, and the only actual armour is the 7 mm RHA plate that makes up the gunner's shrapnel shield. Use your mobility to dodge or completely avoid enemy fire, and stay out of sight if targeted. However, the components don't take up much space and are spread apart, so most of the space inside is empty - especially in the truck's cabin and bed. This, combined with the very thin armour, will cause some AP shells to overpenetrate and miss most critical components.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The CM52 is very mobile, it being wheeled means if used on a map with lots of roads, it can easily get to point A to point B much quicker than most vehicles of that battle rating. However it being wheeled also has its drawbacks, certain terrain such as mud will really hinder its movement, so its best to not go off-road.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)}}

The 12.7 mm M2s are a solid group of MGs and will do well against most aircraft and lightly-armoured vehicles at this BR. While the reload time is long, the fire time more than makes up for this delay. The mount can relatively quickly be used to accost air and ground targets, though most ground vehicles will be immune to MG rounds at its BR, except for open-topped tank destroyers, SPAAs, and light reconnaissance vehicles. When an airplane is diving straight toward you, it is advisable to aim slightly to the side of whatever you are targeting in order to account for convergence issues.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The CM52 works similarly to the [[M16 MGMC]], as they both have the same armament and thus have more or less the same playstyle.

Staying in a spot with good visibility, including but not limited to the spawnpoint, will allow clear visibility and easy detection of enemy aircraft. Shooting at a plane from afar reduces the probability of hitting it, and since most aircraft will be performing ground attack roles, it is advised to be in a spot near action. But if you choose to be in one of those spots, make sure to stay hidden or have an ally nearby to protect you from enemy tanks. In an emergency, the guns can be turned onto the tracks of a tank, or even be used to destroy certain lightly-armoured vehicles like the Puma or the M22.

Since the CM52 is a SPAA, you can't take your eyes off the sky for long. If an enemy plane is nearby, shoot at it or where it is going to be. Despite not having cannons like the previous [[AS 42]] or the succeeding [[M42 (Italy)|M42 Contraereo]], the CM52 can still pack a punch and presents a real threat to enemy aircraft if used correctly

=== Pros and cons ===
'''Pros:'''

* Excellent armament which shreds most aircraft and is capable of destroying light tanks
* Being a wheeled vehicle, it is faster than most tanks

'''Cons:'''

* Has wheels instead of tracks, slowing it down in soft terrain like sand, snow or mud
* No cannons unlike its predecessor and successor;
* Little armour protection: an HE shell, a strafing aircraft or even tank machine gun fire may knock it out
* Cannot shoot directly in front
* Poor gun depression of the machine guns

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The CM52 is a postwar technical based on the civillian truck Fiat 639. It was powered by the Fiat 364A 7 litre diesel motor which produced 92 horsepower. The CM52 was equipped with a Maxon M45 quad-mount consisting of four M2HB .50 machine guns firing at a combined 2,300 rpm. The CM52 began production in 1952. <ref>https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/472172-fiat-6601-acm-52-quadrinata-us-guns-italian-truck/</ref>
