== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a prototype wheeled assault gun based on the Patria AMV (Armored Modular Vehicle) with a Cockerill CT-CV 105HP gun system. The design of the CT-CV 105HP makes it compatible with a variety of NATO APCs including the Finnish Patria AMV 8x8 chassis; the system underwent extensive tests in mid-2000s. While the turret system has been integrated with Korea's K21-105 fire support vehicle, the version with Patria AMV chassis has yet to secure orders from overseas customers.

The Patria CT-CV 105HP was introduced during [[Update "La Royale"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8384-event-summer-extreme-en|2023 Summer Extreme]] event. Not only does it have rather high speed on different ground surfaces, the autoloading 105 mm gun with varieties of ammunition including a Ukrainian 105 mm cannon-launched ATGM will make sure the CT-CV has the flexibility to deal with any targets it might face. Players still have to be careful not to over-extend - the vehicle is not designed for the most heated battlefields with an abundance of MBTs.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Patria CT-CV 105HP comprises of a Finnish Patria AMV chassis and Belgian Cockerill CT-CV 105HP gun system. One thing players will soon notice is the rather high overall profile (the chassis is 2.3 m while the turret is around 1.5 m due to the turret ring adapter), which makes it quite a noticeable target even from afar. The turret shares some similarities with the XC-8 turret found on the [[CV 90105]] as they are both produced by Cockerill and house the same 105 mm gun. A common stereotype for wheeled APCs is the less-protected chassis for the need of weight reduction; however, this is not the case for the Patria AMV as the frontal protection is rated for STANAG 4569 Level 4a/b protection (14.5x114 mm at 200 m), making any autocannons/HMGs below 20 mm without APDS struggle to penetrate its UFP with applique armour. This will make CT-CV more confident against lower tier IFVs with such autocannons; while it can even stop 30 mm AP-T shells at such distance, but it is suggested to avoid higher calibre APDS/APFSDS at all cost as they can easily tear down the CT-CV even at distance. The turret is another story: due to the heightened turret ring to fit the CT-CV 105HP, in some cases, enemy autocannons will land on the turret ring and causing fatal damages to the turret components or crews; the turret itself is not well-protected against 20 mm autocannons as well.

The crew placement is very similar to the [[M1128]] MGS with the driver placed far away from the turret crews; if the vehicle is hit from the sides, it is likely to be hit in the engine/transmission, but the gun crews will still be able to retaliate. However, unlike M1128, the CT-CV turret is manned, located inside the turret basket at turret ring height. HEAT or HE will also certainly disintegrate the turret alongside its crews, knocking the vehicle out right away.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
Thanks to the DI 12 Scania Diesel engine that can output up to 600 hp and the ZF 7HP902 transmission, it can push CT-CV at up to 100 km/h on-road; it might not have the fastest reverse speed for assault guns (but still faster than M1128) at 17 km/h, but it is still sufficient to move away from enemies.

The CT-CV turret mounts a Cockerill 105 mm L/50 cannon. For players who already own the [[CV 90105]], they will be very familiar with the overall performance of the ammunition available, while the new turret featuring electric gun laying motor also makes the traverse rate significantly faster than any other assault guns in-game even at stock. The vertical limits are sufficient at up to 10° depression, making peeking tactics very viable for the vehicle to minimize the overall profile using terrain or cover.

==== Ammunition ====
{{:L/50 (105 mm)/Ammunition|M1061, M393A2, M416, DM23, DM33, Falarick 105}}

'''M1061 HEAT-FS, stock:''' The stock ammunition for the CT-CV; like most 105 mm HEAT-FS in NATO/PLAGF service, it might not have a problem damaging light vehicles or SPAAs at its tier, but in the case of well-armoured MBTs which are sometimes equipped with ERA packages, it will struggle to penetrate them from the front; even shots on the sides can be frustrating due to the lack of spalling of HEAT shells.

'''M393A2 HESH, tier I:''' One of the tier I ammunitions for the CT-CV; thanks to the features of HESH, unless the shell lands on a very flat angle, it will most likely "stick" onto enemy's surfaces and blasting shrapnel inside the crew compartments of vehicles. It will be a great alternative to HEAT-FS to hit players behind cover but has some parts exposed to your line of fire, as well as more reliable against light vehicles or SPAAs.

'''DM23 APFSDS, tier I:''' This is one of the tier I ammunitions for the CT-CV and the first kinetic shell for the vehicle; the equivalent of M111 APFSDS. While the penetration is nowhere enough to penetrate most MBTs at its tier, having kinetic shells makes long-range shots much easier and helps to grind through the early days of research.

'''DM33 APFSDS, tier IV:''' This is the other kinetic shell for the vehicle; although it has the lowest penetration among late 105 mm APFSDS at only 408 mm point-blank, it is after all still a long-rod APFSDS with higher penetration and spalling than previous ammunitions. This will be the go-to ammunition once players research DM33.

'''Falarick 105, tier II:''' Oddly enough, instead of being manufactured in NATO/US-allied countries, the Falarick 105 is in fact a Ukrainian cannon-launched tandem-warhead ATGM designed specifically for the Cockerill 105 mm L/50 cannon. Although it has much lower penetration that its Chinese counterpart at only 550 mm, the explosive content and velocity can certainly give enemy MBTs or light vehicles a bad day, sometimes even helicopters will fall victim of the missile if they get too close or hover for too long.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Very high speed and mobility, great for flanking and traversing larger, open maps
* Autoloader grants a steady short reload time
* Fast-moving, gun-launched Falarick 105 ATGM, perfect for distant targets or helicopters
* Faster turret rotation speed
* Great gun elevation and depression angles
* Has a laser warning system
* Has Gen 3 thermal imager for the gunner
* Has a coaxial 12.7 mm MG to help with lightly-armoured targets, or to break tracks

'''Cons:'''

* Poor reverse speed compared to overall mobility
* Bad stationary mobility, can't turn while standing still, has to move forward or backwards to turn
* High profile and nonexistent armour, can only stop 30 mm autocannon rounds
* Unstable at high speed, over ~55 km/h the main gun looses stability and starts to sway up and down, this also applies to driving, as the vehicle can be sent flying on even smaller bumps, this will drain all your speed and leave you in compromising positions
* The Falarick 105 ATGM has poor penetrative capabilities compared to the CT CV's BR
* Autoloader only holds 10 rounds, the rest are stored in the hull under the turret basket, these are placed dangerously and should be avoided
* Only has 3 crew, reducing the vehicle's survivability
