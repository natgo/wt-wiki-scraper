== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Annotation|CTWV|Common Tactical Wheeled Vehicle}} {{Annotation|RCV|Recon Combat Vehicle}}''' is a squadron rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Dance of Dragons"]].

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Dating back to January 2018, the development of the '''CTWV (Common Tactical Wheeled Vehicle)''' program started with the JGSDF requesting both Mitsubishi and Komatsu to provide prototypes to a new series of wheeled vehicles to replace the ageing Type 96 Wheeled APCs and supplement their prototypes with combat variants. Mitsubishi based their CTWV on the already developed [[Type 16 (Family)|Type 16 MCV]] (Program A), while Komatsu, as the original developer of the Type 96 WAPC, pushed a redesigned upgrade of the Type 96 WAPC (Program B). Komatsu's project was soon cancelled in July 2018, leaving Mitsubishi as the only remaining developer.

Mitsubishi, who aimed to standardize the design using the Type 16 MCV platform and components, developed three primary variants for the CTWV program:
* (CTWV) ICV <small>(Infantry Combat Vehicle)</small> - 30 mm Bushmaster + Mk 52 chain gun
* (CTWV) RCV <small>(Recon Combat Vehicle)</small> - Same as ICV including a surveillance camera and a satellite communication antenna
* (CTWV) MM <small>(Mobile Mortar)</small> - 120 mm Thales mortar system

{{Notice|The design work for these configurations was most likely recycled from the previous "{{Annotation|将来装輪戦闘車両|Shōrai Sō wa sentō sharyō}}" (Future Wheeled Combat Vehicle) project, precursor to the Type 16 MCV.}}

With these prototypes built and tested in 2023-24, procurement of these vehicles are listed as "Type 24 ICV/MM" with the expected designation of the RCV as "Type 25 RCV". Further orders were made on the vehicles by FY 2024; 24 ICVs and 8 MMs, with expectations for an additional 18 ICVs, 8 MMs, and 8 RCVs in FY 2025.

Together with the license production of the AMV Patria in 2022, the CTWV, soon to be most likely known as the officially adopted Type 24, will continue the wheeled mobilization of the JGSDF.
