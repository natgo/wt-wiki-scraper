== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The CV9030FIN has 20 mm of frontal hull armour, which is not significant enough to stop anything larger than a 14.5 mm machine gun. However, the upper plate is angled very well and as such could possibly prevent low-penetration auto-cannons from damaging the vehicle; the hull front, with its slope, can offer from 20 mm on the lower glacis up to almost 90 mm of effective thickness on the upper glacis. The side armour is composed of two spaced plates, one 6 mm and one 10 mm plate (for a total of 16 mm). This is enough to stop low-calibre machine guns, but a .50 cal will penetrate the armour with ease. A fuel tank is located between the spaced armour plates of the left side of the hull, right beneath the turret; the fuel tank is able to absorb machine gun bullets, protecting the turret crew from the left side from machine gun fire. The rear of the hull has 20 mm of armour, enough to stop low-calibre machine guns. Shots by large calibre cannons to the turret will more often than not only kill a single crew-member allowing an attacking response or swift retreat.

'''Armour type:'''

* Body made entirely of rolled homogeneous armour
* Structural steel boxes attached to sides and rear of turret
* Composite screen covering front, sides of turret, and sides of hull

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels, tracks, and bogies are 15 mm thick.
* Belly armour and the bottom plate above the tracks are 10 mm thick.
* Mudguards are 5 mm thick.
* Inner armour plates protect the sides of the crew compartment (the upper section over the tracks only).
* The engine is separated from the driver position and the crew compartment by an armour plate.
* The driver viewport is a weak spot as it is the only place where the inner armour does not overlap with the external armour.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
APFSDS round allows adequate penetration of MBTs from the side and rear angles and is best utilized to position the vehicle to allow such shots. While acceleration is poor, the fair top speed allows creative positioning and the good reverse speed provides for the ability to use shoot and scoot tactics. Only IFVs and other lightly armoured vehicles can reliably be destroyed from the front.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Amazing vertical guidance for both main gun and machine gun
* Magazine fed gun instead of single shells like on the CV9040 variants
* Engine block at the front of the vehicle can tank some damage
* APFSDS has decent penetration which allows the tank to penetrate the sides and backs of most tanks

'''Cons:'''

* Thermals and APFSDS are Rank III modifications which require some time to get
* .50 cal fire can penetrate the back of the vehicle
* Mediocre acceleration, takes rather long to get to the top speed
* Has only one turret-fixed 7.62 mm machine gun, rendering it useless against targets when the turret is knocked out
