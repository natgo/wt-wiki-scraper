The '''Rocket Launcher T34 (Calliope)''' was a special modification of the second variant of the early-generation [[M4 Sherman (Family)|Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family]]. The U.S. Ordnance Department initiated a series of projects experimenting with the attachment of rocket launchers to the [[M4|M4 Sherman]], in order to provide enhanced firepower to its infantry. Despite the fact that its 75 mm M3 tank gun was capable of firing very efficient ammunition, it was unable to handle massive waves of assaulting enemies. Furthermore, it was also insufficient against the Germans' heavily entrenched strongholds. Although not as precise as traditional artillery, rockets can cover a bigger area in less time with explosives and shrapnel, saturating a target in seconds. Rockets also have a negative psychological impact on enemies under rocket attack because of the howling sounds they make as they fly through the air. The most renowned of these tank-mounted rocket launchers was the Rocket Launcher T34, which was called "Calliope" after the Steam Organ due to the deafening roar that burst from the tubes when the rockets were fired.

Introduced in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"]], the Calliope is a unique modified M4 Sherman capable of firing rockets (60 rockets in total) at adversaries as a secondary weapon. Originally designed for anti-infantry use, the 114 mm M8 rockets with high-explosive (HE) warhead rockets carry high explosive warheads that can effectively destroy light enemy vehicles and damage heavier armoured targets sufficiently to make the enemy's repair time extremely long and miserable. It is advised to use many rockets on enemies since a single rocket is frequently insufficient to damage them. Furthermore, the weapon, like any other ground vehicle firing unguided rockets, would emit an extremely loud but distinct firing signature, allowing opponents to identify the type of vehicle as well as its location on the map. The unique smoke trail left by fired rockets might potentially reveal the player's location. However, the M8 rockets' faster fire rate enables many volleys of rockets to be fired at a target in rapid succession. The resulting flash, fire, and smoke effects of continuous bombardment on a target can temporarily blind targets and can thus be employed as an emergency smoke cover. However, the rocket should not be used as a primary anti-tank weapon because it lacks the explosive strength and penetration to successfully destroy tanks. The Calliope's primary weapon is the 75 mm M3 tank cannon, which is more than capable of engaging most opponents in its ranks.

The Sherman Calliope, offers 114 M8 rockets which are mounted on top of the turret, these are stored in a rack which houses the rockets. The mount is also a separate ammo rack, if hit it can destroy the rockets and a repair will have to be performed. Machine gun fire can also destroy the rockets and large machine fire from large calibre machine guns, aircraft and autocannons or larger will destroy the rack and rockets.

With a large calibre HE round, a single hit to the rocket rack can knock out the entire tank. Since the round detonates all the rockets in the rack explode, causing an apocalyptic explosion which blows the turret off and knocks out the crew.

The rocket rack is not protected by any armour plates, it only has 5 mm structural steel. Since the rocket racks are installed above the turret, it allows you to fire over objects. However, the disadvantage is you can no longer hide behind rocks and objects for safety.
Using the M8 rockets, the M8 rockets are not armour piercing they are high explosive meaning they will detonate when they hit something. The M8 rockets can be used to distract enemy tankers and cause lots of damage to their tanks. Another advantage of using the rockets, they fire rapidly and can knock out light tanks and lightly armoured fighting vehicles with ease.

The Sherman Calliope packs the legendary 75 mm, M3 cannon the cannon can make short work of enemy tanks. To best use this cannon, use the shot and AP rounds. It's best not to have any rockets in your rocket ammo rack, when you engage in short close range combat, due to the risk of a HE or an arty round penetrating and knocking out your tanks by destroying the rocket racks.

However, using the cannon and rockets together can be an exceptionally good combination – the quick reload time of the cannon and combined with the rockets makes for a very potent tank. To get the best out of this, use the terrain to your advantage. Use buildings and trees to hide behind, then pop out when the enemy drives by and shoot them fire the rockets to cause disorientation, they will produce a thick dark cloud preventing your target from locating you. Then fire the 75 mm M3 cannon into the enemy turret and knock it out.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Armament:
** Quick-firing 75 mm gun with adequate shell options
** Is now equipped with 60 rockets, a salvo can blind or even cripple, if not destroy other enemy tanks
** Despite the rockets having very low penetration, the rack sits about a 1 meter above the already tall Sherman, allowing the calliope to hit the very weak top armour of its target at close range
* Armour:
** Reasonably good frontal protection, can work nicely when in down-tiers
** Turret is quite strong

'''Cons:'''

* Size:
** The Sherman is already a pretty large vehicle, the addition of the rockets makes the Calliope stick out like a sore thumb.
* Armament:
** The 75 mm gun begins to lack the penetration to go up against tougher foes
** Does not get access to the T45 APCR shot
** Rockets are inaccurate past ~100 m
** Rockets act as a massive (and unarmoured) ammunition rack
** Rockets only have 29 mm of penetration
** Loses access to the .50 cal M2 machine gun
** The distinctive firing sound of the rockets can lure unwanted enemies
** The rocket launcher is not linked to the main gun and will also aim at the target marker, meaning it will point downwards when you have returned to cover and the target marker is on the cover directly in front of you.
* Armour:
** Overall armour protection is no longer effective against tougher foes, especially against the German long 75 mm gun
** The extra 25.4 mm side plating indicates the location of ammunition racks (can be resolved by taking less than 23 cannon rounds)

===Development===
Midway into World War II in 1943, the Western Allies realized that unlike the Soviet Union, they did not have any form of a "multiple rocket launcher system" that the Soviets had with their ''Katyusha Launchers'' trucks. The idea of rocket launchers isn't new at this period, they present some advantage over the standard mortar or howitzer. The rocket launcher can launch massive amounts of high-explosive ammunition at a longer distance at a shorter time with a greater psychological impact than normal artillery, at the price of a longer reload time and less accuracy. The Soviets showed the best utilization of this weapon with their ''Katyushas'', having a whole bunch of them fire at a designated target, minimizing accuracy loss with a full area saturation of fire. The effectiveness of this system prompted the Allies to start producing some form of multiple rocket launcher system as well.

In 1943, the project began in the United States and the design was to use the current [[M4|M4 Sherman]] tanks in service to mount the rocket launchers to bring into combat. The design, developed by Victor Hawkins, had a rocket mount on the Sherman turret with sixty launch tubes, all made to fire the 4.5 in. M8 rockets. The project gave the experimental tank design the designation '''T34''', and the troops adopted the name '''"Calliope"''', which was the name of a steam organ and has a similar look.

===Combat usage===
These rocket launcher tanks were sent to France in 1944, although many never saw combat for various reasons. During its development, three different variants were made. The original T34 had 60 tubes for the 4.5 in. rockets with 36 fixed tubes on top and 24 on the bottom able to be jettisoned (except on the [[M4A1|M4A1 Sherman]] variant). The second, T34E1, has the 24 jettisonable tubes replaced by 28 tubes, though the total tubes were still 60. The T34E2 had the rocket calibre increased from 4.5 in. to 7.2 in. with the same 60 tubes. This saw combat during the 1944-1945 time span.

However, the modifications of the Shermans seem unnecessary as the war progressed, new development had the rocket launcher system mated to trucks, armoured chassis, and jeeps so the tanks could be left alone to do its purpose. But when the Calliope saw service in the Pacific and Europe, its performance was moderately successful. The T34 was replaced by the T40 "Whiz Bang" Sherman, which was a Sherman with a tank-mounted multiple rocket launcher system like the T34, but only saw combat in the last few months of the war and had the 7.2 in. rockets.

A jet-powered volley-fire system on the base of regular Sherman tank, it received the addition of a T34E1 launch system with a tubes for M8 missiles. The first versions had the body of a T34, which did not allow them to fire the tank cannon, so a modification of the T34E1 was created that was equipped with a special adapter that allowed the tank cannon to be fired on that body.
