== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} has little armour but enough to trigger the fuse in APHE type projectiles. The lack of armour makes this vehicle very agile.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* Wheel (tires)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof
|-
| Hull || 15 mm (80°) ''Upper Glacis'' <br> 35 mm (45°) ''Lower Glacis'' || 25 mm (47°) ''Top'' <br> 25 mm (0-28°) ''Bottom'' || 20 mm (21°) || 15 mm (20°) ''Front glacis'' <br> 20 mm ''Crew compartment'' <br> 10 mm ''Engine vent''
|-
|Turret || 25 mm (19°)''Turret front'' <br> 40 mm (6°-51°-56°) ''Gun mantlet'' || 25 mm (18°) || 15+15 mm (12°) ''Left section'' <br> 15 mm ''Right section'' <br> 10 mm (85°) ''Turret overhang''|| 15+15 mm (5°) ''Front''  <br> 15 mm ''Rear''
|}
'''Notes:'''

* The wheels and suspension bars are 10 mm thick.
* The rear of the turret is covered with 5 mm of structural steel.
* Additionally to the external armour, an armour plate is also found inside the vehicle:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Spaced Armour !! Front (Slope angle)
|-
| Hull || 8 mm (except driver view port)
|-
|}

'''Notes:'''

* The engine is separated from the driver position and the crew compartment by a RHA armour plate.
* The driver viewport is a weak spot as it is the only place where the inner armour does not overlap with the external armour. It is a small spot though.

Notes:

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 3 and 4 are first stage ammo racks. They totals 16 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 3 - 1 - 2.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-2 into rack 4 then 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.

With a top speed of 110 km/h, a two-plane stabilizer, and access to thermals and HEAT-FS, the Centauro is truly a jack of all trades. This AFV can fill a variety of roles with frightening efficiency.

'''As a sniper'''

In a sniping role, the Centauro has two primary advantages: it has access to HEAT-FS, and it has thermal imaging. The HEAT-FS round has good velocity and is often more than enough to deal significant damage to any poor enemy tank that enters your gunsights. The thermal imaging mod allows you to pick out targets and countersnipe like nobody's business, letting you be able to dominate the battlefield for your team.

'''As a flanker'''

As a flanker, the Centauro's lightning fast speed and two-plane stabilizer allows this AFV to quickly obliterate unaware enemy tanks and move on before anyone notices. This deadly combo makes the Centauro one of, if not ''the best'' vehicle for flanking in the entire game. A resourceful Centauro player can often make use of their low profile and fast speed to quickly break through enemy lines and wreck havoc on tunnel-visioned snipers.

'''As a Quick Response Force'''

The Centauro's fast speed and very deadly gun, along with its aforementioned stabilizer and thermals also make it a very good choice for a QRF, ''especially'' on maps covered mostly in asphalt, like Cargo Port, American Desert, or Alaska, to name a few. The fast speed of the Centauro allows to to quickly move to a capture point or to kill a pesky spawncamping Rooikat at a moments notice, and its two-plane stabilizer and thermal imaging lets it quickly find and dispatch its target.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Easily the fastest and most agile tank compared to its contemporary competitors
* Excellent reverse speed of 40 km/h
* Has a two-plane gun stabiliser
* High penetration on the HEATFS rounds (400 mm)
* One of the best top speeds in the game (110 km/h)
* Decent reload time, 8.7 seconds when stock, 7.7 with expert crew + all reloading skills, and 6.7 seconds with an aced crew
* Three types of ammunition available (APFSDS, HEATFS, HESH)
* Upper plate will occasionally bounce incoming shells due to its angle, even HEATFS and HESH!
* Has access to smoke grenades and smoke shells
* Low silhouette
* Hard to destroy in a single shot due to crew placement
* Can perform a wide variety of roles, ranging from support, sniper and QRF
* Has thermal sights, very advantageous at the rank
* A group of well-coordinated players in Centauros are unstoppable
* Classified as a tank destroyer, making spawn costs cheaper in RB and SB
* Thermal imaging is a tier 1 mod, allowing you to unlock it immediately

'''Cons:'''

* Lacking in armour department, every gun can penetrate it including SPAA
* Vulnerable to overpressure damage (HE shells, rochets, missiles, bombs, artillery strikes)
* Turret traverse is slow compared to other vehicles at the same battle rating such at the [[T95E1]], [[BMP-2]], and [[Warrior]] which you will face often
* Poor accuracy at a medium-long range when stock
* Doesn't come with stock HESH; has to be researched
* No explosive-filler shells (eg APHE, APCB)
* HEATFS does not shrapnel well

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Development of the B1 Centauro began during the 1980s after the Italian Army issued a set of requirements for a new vehicle that would have equivalent firepower to the Leopard 1 MBT in Italian service at the time, but with greater combat mobility.

In response to this, the Italian companies Fiat, Iveco and Oto Melara joined forces to begin developing the vehicle requested by the Italian Army. In this joint venture, Fiat and Iveco were developing the vehicle's hull and power supply, whilst Oto Melara took care of the vehicle's turret and weapon systems.

In 1986, the final prototype of the B1 Centauro project was unveiled on Sardinia. The presented vehicle was an eight-wheeled lightly armoured tank destroyer, equipped with a derived modification of the L7 105mm cannon, capable of reaching a very high top speed and covering large distances under its own power.

Impressed by the B1 Centauro, the Italian Military placed orders for a number of vehicles, with the first ones entering service as early as 1992. Early on in its service life, the Centauro received an ERA upgrade package that allowed for the installation of [[Centauro ROMOR|ROMOR ERA]] packs on the vehicle's hull and turret sides as well as rear.

B1 Centauros took part in most major conflicts that defined the '90s and early 2000s, most notably in former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan and others. Apart from the Italian Army, other noteworthy operators of the Centauro include Spain, Jordan and Oman.

Around 400 B1 Centauros were built until 2006, including some other derived modifications of the vehicle filling other roles. The B1 Centauro still serves with the Italian as well as other armed forces to this day.
