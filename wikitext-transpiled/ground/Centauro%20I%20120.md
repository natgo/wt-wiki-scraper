== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]]. It is also known as the Centauro MGS.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The armour of the Centauro I 120 is the same as the previous Centauros, mediocre against everything but calibres smaller than 14.5 mm HMG fire. It has additional armour plates which give it decent armour protection to shrapnel fragmentation as well as autocannons. However, it is vulnerable to overpressure. The lack of armour is however compensated by adopting a playstyle based on the increased mobility to position your vehicle in unexpected spots. This is what the Centauros excel at. Fast speed, manoeuvrability and relatively small profile helps it disguise, move and stay under cover at almost all times.

'''Armour type:'''

- High Hardness Rolled Armour
- Aluminium alloy 7020
- Composite Screens

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=806|rbMinHp=460}}

Like the previous Centauros, it has one of the best mobility for wheeled vehicles. It has the same performance as the [[Centauro|Blindo Armata B1 Centauro]] despite the additional armour and a heavier gun. It still lacks performance on snow and somewhat on sand. However, it has the best weight/power ratio for wheeled vehicles of similar size. It should be noted that the MGS, as previous Centauros, is not amphibious.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
'''<big>Unlock order recommendations</big>'''

The order of modifications should be well thought out. Below is a guide of which modifications to unlock first, but it is just a recommendation and can be modified or adapted depending on the tank commander's preferences.

'''Tier 1'''

One tier 1 modification needs researched before you can move on to tier 2 but there are three modifications in tier 1 that are very heavily recommended to unlock before moving on. These are parts - one of the most important overall because the tank can not be repaired without it, DM33 because as an APFSDS round it has a much higher effectiveness against well armoured tanks, and NVD because it allows access to both gunner and commander thermal sights for easier spotting of enemy tanks. Again, it is highly recommended to research these three modifications before moving on to tier 2 even though you technically only need one of them. A recommended order is DM33 then parts then NVD. After this moving on to tier 2 is recommended.

'''Tier 2'''

Three modifications from tier 2 are needed to move on to tier 3 and these should be FPE so you can put out fires and also LR/LWS because the laser rangefinder allows for taking accurate shots at long range with a better first shot hit probability. The third could be either adjustment of fire for increased accuracy or airstrike to allow spawning in a plane easier, either one is a good option but which of the two is up to the vehicle commander. After three are researched moving on to tier 3 would be a good choice.

'''Tier 3'''

Only two modifications are needed from tier 3 to move on to tier 4. Improved optics should definitely be put off for later but of the other three none of them is a bad pick. Elevation mechanism probably isn't necessary in most cases so crew replenishment to allow the replacing of a knocked out crew member and filters for increased mobility are probably the most logical picks. After two tier 3 mods are unlocked the player should move on to more useful ones in tier 4.

'''Tier 4'''

Tier 4 has a few useful modifications, particularly the CL3143 APFSDS round which is one of the very best APFSDS rounds in the game. The engine modification should also be prioritized as well as the smoke grenade modification. After these three are researched, which are recommended to be unlocked in that order, then it is time to go back and get any modifications that haven't been unlocked yet.

'''Finishing up'''

Some of the more useful modifications that likely haven't been unlocked yet include transmission, tires, artillery support, and horizontal drive. There are also less useful modifications that should be saved for last including suspension, brake system, and improved optics. Now you have a fully upgraded vehicle, good job!

{{main|OTO Melara 120/45 (120 mm)}}

The Centauro I 120 has access to the powerful 120 mm OTO Melara 120/45 smoothbore cannon, the same cannon mounted on the Ariete MBT. It has the same handling as it utilizes the same ammunition and has the same ballistic performance.

==== Ammunition ====
The Centauro I 120 has access to a wide variety of ammunition which are the deadliest at the game, specially the CL3143.

- DM12A1: this is the starter HEATFS round when it comes stock. It can be considered mediocre as the MBTs faced at the battle rating are more than capable of withstanding it. However, it is specially useful when dealing at long distances and when lightly armoured vehicles are seen (SPAA for example) as they will be destroyed because of overpressure damage once hit.
- DM33: this is a round seen in most NATO MBTs in the game (or similar to them), it has decent performance and is able to kill pretty much everything it faces with exception of Russian MBTs with CONTACT-5 ERA (unless the K5 is destroyed first).
- CL3143: this is the best performing round. It is able to penetrate and destroy all MBTs in the game, even Russian vehicles with CONTACT-5 ERA.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|Beretta MG42/59 (7.62 mm)}}

The MGS is armed with the already seen MG42/59 and a newly mounted M2HB. As seen in previous Centauros, the 7.62 mm are only effective against low flying aircraft and obstacle removal, they are inefficient for anything else. However, the M2HB is a nice addition to the anti-aircraft capabilities and even anti-tank capabilities. It is able to damage gun barrels and tracks upon continuous firing and able to take down SPAA like the Tunguska, Roland SAM and ADATS due to their low armour.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Centauro I 120 should be played as the rest as the Centauros but not quite. Speed, firepower and low profile should be used to perform flanking manoeuvres, get quickly into sniping positions and surprise the enemy.

'''As a flanker:'''

The role is pretty straight forward: use your speed and agility to get behind the enemy, cause confusion and engage them as fast as you can. The MGS, like the other Centauros, does not have the issue of needing to stop in order to make a successful flanking. Thanks to the two-plane stabilizer, it is able to fire while moving in order to make the enemies' life difficult when engaging you.

'''As a sniper:'''

Like previous Centauros, this is nothing new as the use of thermals, really good zoom sights, fast muzzle velocity rounds and laser rangefinder make this one of the easiest "point-and-click" vehicle in the game. It is recommended to utilize APFSDS when doing long range engagements all the times. Not only for the fact it has much better penetration than the HEATFS but also because of the muzzle velocity. The speed makes it easier to aim than the HEATFS.

'''Cap rusher:'''

This is nothing new for any of the Italian wheeled vehicles. Spawn, rush as fast as possible a cap point, capture, leave as fast as possible. This can be done really easily with this Centauro despite what looks like a "sluggish" Centauro. The MGS should not be underestimated in terms of speed.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- 120 mm APFSDS offers improved penetration and damage over the 105 mm gun
- Extremely fast and mobile on road
- Has night vision devices and generation 1 gunner thermals
- Good turret traverse speed
- Smoke grenades cover player when there is danger
- 12.7 mm MG is effective against similar light vehicles/helicopters
- An aced crew can fire the second best APFSDS round in the game every five seconds
- Access to the scouting ability

'''Cons:'''

- Little to no protection against most projectiles
- Vulnerable to overpressure damage
- Tall and long
- Very sluggish on soft terrain (mud, snow or sand)
- Rearward turret placement, sometimes frontal hull is exposed while turret is still behind cover
- Only -6 degrees of gun depression
- Stock grind is difficult with vehicle having low manoeuvrability, thin armour and stock HEATFS before modifications are unlocked
- High recoil when firing from the sides or rear of the vehicle, knocking the sights off target

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The story of the B1 Centauro MGS starts during the late stages of the Cold War, there was a need of up gunning the B1 Centauro, already in service in the Italian army, so the Iveco-Oto Melara Consortium (CIO) would take lead. An evaluation of sorts would begin in which the B1 Centauro would have an entirely new turret applied to it. The new turret would be called "HITFACT 105-120 mm (LOW RECOIL FORCE TURRET)", the turret had almost the same weight as the 105 mm turret of the B1 Centauro series (1/2/3), but with an increase in ballistic protection. The new cannon replaced the standard 105 mm cannon with an Italian-made 120 mm one (this brought the firepower on par with the majority of MBTs).

The turret was made in such a way that it could easily be installed on pretty much anything that could support it, and since it was lightweight this really allowed it to outclass a lot of what it would face. Another reason it being lightweight helped it, was how it had little to no effect to its mobility, which meant the best of both speed and firepower could be achieved. Among other changes, the Hitfact turret would incorporate many advancement that would not be prevalent on many vehicles of its class before.

The gun would controlled by a new FCS, which included a gunner's self-stabilized day and night IR thermal camera periscope, with an integral eye-safe laser rangefinder. On the turret of the MGS, there is also numerous periscopes positioned at 360°, which can be used by both the gunner and the commander. The MGS is also capable of firing all NATO standard 120 mm munitions, and has shown it can fire rounds such as DM11, a high explosive round with a programmable fuse. One last noteworthy addition were the appliqué screens around the vehicle, which it's said can protect against low calibre autocannon fire.

The MGS would first be shown to the public in its official debut, at IDEX 2003. During the course of its development, the MGS's would enter limited production, and be used by the Italian army, mainly for testing, such as how a 120 mm version of the Centauro would be(this later on lead to the development of the B2 Centauro). Due to this, the B1 Centauro MGS would change and be offered for export, and as it was being showed in multiple expos, it ended up getting picked up by the Royal Omani Guard. It is not known how many they currently have in service, but what is known is that they decided to repaint them in a tan/brownish pattern to better suit its operational environment. Other than that, Leonardo has kept on marketing the turret system on multiple different hulls, such as one being on the Patria AMV and another being presented on top of a German Marder.
