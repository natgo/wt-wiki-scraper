== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]].

The Centauro RGO is an Omani export variant of the Centauro B1 MGS. In 2008, the Royal Guards of Oman (RGO) imported six tanks but in the following years ordered three more. The RGO differentiates itself with the infamous HITFACT turret from OTO Melara, featuring the 120 mm/45 gun. With this turret added, the tank is now more likely to withstand a hit in the turret, unlike previous Centauros where the turret was a significant weak spot. The 120 mm gun makes it deadly on top of that, as it has access to the powerful CL3143 shell, capable of penetrating all Russian vehicles equipped with CONTACT-5 ERA.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.
