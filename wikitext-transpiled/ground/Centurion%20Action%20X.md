== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.93 "Shark Attack"]].

The imponent-looking prototype, the Centurion X, is a tank with a unique personality. The vehicle will be appreciatively friendly to the aspiring tankers and veterans of the British tanks, while also setting a small peak of what the latter ranks got to offer.

With a fair share of mobility and firepower, the Centurion X is a good premium vehicle in the British Post-war lineup. The novelty is about the now, more sloped turret armour features. Despite the evidence of some inadequate armour angles, the tank can surely stand on its own, if played appropriately, with a playstyle pretty much comparable to its tech tree development cousin, the [[FV4202]].

Overall a good way to research higher ranks, learn more about the game style and earn some nifty Silver Lions rewards!

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, turret roof, cupola roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, cupola sides and center)

==== Ammunition ====
The ammunition available to the {{PAGENAME}} offers a wide range of projectiles to engage most types of targets:

* '''Shot Mk.1''': APCBC; an armour-piercing capped shell with ballistic cap that has a good penetration power but a rather average post-penetration damage effect. Make sure to target modules and crew positions to maximize the damage inflicted.
* '''Shot Mk.3''': APDS; an armour-piercing discarding sabot shot that has a very high penetration power but a poor post-penetration damage effect. Make sure to target modules and crew positions to maximize the damage inflicted.
* '''Shell Mk.1''': HE; a shell useful for destroying open and lightly-armoured vehicles but travelling at a low speed.
* '''20pdr Shell SS Mk.1''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives. However, it is a very slow shell.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear from the rack after having been loaded in the breech.
* Racks 10 and 11 are first stage ammo racks. They total 12 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These 2 racks are also emptied first when firing: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 10 - 11 - 1 - 2 - etc. until 9.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-9 into racks 11 then 10. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

The small calibre of the L3A1 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
At first glance, the Centurion Action X does not bring a significant change in playstyle. Compared to equivalent-rank vehicles, battle usage can be straightforward. But there are some meaningful lessons for future medium tanks that excel at support roles down the rank, namely the [[Chieftain (Family)|Chieftains]].

One way to master this tank's capabilities is to minimize its weaknesses. Knowing the limited maximum speed, the commanders often should resort to long-distance gunnery. This long-range shooting is, in fact, very healthy for the Centurion X. The firepower is more than sufficient to cause damage in most ranges; thus, sniping is where most mainstream British medium tanks will excel. 

The shoot-and-scoot tactic benefits the Centurion Action X. It will protect the vehicle from prolonged exposure as the lower turret is poorly armoured to withstand serious firepower. One way to stay alive is never to expose your lower half of the turret.

An early game planning of the map positioning will allow the Centurion Action X to strike lethally without being immediately obliterated. However, players should keep in mind another forte of most British MBTs down the line; this is the flexibility of the gun elevation. Therefore slopes, cliffs and trenches on maps such as [[Ash River]], [[Carpathians (Ground Forces)|Carpathians]] or [[Fulda (Ground Forces)|Fulda]], should be used to multiply the damage the Centurion can cause. 

The sniper or support role can provide the best results in the long run, as most tanks at its rank will often struggle to fire effectively when on the move or at long ranges. Meanwhile, the Centurion Action X will quickly get in and out of cover thanks to the gun stabilizer, firing whenever enemy targets are spotted.

New players may learn the best way to help your team win the game is by being in the rear supporting the offensive of the most aggressive tanks. Not only covering the fronts but also on the lookout for light flankers.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful high penetrating 20 pdr gun, available with an APDS choice
* Very quick reload time, down to 6.3 seconds per round when in full crew and ace experience
* Has good gun depression and with gun stabilizer like other Centurion
* Slopped upper turret armour, up to 240+ mm thick in some areas

'''Cons:'''

* With only 39 (AB), 35 (RB and SB) km/h top speed, its mobility is mediocre when compared to some contemporary mediums
* Ammo rack in the front like other Centurions
* Small internal compartment (only 4 crew members), easy to knock out with one hit
* Although APDS provides high penetration even in long distances, it provides little post-penetration damage
* Lower turret armour is not reliable sometimes, very thin armour
* No explosive filler on any AP shells

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Development of the Centurion Action X began in the early 1950s. The aim of the project was to improve the Centurion's ballistic protection by fitting the vehicle with the recently developed 'mantletless' turret design. The turret was fitted on a Centurion Mk.7 hull and featured thick, heavily sloped surfaces which further increased its effectiveness.

Furthermore, the vehicle was tested with both the QF 20-pdr as well as the 105 mm L7 cannon. In the end however, only a couple prototypes were built and tested in addition to a few turrets being used separately for ballistic trials. The Centurion Action X never passed the testing stage and was thus also not ordered into production. However, the experience gained during its development, specifically regarding the use of the mantletless turret, was later incorporated into subsequent tank designs such as the FV4202 and the well-known Chieftain main battle tank.
