== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Centurion Mk 2''' was the second variant of the [[Centurion (Family)|Centurion medium tank family]]. The [[Centurion Mk 1]] was widely regarded as a success, but the Soviet tank threat necessitated the development of a more heavily armoured version, known as the Centurion Mk 2. It also possessed a brand-new, completely cast turret. The Centurion Mk 1 was swiftly replaced on the production line, with 800 Centurion Mk 2 ordered in November 1945 from Leyland Motors and Vickers (Elswick), the Royal Ordnance Factories in Leeds and Woolwich. A newly developed two-plane fully automatic stabilization system for the 76 mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder tank gun is also included in the Centurion Mk 2. The Centurion Mk 2 entered service with the 5th Royal Tank Regiment in December 1946. All Centurion Mk 1s and 2s were converted to recovery vehicles or modified to the [[Centurion Mk 3]] standards after production was replaced by the Centurion Mk 3.

Introduced in [[Update 1.55 "Royal Armour"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XI, "Her Majesty's Hussar"]], the premium Centurion Mk 2 is one of the first tanks to include a two-plane fully automatic stabilization system. Players no longer have to worry about opponents appearing around corners and stopping to take aim, making it easier to fire on the move than ever before. Despite aggressive manoeuvring, the gun sights are efficiently stabilized, ensuring that the player always fires first upon spotting an enemy. Other than that, playstyles are comparable to Centurion Mk 1, but players can be significantly more aggressive with Centurion Mk 2, allowing new tactics during combat.
