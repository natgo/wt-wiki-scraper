== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Challenger 2 started development shortly after the introduction of the Challenger 1, since Vickers anticipated that new requirements for a next generation MBT will eventually arrive, when this were sent Vickers immediately submitted their proposal for the Challenger 2. Even when put against other western MBTs like the Leopard 2, Leclerc and M1 Abrams the Challenger 2 was able to complete the test and was found to be a successful proposal. The first Challenger 2 tanks were delivered to the tank regiments by 1994. The Challenger 2 participated in several operations during the '90s and into the 2000s, ranging from peacekeeping missions on the Balkans to military interventions in Iraq. A number of Challenger 2 MBTs have also been exported to Oman, with this nation being the only operator of the Challenger 2, besides the UK. Since 2008 the Challenger 2 has been upgraded with new defensive systems and upgrades to the electronic equipment. 

It was introduced during [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]] as a grand prize for the [[wt:en/news/6286-esport-war-thunder-youtube-cup-results-en|2019 YouTube Cup]]. The Challenger 2 is a very special top-rank main battle tank. It has access to a powerful cannon, but compared to other nations, it does not have access to HEAT ammunition, which makes it a little harder dealing with verylightly armoured vehicles that are more easily destroyed with explosive rounds. The mobility is mediocre, it is a very heavy vehicle and accelerates slowly, turning and changing direction will make you lose a lot of speed. However, your engine is still very powerful, and the top speed is very good at 60 km/h, while the reverse speed is excellent at 38 km/h. The vehicle has a good protection on the turret, however you should avoid exposing your hull, since it lacks composite armour in the lower front plate.

{{main|L37A2 (7.62 mm)|L94A1 (7.62 mm)}}

The Challenger 2 possesses one pintle-mounted 7.62 mm machine gun and one coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun. While these aren't particularly effective against tanks, they can be used as a aircraft deterrent, and lucky shots may result in critical damage or pilot snipes. Besides anti-aircraft fire, they're useful for clearing light obstacles and the crew of open-top vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely accurate main cannon with a fast reload, particularly for a 120 mm; also good gunner optics
* 10° of gun depression is highly useful and also increases the extremely good turret cheek protection
* 36 km/h reverse speed, a far cry from the early poor reverse speed of other British MBTs
* Has ESS, smoke shells and smoke grenades, a potential combat support tank
* Excellent armour protection levels and can get upgraded chemical protection with Dorchester armour pack
* Ammunition on the turret is inert; less vulnerable to overpenetrating shots by APFSDS, like on [[Ariete]]. (NATO tanks with "blowout panel" as [[IPM1]], get sniped through the turret)

'''Cons:'''

* A CR2 with an exposed hull is extremely vulnerable because of the negligible LFP armour
* Cannon mantlet area has unreliable armour; this is the worst weak spot as is impossible to hide while firing
* The frontal turret roof is somewhat vulnerable to chemical rounds when the optics or the machine gun is hit
* Ammunition propellants are strewn inside the vehicle; hull or side penetrations often result in ammo detonation (Avoidable with only 16 shells loaded)
* Sub-par acceleration and top speed relative to many other MBTs
* Prior to mobility upgrades being researched, manual neutral gear selection is required for reasonable hull traverse
