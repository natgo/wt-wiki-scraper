== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Challenger 2 OES is a modification for the tank made to improve its survivability in high intensity battles. With the introduction of ERA blocks covering the sides and front of the vehicle, this protection is meant to deal specially against RPGs and ATGMs in urban combat. The vehicle also received updated protection against IEDs. The upgrade started development based on the Challenger 2 TES, which is almost identical, this upgrade was created as a response to the asymmetric warfare scenario of Iraq 2002, in which IEDs and urban combat doomed many NATO tanks due to their poor protection on the sides. The US developed a similar upgrade with the TUSK ERA package for their M1 Abram tanks.

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], the Challenger 2 OES is very similar to other Challenger 2 tanks. However the increased weight due to the ERA and added composite screens does not include an upgraded engine, which means that the mobility of the Challenger 2 OES is mediocre when compared to earlier Challenger 2s. However, this comes with increased protection against both APFSDS projectiles and ATGMs, the ERA and composite screens are enough to increase the protection against other tanks in critical areas, while they also increase the chances of enemy ATGMs not penetrating the vehicle on the sides of the tank and the turret. However the weak spot in the lower front plate is still present so take that into consideration and hide your hull whenever possible.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->'''The Challenger 2 OES, like its predecessors, is renowned for its exceptional armor protection. The tank features Chobham armor, which is one of the most advanced armor technologies, providing substantial protection against a variety of anti-tank weapons.'''

==== '''Armor Layout''' ====

* '''Frontal Armor: The Challenger 2's frontal armor is its strongest aspect, capable of withstanding direct hits from most contemporary anti-tank rounds. The turret front and glacis plate are particularly well protected.'''
* '''Side and Rear Armor: While the sides are robust, especially compared to earlier tank models, they are still vulnerable to modern anti-tank weapons if exposed. The rear armor is the weakest point, susceptible to all forms of anti-tank weaponry.'''

==== '''Key Weak Areas''' ====

* '''Lower Glacis: This area remains a common weak point in many tanks, including the Challenger 2. Hits here can potentially disable the tank or damage internal components.'''
* '''Rear: The engine and less protected rear aspects make it vulnerable, especially in urban combat scenarios where flanking is possible.'''
* '''Roof: The roof is thinner compared to the frontal and side armor, making it vulnerable to top-attack weapons.'''

==== '''Crew and Module Layout''' ====
'''The Challenger 2 typically houses a crew of four: the commander, gunner, loader, and driver.'''

* '''Driver: Located at the front of the hull, slightly offset to the left.'''
* '''Commander and Gunner: Positioned in the turret with the commander behind and to the right of the gunner.'''
* '''Loader: Also in the turret, positioned on the left side.'''

'''The placement of these crew members, along with critical modules like the ammunition storage and fuel tanks, is strategic. Ammunition is often stored in blow-out compartments to minimize the risk of catastrophic damage if the tank is penetrated.'''

==== '''Evaluation of Protection''' ====

* '''Level of Armor Protection: The Challenger 2’s armor is highly effective against traditional ballistic threats and offers good resistance against improvised explosive devices and mines. However, the tank's protection against newer anti-tank guided missiles and top-attack munitions is a concern that needs continuous upgrades, such as active protection systems.'''
* '''Placement of Modules: The design includes several survivability features, such as the separation and armoring of ammunition storage. This layout helps improve crew survival in the event of a penetration by isolating the explosion to specific compartments.'''

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy.

{{main|L30A1 (120 mm)}}The Challenger 2 OES is equipped with the L30A1 120mm rifled gun. This artillery piece is noted for its distinctive rifling, which enhances the accuracy and stability of its ammunition.

Reloading Speed: The L30A1 has a slower reloading speed compared to modern smoothbore guns found on other main battle tanks. This can affect its ability to deliver rapid successive shots.

Ballistics: The rifled design aids in maintaining a tighter spin on the fired shells, improving their trajectory and accuracy over long distances.

Power of Shells: The gun fires a variety of shells including armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS), high-explosive squash head (HESH), and more. These shells are capable of penetrating modern armor and inflicting significant damage.

Flexibility of Fire: The gun mount and turret provide reasonable agility in targeting. However, the overall speed at which the gun can switch targets and fire is moderated by its mechanical loading system.

Ammunition Types and Usage

The L30A1 uses several types of ammunition:

APFSDS: Ideal for engaging modern armored vehicles at long distances.

HESH: Effective against lighter armored vehicles and for causing internal spalling on heavier armor.

Smoke rounds: Useful for creating smoke screens to cover movements or obscure vision.

Advice on Ammunition Storage and Usage

Ammunition Storage: It is advisable to carry a balanced mix of APFSDS and HESH shells based on the mission profile, with a few smoke rounds for tactical flexibility.

Usage Tips: Utilize APFSDS rounds for long-range engagements against heavily armored targets. Switch to HESH for closer encounters or against buildings and lighter armored vehicles to maximize damage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list.

Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Retains pros from previous challenger 2:
** Impressive chemical protection on the front and sides
** Impressive kinetic protection on either side of the cannon breech, allowing for efficient hull down combat
** Access to unique and powerful HESH round
** Very accurate L30A1 120 mm gun, can even fire HESH accurately at a range of several kilometres
** Fast reload
* Roof mounted machine gun has access to thermal and can be used as a makeshift CITV for scouting (but not firing, unfortunately)
* Access to 12.7 mm machine gun, a rare luxury on British tanks
* Since it is a premium tank, its RP and SL gains are doubled and it can research any British tanks currently in the game

'''Cons:'''

* The jammer is useless in-game and begs other tanks to scout it out or use HE on it
* Heaviest MBT in the game with a very poor hp/ton ratio; very poor acceleration
* Slow turret traverse speed for the BR
* Very poor steering, turning is slow and costs a great deal of speed, which takes a long time to regain
* In most situations, can only reach around 40 km/h (25 mph)
* Also retains weaknesses of previous challenger 2 models:
** Same ammunition options as the previous Challengers
** Frontal armour is weak at the lower frontal plate, drivers port, and cannon breech
** L27A1 has low penetration compared to other top rank NATO ammunition, however reload speed does compensate for this
** Cannot maintain the short reload time after the first-stage ammo rack (4 rounds) has been depleted
