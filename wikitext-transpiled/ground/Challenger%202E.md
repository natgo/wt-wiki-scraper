== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]].

The Challenger 2E is a return to tradition in the Challenger 2 Family, a far more conventional vehicle when compared to the [[Challenger 2 TES]] or the [[Black Night]]. Unlike the other versions of the Challenger 2, it was aimed at the export market, although it failed to receive any orders.

When compared to the other versions of the Challenger 2, it has a substantially more powerful engine, bringing it in-line with many of its international competitors.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Like all Challenger 2 tanks, the armour is exceptional. It is capable of defeating even the most powerful of APFSDS rounds when hull-down, and it can even withstand HEAT rounds to the sides. Nonetheless, it has a few weak spots, particularly the cannon breech and the lower glacis.

The armour profile of the Challenger 2E is practically identical to all other Challenger 2 tanks, so there should be no difficulty in adapting from its predecessors.

Furthermore, the Challenger 2E lacks any additional armour packages, and does not have access to an [[Active protection systems|active protection system]], leaving it marginally more vulnerable than all other Challenger 2 variants.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Challenger 2E has improved mobility when compared to all other Challenger 2 variants. This is due to its superior MTU engine, which replaces the comparatively underpowered Perkins CV12-6A used on all other Challenger 2 tanks.

The MTU engine is about 20% more powerful than the Perkins CV12-6A.

The improved mobility of the Challenger 2E makes it comparable to most other top-tier MBTs, such as the [[Leopard 2A6]] or [[M1A2 SEP]].{{tankMobility|abMinHp=2,325|rbMinHp=1,327}}

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|L30A1 (120 mm)}}

The Challenger 2E mounts the same cannon as all other Challenger 2 tanks in War Thunder. It performs adequately, although some other nations have more capable cannons on their top-tier MBTs. Unlike most MBT cannons at this battle rating, it is rifled. This is to accommodate the HESH ammunition that is highly regarded in British tank doctrine.

The L30A1 is incredibly accurate, although this isn't a unique characteristic for highly rated tanks. The range of ammunition it fires is likewise, good, but nothing special. This is especially damning considering the comparatively limited ammunition selection versus other nation's tanks; the Challenger 2E doesn't have access to HEATFS, HE-VT, or ATGM ammunition.

Where it really shines, however, is it's immense rate of fire. The Challenger 2E - like its predecessors - share the joint title of the fastest 120 mm non-autoloading cannon in War Thunder. The Challenger 2E has one of the fastest firing cannons of any top-tier tank, and can deal out damage at a near absurd rate. With an untrained crew, it has a reload time of 6.5 seconds, however this drops down to an astonishing 5 seconds with an aced crew, lending it a fire rate of 12 rounds per minute.

{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|L94A1 (7.62 mm)}}

The Challenger 2E has access to one 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun, and one 12.7 mm machine gun mounted on the roof. All other Challenger 2 tanks lack a high calibre machine gun, giving this tank increased lethality against enemy aircraft and light vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->The Challenger 2E should be used in a near-identical fashion to the other Challenger 2 tanks.

That is to say:

* Remain at long-range
* Lock down enemy advances
* Stay hull-down
* Do not rush in, play patiently
* If advancing, stick with the team

Although, the Challenger 2E has substantially improved mobility, so it can be used more aggressively. Players are at liberty to decide how they control this tank far more than its other iterations. However, one must be aware of their positioning relative to the team. Stray too far ahead with that great engine power, and you risk over-extending and becoming isolated, only to be swarmed by enemy tanks.

Nonetheless, this is still ill-advised. The Challenger 2E has an advantage over most enemies at long-range. While the tank can be used aggressively, this throws away the advantage. While it doesn't put you at substantially increased risk, you are not as capable as you could be.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The Challenger 2E was a private venture by [[wikipedia:Vickers_plc|Vickers plc]], aimed at the export market. The 2E was designed after the failure of the Challenger 2 to gain international sales, with only 38 being sold.

The Challenger 2E was marketed as being a high-end and capable tank that would outperform all competition, unlike the budget series of the [[Vickers MBT (Family)|Vickers family]]. The primary target for the 2E was the gulf nations, as well as several Mediterranean nations. Adjustments were made to the basic Challenger 2 to accommodate these potential markets, such as native integration of air filtration and air conditioning.

Additionally, space was freed up in the crew compartment to accommodate an internal toilet, one of the only tanks in history to do so.

Unfortunately for Vickers, the Challenger 2E was a failure, and did not attract any orders. This was one of many contributing factors that led Vickers plc to go under, eventually being folded into BAE Systems.

One reason for the failure of the Challenger 2E was the reluctance of the British government to sell the Challenger 2E to foreign countries, due to the immensely classified nature of its Chobham armour profile. Were relations to sour between Britain and the prospective buyer, or were the Challenger 2E to be captured by an enemy state, the exact armour profile of the Challenger 2 could be calculated - and perhaps even reverse engineered.

This was especially concerning given the sheer number of tanks using Chobham armour - not only d

Additionally, the Challenger 2E performed rather poorly in the 1998 Greek tank trials, irreparably damaging its reputation.

By 2005, the Challenger 2E project was entirely abandoned by BAE systems.
