== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Overall, the armour on the Challenger DS is exactly the same as the tech tree counterpart, the [[Challenger Mk.3]]. However, it lacks the additional ROMOR ERA and the sides armour package. It gets a slight but negligible upgrade on the lower frontal plate compared to the [[Challenger Mk.2]] as it has spare tracks strapped on the LFP. While it is a Challenger Mk.3, it is most comparable to the Challenger Mk.2 in terms of armour. The upper half of the turret cheeks are capable of withstanding almost all kinetic penetrators and will stop most chemical projectiles with less than 800 mm penetration, while the lower half won't protect against most top-rank rounds. The hull composite is only good against lower penetrating APFSDS rounds such as [[T-55AM-1|T-55AM]], and can also withstand some chemical munitions, but it is not advised to rely on this armour. The rest of the tank (turret and hull sides, lower front plate) has decent protection against chemical rounds due to the add on armour, ERA, and thick turret sides.

<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)

* Side skirts consist of 150 mm NERA composite, 70 mm composite screens, or 19 mm aluminium.
* Tracks and wheels are 20 mm thick.
* Sandbags are just decorative.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
While it is slower than Western MBTs at its BR, it is not a slow platform. It holds a fast top speed for both forward and reverse. Despite being a heavy vehicle, the brake distance is surprisingly low, between 20-30 m at top speed. It has the ability to do neutral steering relatively fast and, since it comes with all upgrades, it immediately gets the tracks modification which significantly improve this ability. It has little to medium impact when crossing muddy terrain, wet and snowy terrain, but nothing that impacts performance significantly. Thanks to not having the additional armour package, the cross-country capabilities of the Challenger DS are significantly increased, being able to easily traverse and cross over long trenches, deep craters and through steep terrains up to a certain level.

{{main|L11A5 (120 mm)}}
The Challenger bears the 120 mm L11A5, an updated but essentially identical version of the gun found on the Chieftains. It keeps the same ammunition as the Challenger Mk.2 and previous Chieftain Mk.10, making the ballistic performance identical. The L23 comes as the stock round with a significant armour penetration at the cost of reduced penetration angle. L23A1 has much better angle penetration at the cost of reduced armour penetration.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Short reload time
* Can be hard to penetrate hull down
* Has a great reverse gear

'''Cons:'''

* Only 4 shells in the ready rack
* Heavy tank
* Driver's optic are huge which makes it a huge weak spot
* Can be easily ammoracked
* Sides are riddled with fuel tanks which makes it prone to catch fire from enemy shells

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
After the introduction of Challenger in 1983 as the new MBT for the British Army in different units, there were debates on its reliability due to its inferior overall performance in Canadian Army Trophy of 1987. As the Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990 and the subsequent Operation Sand Storm (Gulf War) began in 1991, the Challengers were given the chance to show their own worth.

The British Army deployed the 1st Armoured Division to the Middle East alongside with 3 armoured brigades with Challenger tanks, some even with the latest Mk.3 series with new ERA packages installed in Saudi Arabia by late 1990. After the deadline for complete withdrawn of Iraqi forces passed, the coalition started the assault by 17th January, 1991 where the Challengers destroyed and captured hundreds of Iraqi tanks (ie. [[T-55A]], [[Type 69-IIa]]) while received no loss from enemy fire. Operation Desert Storm was where the Challenger held the world record of the longest tank-to-tank kill done by the callsign of 11B from the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, achieving a destruction at around 5.1 km away on 26th February, 1991.

The delivery of Challenger DS belongs to a tank with a callsign Zero Charlie (ØC; the Ø is in fact a slashed zero [0] instead of the oe sound in IPA) of A Squadron to an unknown unit in British Army.
