== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened as '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a Rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 "The Valkyries"]].

The Char 25t is similar to other French light tanks in that it is a small, closed tank with a compact autoloader turret in the rear of the tank. It is a bit wider than traditional French lights, but not by much. Its armour design is more akin to the AMX-50 or the Panther with a flat front and angled cheeks on the chassis. On the top of the turret is an oddity for cold war French designs, a machine gun. Though only a 7.5 mm machine gun that can be used for spotting targets or to deter some planes along with the coaxial.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} has more armour than other French light tanks, at steeper angles. With distance, it may be able to bounce the 40 mm Bofors, though it will be rare. The top of the tank is well armoured and will easily defeat .50 cal (12.7 mm) rounds from airborne enemies though anything bigger will go through. The sides and rear are nonexistent comparatively and anything "antitank" will go through with ease. Most APHE shells fired at thinner parts of the tank may fail to detonate inside, it may save your life once or twice but don't rely on it. The driver has a 50 mm plate in front of him so that will help once or twice. The engine may also block poorly-aimed shots.

'''Armour type:'''

- Cast homogeneous armour (hull cheeks, turret base, turret, cupola)
- Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof, cupola roof)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 775|rbMinHp= 442}}

The {{PAGENAME}} is very fast, both in top speed (even in reverse) and acceleration. With a top speed of 65 km/h and great horsepower to weight ratio, it will conquer most terrain you put it through. The wide tracks compared to its low weight are just another cherry on top. The transmission has 12 gears, 6 forward and 6 backward, and then a neutral. The reverse gears are identical to the forward gears, so driving in reverse is no problem (except for the more exposed crew). Also, the {{PAGENAME}} can neutral steer and does so rather quickly.

{{main|D.911 APX (90 mm)}}

The gun is decent for its BR and role. Although it lacks a HEATFS shell like another vehicle near its BR, the AMX-13-90, the Char 25t carries the M82 APCBC and T33 APBC rounds.

The reload time is short, 6.7 seconds between shots (even with a knocked out loader). It carries 7 shots in the drum, like the AMX M4, allowing for a sustained fire at multiple enemies. Although great at post-penetration damage, the M82 round used by the Char 25t has mediocre penetration for its BR, especially when taking into account the presence of HEATFS and APDS rounds.

Notes:

- Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
- Rack 6 (autoloader magazine) is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 7 shells.
  ** This racks get filled first when loading up the tank and is also emptied first.
  ** As it is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
  ** Once the autoloader magazine has been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.
  ** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 5 into rack 6. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
  \*\* The depletion order at full capacity is: 6 - 1 - 2 up to 5.

The small calibre of the MAC 31 machine guns makes them largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. They still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Char 25t is a very fast tank with little protection so engaging enemy tanks frontally is ill-advised. Thanks to its good mobility and a reversible gearbox that enables to disengage just as swiftly, it can resort to flanking to perform in combat. The Char 25t can engage all but the heaviest (e.g. IS-3) targets at close range and it can reliably engage targets from the side at range. However, remember that you are in a light tank so make sure not to be in the enemy's direct line of fire. Your engine may absorb a hit or two, but do not rely on it for survival.

The following tactics could be used proficiently with the Char 25t:

'''Long range sniper/flanker'''

Start off the match by heading for one of the flanks. If it's an open map, hide behind hills and passively scout as you drive or head for the outermost capture point. Be wary of the speedy M18 tank destroyers, any of the Sd.Kfz. 234 series, or any other quick tanks that may be trying the same thing as you. Once in a nice position (shadow cover, somewhere to retreat, nice sight lanes), sit and wait for someone to pass by. Don't stay tunnel visioned! Slower tanks may be approaching and they will be able to instantly destroy the Char 25t if it gets the chance. If you notice enemies at a far distance, first scout them using the scout key so your team knows where they are in case you miss or are destroyed. Next, either range-find, or just go for the shot if they are close enough. Neutralize the target, and either change position and then rinse and repeat.

'''Brawler'''

Surprisingly, this tank makes a decent brawler with its compact size, incredible speed, and great reload rate. Keep near the outer flanks of any main road or capture point, and drive around looking to shoot out engines/turrets. Try not to engage any heavier tank frontally, as you will be wiped out quite quickly, and you will rarely penetrate through their frontal armour. If you manage to get the first shot, you will have the superior reload for the follow-up shot, especially if their gunner is knocked out from the first shot. Be wary though, and assume the enemy always has a shot loaded, so either be prepared to go back into cover if they're gunner gets replaced.

'''Support'''

With light tanks repair mechanics, the Char 25t can help repair teammates if a friendly repair has been initiated. Stick with your teammates, especially heavier ones like the T95 or Maus which may occasionally meet. When they engage in a firefight, either flank around the enemy to disable their gun/movement, or if your teammate already finished off the enemy and is repairing, help them. Go around and help your teammates repair and disable/destroy enemies.

'''Mixed'''

Mix and match the tactics above and of other French lights. Try to flank and don't get destroyed. The roof machine gun can allow the Char 25t to harass planes trying for a ground strike at the team, so there's always a role that the Char 25t can play as.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Low profile.
- Thin armour will sometimes cause APHE to penetrate straight through without detonating.
- Frontally-placed engine may absorb some shots
- Has smoke launchers (high arc of fire).
- Can reach its top speed quite fast.
- Reversible gearbox (same speed in both directions)
- The addition of the M82 round increases the tank's effectiveness.
- Fast turret rotation.
- Good gun depression value: high gun placement make hull-down positions very efficient.
- Short reload time thanks to the 7-round autoloader: 1 shot every 6.7 seconds, comparable to reload times at low ranks.
- Has scouting ability and teammate repair/firefighting function.

'''Cons:'''

- Thin sides will get shredded easily by nearby SPAAs.
- Bad at stop-and-shoot due to oscillating turret design.
- Gun penetration rates are subpar at longer ranges: relies heavily on flanking manoeuvres.
- Poor gun elevation angle of 11 degrees.
- Ammo is stored everywhere, a single penetrating shot can easily cause an ammo rack detonation.
- Restocking the autoloader is very slow once it has been depleted and severely degrades combat performance.

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

===Design===
The Batignolles-Châtillon 25t or project Super AMX-13 was designed in the 1950s for a weight class twice bigger than the AMX-13. It reused many parts from the AMX-13 like the oscillating turret and the autoloader. Its primary armament was a 90mm cannon capable of shooting the same ammunition as US M47 and M48 tanks. It was equipped with a 500 HP engine and could reach 65 km/h. It was operated by 4 crew members.

===Development===
Two prototypes were made in 1954 before the project was abandoned. The hurdles of the concept were the impossibility to guarantee NBC protection on the oscillating turret, the external reload of the autoloader exposing the crew during combat, an unreliable hydraulic suspension and external shot traps on the turret. Proofs of concept and technologies developed in this program were however later reused on other French tank projects, especially the AMX-30 (transmission).

===Combat usage===
As a prototype vehicle, Char 25t never saw service or combat action in the French Army.
