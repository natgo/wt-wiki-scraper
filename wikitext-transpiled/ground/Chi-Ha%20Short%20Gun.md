== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features.

The '''{{Specs|name}} / Short 12cm SPG''' ({{Annotation|短十二糎自走砲|Tan-Jūni Senchimētoru Ji Hashi-Hō}}) is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]]. The {{Specs|name}} was made available as a pre-order [[wt:en/news/4379-japanese-pre-order-packs-en|premium pack]] as Type 97 Chi-Ha 12cm for the release of the Japanese ground tree.

The {{PAGENAME}} is a Naval refit of the [[Chi-Ha Kai]] with a [[Navy short gun (120 mm)]], it keeps the mobility from the [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Chi-Ha]] chassis but loses the turret rotation speed due the added weight of the gun. The {{PAGENAME}} is a later iteration of the [[Chi-Ha]] with a modified turret coming from the [[Chi-Ha Kai]] which was made to support navy infantry as a gun tank during the defense of the homeland.

The Type 97 [[Chi-Ha]] is an upgraded version of the earlier Type 89 [[I-Go Ko]]. The engine has been upgraded, from the Mitsubishi A6120VD air-cooled straight-six diesel with 120 hp to a Mitsubishi SA12200VD air-cooled V12 diesel with 170 hp. As such, the top speed has increased from 27 km/h on the [[I-Go Ko]] to 40 km/h on the [[Chi-Ha]].

{{main|Navy short gun (120 mm)}}

The 120 mm Navy short gun is built to deal with submarines and close range naval combat, and that does translate over in-game as a gun that have a very low muzzle velocity, which on the bright side can be used to shoot at vehicles over cover.

The gun can only fire an HE round by default. However, the shell contains 2.64 kg of TNT equivalent, which is enough to cause a lethal overpressure damage against almost any enemy the tank has to face at its BR.

While the shell is certainly powerful, it is not as powerful as the [[Ho-Ro]]'s 150 mm howitzer rounds. This means careful aim is still needed when facing a more well-armoured opponents. Against these targets, aim at any deflective angles that can cause the explosion effect to deflect on the weak hull roof.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

Because the {{PAGENAME}} was designed for an infantry support role, its performance shows how tank combat wasn't put in mind for the vehicle. With awfully slow turret traverse and poor shell trajectory harming the tank's combat effectiveness. However, with each shell having 2.64 kg of TNT equivalent of explosives, it can easily deal overpressure damage against most tank it will face.

Most lightly-armoured vehicles and tanks with less than 30 mm of armour will be able to be destroyed from crew knock-out wherever you hit them. But when you start opposing medium to heavy tanks, you should fall back for friendlies to deal with the target. It might be possible fire a shot to deal overpressure damage against weak hull roof, but it's a tricky shot and won't always deal a fatal blow on first hit.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Familiar [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Chi-Ha]] chassis
* {{Annotation|Ten-seconds|10.6s Expert; 10.0s Ace}} reload with a 120 mm cannon
* Huge explosive mass for 120 mm HE shell means it can destroy every tank it faces via overpressure
* Five crew members

'''Cons:'''

* Slow reload compared to cannons commonly met at this BR (37 to 75 mm)
* Only fires high explosive rounds
* As the shell is much less effective than the 150 mm howitzers, it requires some knowledge for where to aim on enemy's tanks to cause overpressure effect
* Poor turret traverse, just 5.1°/s
* Very slow muzzle velocity (290 m/s) causes large shell drop

== History ==
<!-- Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History) and add a link to it here using the main template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <ref></ref>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <references />. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under === In-game description ===, also if applicable). -->
{{main|Chi-Ha (Family)|l1=History of the Type 97 Chi-Ha}}

=== Development ===
The {{PAGENAME}}, designated the ''Short 12 cm Self-propelled artillery'' ({{Annotation|短十 二糎 自走砲|Tan Jū ni-senchimētoru Jisōhō}}) was a navy refit of the [[Chi-Ha Kai|Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai]] to make a similar gun tank as the Army's [[Ho-I|Type 2 Ho-I]] with greater firepower to support the Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF).

To get greater firepower than the Type 2 Ho-I, a naval short barrel 120 mm was chosen with an additional bespoke muzzle brake, the official designation of this 120 mm gun is unclear but may greatly be the [[wikipedia:12_cm/12_short_naval_gun?|12cm/12 short naval gun]]. Additionally, there was a small storage compartment added onto the back of the ShinHoTo Chi-Ha turret.

=== Combat usage ===
The only certain information on this variant is that only a dozen or so vehicles were built and all were assigned to the Yokosuka No. 16 Special Land Battle Corps. The Chi-Ha's weren't the only vehicles assigned to this squadron and saw service next to the Type 2 [[Ka-Mi]] and Type 3 [[Ka-Chi]] amphibious tanks.

These vehicles would most likely have seen service in defense of the homeland next to the SNLF infantry. But in-case that these tanks would be required to move to forward islands, they would most likely be transport by [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft]]'s just like the infantry accompanied and escorted by the Amphibious tanks during landings.

There's only a handful of images of Chi-Ha 120 mm, all being American and taken at the naval yard in Sasebo, Japan, October 1945. None of the vehicles survive today.
