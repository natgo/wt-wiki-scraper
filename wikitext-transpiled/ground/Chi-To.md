== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|四式中戦車 「チト」|Yon-Shiki Chū-Sensha [Chi-To]}}) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].

The Type 4 Chi-To looks similar to the [[Chi-Nu|Type 3 Chi-Nu]], though with a longer chassis with an extra wheel. Turret is also similar in look, though the turret side is more smooth and has a machine gun sticking out the right side. The big differences on the turret is the gun barrel. The gun barrel has no muzzle brake in its design and the recoil tube has been moved from a single tube on the bottom to two tubes on top.

Playing the Type 4 Chi-To can give the player a new impression of the Japanese tree line and a lasting one considering many of the Japanese tanks after it follow the same pattern. A tank with a very powerful cannon, decent mobility, but rather terrible armour. The terrible armour plus the tank's rather long reload means that the Chi-To is meant more for a long-distance shoot out than a close encounter.

As previously stated, the Chi-To best performs in the role of sniper, engaging hulldown at medium to long range against opposing medium tanks. The good gun depression, average mobility, and good reverse speed allow you to make it to good positions at an average pace and allow you to reverse back into cover when reloading.

Against most heavies such as the [[IS-1]]/[[IS-2|2]], [[Tiger H1|Tiger]], or [[Panther D|Panther]], it is only worthwhile to engage if you are already entrenched in a solid defensive position. Your gun's lack of APCBC gives you poor performance against slopes and rounded armour on the IS, Panther, and angled Tigers, making any ranged engagement near useless. Against tanks such as the [[M4A3E2|Jumbo 75]] or [[M4A3E2 (76) W|76]], it is best to disengage and flank them or have teammates flank them. Against all other medium tanks, shots to the hull will suffice at most range.

The M4A3E2 Jumbo could be a menace if not handled properly as they are nigh impenetrable from the front due to its thick armour. Either try for a very precise shot through the MG port in the front or shoot the armour behind the tracks if they are angled. The best way to deal with a Sherman Jumbo is to shoot it through the side or between the side plate and the tracks. There is a small gap between the top of the tracks and the bottom of the side plate that can be easily penetrated by the Chi-To Late, and a successful penetration here usually results in a one-shot, or a destroyed/alight engine. This weak spot is relatively easy to exploit as most Jumbo drivers make the mistake of angling their armour, which gives you full view of this weak spot. If you are struggling to hit it, then a shot through the drive wheel at an angle of 45º or more usually works quite well also. You should feel no pressure to get this right the first time, as a well-angled Chi-To Late can reliably bounce the Jumbo's shells, unless the Jumbo in question happens to be sporting the 76mm M1A1 cannon.

The IS series of tanks can also be a bit of a bother to deal with. At this battle rating, you may find the IS-1, IS-2 or IS-2 mod. 1944 (rare). However, they can be defeated by exploiting the shot trap on the turret front (requires some luck), shooting the driver's hatch on the front or the gun mantlet (requires extreme precision and luck), shooting the lower frontal plate (the most reliable way to kill an IS) or shooting the frontal armour plate from a 90º angle. That being said, your tank can still one-shot the IS series you'll face by shooting directly beneath the turret ring.

You may encounter the German "Big Cat" tanks (Tiger H1, Tiger E, Panther D, Panther A) if you get seriously up tiered. In this case the best thing you can do is hit them from the side, which usually results in a one-shot. If facing a Tiger (or any German Big Cat for that matter) from the front, you should retreat. However, if his frontal plate is not angled, then it might be worth a shot to shoot between the machine gun port and driver's hatch, which will result in a one-shot. As for the panther, try to exploit the shot trap on the turret, but only as a last resort. Your first port of call should be to shoot the drive wheel, basically following the same tactics you'd use for dealing with a Sherman Jumbo.

As for some other enemies:

* [[Churchill VII]]: do not engage from the front at all. Sneak around to the side and shoot there.
* [[ARL-44]]: shoot the sides. It's not worth facing this tank head on, it's too much of a risk.
* [[ARL-44 (ACL-1)]]: aim for the turret if you face this tank from the front, then finish it from the sides. Be careful not to get shot.
* [[M6A1]]: the frontal armour on this thing can be a bit fiddly. Aim for a spot that doesn't seem to have more than one armour plate layered on it.

Most tanks you face can penetrate you frontally if they shoot your frontal plate when it is not angled. It is recommended to get the first shot off and then retreat, and make a second surprise attack. Most of the time, a penetration results in a one-shot with this tank. You can penetrate pretty much any medium or light tank frontally by shooting the upper front plate, so use that to your advantage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 75 mm cannon rivaling the [[T-34-85|T-34-85's]], good penetration and very low shell drop-off.
* APHE round can easily defeat enemy tanks.
* A very powerful tank at 4.3, can tackle all foes at its BR bracket.
* Decent gun depression of -11°
* Ammo in the turret can be emptied by carrying 15 less ammo.
* Very powerful Type 4 Kou shell with more penetration and more explosive filler.
* Decent top armour, enough to resist strafing aircraft weapons.

'''Cons:'''

* Armour is average and mostly flat and unangled, like the Panzer IV.
* The Chi-To is asymmetric and is a large tank, it is difficult to hide from enemies.
* Reload rate quite slow.
* Angling front armour can expose the 50 mm hull cheek armour.
* Very hard to turn on the spot, especially when stock.
* Mediocre acceleration compared to other tanks in its BR.

===Development===
The lackluster performance of Japanese tanks in World War II called for the development of newer medium tanks in the Imperial Japanese Army. The standard tank of the time was the [[Chi-Ha|Type 97 Chi-Ha]], which has its chassis used in many expedient models to provide a bigger gun for the Japanese inventory such as the [[Chi-Ha Kai|Chi-Ha Kai]], [[Chi-He|Type 1 Chi-He]], [[Ho-I|Type 2 Ho-I]], and [[Chi-Nu|Type 3 Chi-Nu]]. By the time of Chi-Nu, however, the Chi-Ha chassis was becoming outdated and so a new tank design using an improved chassis was needed for future development.<ref name="ZalogaJapaneseTank">Zaloga Steven. ''Japanese Tanks 1939-1945'' Great Britain: Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2007</ref>

In 1943, development started of the '''Chi-To''' tank, which features a new chassis and more powerful engine. Its armament is a 75 mm gun based off the Type 88 anti-aircraft gun, giving it a high-velocity weapon. Armour on the tank was welded and was quite thick in comparison to its predecessor at 75 mm thick. The tank was accepted for service in 1944 and was expected to enter mass production with 20 per month at Mitsubishi and 5 per month at Kobe-Seiko. In terms of Japanese armour development, the Chi-To was the most sophisticated tank to enter production levels.<ref name="ZalogaJapaneseTank" />

===War's End===
Despite its potential, the Type 4 Chi-To was never made in large numbers. At the war's end, only six chassis were made, with only two of those made into tanks.

The two Type 4 produced were cast into Lake Hamana between the 23 and the 28 August 1945 to avoid their capture. One was found by the U.S. occupation forces following Japan's surrender in World War II. The tank was then transported to Aberdeen Proving Grounds for tests and would eventually scrap them in October 1952.<ref name="MaiScrapping">Sun, Eun Ae. ''Chi-Ri & Chi-To: Aberdeen Tank Scrapping.'' YouTube, YouTube, 7 Aug. 2017, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mkS8EodQbA Video]</ref>

The second tank is still believed to be at the bottom of the lake. A project to find it was launched in 2013 by SM@Pe, a group of people from Hamamatsu. Inhabitants, volunteers, divers and the Windy Network Corp ( a marine studies company from Tôkyô  who founded a trainning plane of the Japanese imperial army in the lake Towada in 2010) participated to research, supported by the use of a sonar and testimonials, including former soldiers who allegedly participated in the launching operation. The research did not give anything.
