== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was an upgrade package for the [[Strv 121]] to meet the standards of the [[Strv 122]]. However, due to the Defence Act 2004, most [[Strv 121]]s were already in storage since the 2000s due to the widespread adoption of the [[Strv 122]], which rendered the upgrade package obsolete. The upgrade project was abandoned with only one prototype made to this standard. The {{PAGENAME}}'s upgrade was mostly notable in receiving the Galix smoke launcher system, improved electrical components to the turret enhancing overall performance, a reversing camera, and improvements to the maintenance of the vehicle which streamlined vehicle upkeep.

Introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' bolsters the Swedish line with a good all-around vehicle for players to grind with. Due to its similarity to the [[Strv 121]] and other [[Leopard 2 (Family)|Leopard 2]]s, experienced players find it familiar to use, but newer players may struggle to adapt to the gameplay dynamic of the higher tiers. The {{PAGENAME}} is an excellent all-round vehicle, with the mobility to get to desired locations on the map with ease. The 120 mm cannon has excellent firepower to deal with most other MBTs, but still needs to take care in aiming for the weaker parts of armour, as the penetration can be a bit lacking for more well-protected targets. The {{PAGENAME}} is best used in positions where its hull is not exposed to hostile fire; the strongest part of the vehicle is its turret which can survive being hit better than the hull, so using surrounding terrain to its advantage to peek and fire then get back into cover will improve the gameplay of the vehicle. However, even if there is no sufficient cover for the vehicle, it can still put up an fight and do well.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The strv 121's kinetic protection is reasonable, with the turret cheeks near-invulnerable to all but the most powerful rounds and the upper front plate capable of protecting against less powerful rounds - however besides these sections the remainder of the vehicle is largely vulnerable to high-powered kinetic rounds; of note are the weak lower front plate and the gun mantlet, both of which are reasonably visible targets, as well as the gunner's optics.

The vehicle sports significantly better all-round chemical protection, with an upper hull and turret essentially immune to all but the most powerful ATGMs frontally, with upwards of 800mm worth of equivalent protection in places. Despite this, it's advisable to be wary of incoming ATGMs as a well-placed round may sneak past the heavily protected areas - and some missiles such as those of the ADATS will slice straight through even the turret cheeks.

As with most other MBTs, the strv is particularly vulnerable from the sides and back.

The strv 121b is reasonably survivable, with some degree of crew spacing. However, from certain angles, the crew are placed in a straight line and successful penetration may impact three of the four crew members, resulting in a crew knock-out. In addition, well-placed side shots may impact all three turret crew members.

Ammunition is stored in the primary ammunition storage in the rear of the turret, or in the secondary storage next to the driver. The primary rack provides crew protection through the use of blow-out panels, however only has space for 15 rounds. When more than 16 rounds are taken to battle, ammunition will be stored in the significantly more vulnerable hull rack, which is positioned in the front of the hull where most people generally aim.

The 121's protection proves acceptable for long-range combat, although it's ill-advised to remain in one location for any extended period of time to avoid opposing vehicles being able to hone their shots onto your weak spots. The 121's protection should not be relied upon in urban or other close-range environments.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull sides, rear, and roof, turret sides, rear, and roof)
* High hardness rolled armour (hull front, turret front, gun mantlet)
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet frame)
* Composite screen (front side skirts)
* Structural steel (rear side skirts)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} is powered by an MTU MB 873 Ka-501 engine which produces a whopping 1,500 hp (1,100 KW), resulting in a power-to-weight ratio of slightly over 27 hp per tonne, compared to the ratio of the early Abrams and identical to the T-80U. As such, the {{PAGENAME}} is quite mobile despite weighing over 55 tonnes, comfortably able to reach 72 km/h on-road and well capable of keeping up with its competitors. This allows for an active, aggressive playstyle, using the tank's high speed and good acceleration characteristics to get into an early flanking position or take early cap points - though it is important to keep in mind that opposition forces might attempt the same.

The {{PAGENAME}} has a maximum reverse speed of 31 km/h which it reaches easily, allowing for a quick retreat in sub-optimal situations.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|kan Strv 121 (120 mm)}}

The famous Rheinmetall L/44 120 mm cannon is mounted as the primary armament on the strv 121, offering a balance of firepower, accuracy and sustained rate of fire. The 121 has three rounds available to it: slsgr m/95 , DM13 and DM23 a tier 4 modification. The L/44 is reasonably accurate at long range with any ammunition, however minor round deviation may be evident at extreme ranges (over 2,000 m).

It's advisable to primarily rely on the best available APFSDS round for engaging other MBTs, however, retaining a couple of slsgr m/95 rounds can prove valuable against lighter vehicles such as the ADATS.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The strv 121B can be used comfortably in both urban and rural environments, providing the vehicle's weaknesses are kept in mind (the sides and hull). While it is capable in most forms of engagement, it does lack the precision of the British Challenger MBTs or the extreme round velocities of the Soviet T-64/T-80 series. The 121B also has a particularly large and blocky profile, making for a particularly visible target in many situations.

Considering the above, a strv 121B player should utilise its great mobility and competitive gun to get into early positions to pick off unsuspecting targets, rather than attempting to engage opposing forces head-on.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful engine, high top speed and acceleration
* Good neutral steering system
* Good gunner sight magnification for long-range engagements
* Reasonably high-velocity kinetic rounds
* Competent DM23 APFSDS
* Turret armour is mostly effective for hull-down engagements
* Primary ammunition is contained within a storage unit with blow-out panels
* Generation 1 thermals in the gunner sight

'''Cons:'''

* Hull armour is mediocre, particularly against kinetic rounds
* The gunner's optics are a weak spot, enemies who know how to aim can cripple your gun and kill your crew
* The gun mantlet is relatively weak while being quite prominent, penetration can disable the gun or knock turret crew out
* The turret cheeks can be penetrated by most APFSDS rounds when hit at the right angle
* Secondary ammunition storage is extremely vulnerable, although this is avoidable by carrying no more than 16 rounds
* Both machine guns are relatively light calibre, suffer from mediocre gun elevation and will not prove to be much more an annoyance to aircraft, particularly helicopters
* Blowout panels are unreliable and have a low capacity
