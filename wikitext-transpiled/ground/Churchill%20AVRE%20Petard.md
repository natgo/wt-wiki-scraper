== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The {{Specs|name}}, officially the "Mortar, Recoiling, Spigot, 29mm, Mk I", was the first vehicle to bear the name "AVRE" (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineer) as a breakthrough tank for the British Army's Royal Engineers. The 1942 Dieppe Raid revealed a dire need for a vehicle that could assist in breaching extensive bunker/pillbox defences, particularly when attempting to break through enemy lines from new beachheads. This vehicle would serve as a mobile cover for Royal Engineers while operating in the battlefield. After evaluations of several tanks, the Churchill infantry tank became the chosen vehicle for this mission. Aside from some components being replaced by engineering supplies and having larger side doors for infantry operation, a new 29 mm spigot mortar, dubbed the "flying dustbin", was also installed in the turret to launch ranged demolition charges without having to leave the vehicle during crossfire. After trials in 1943, the new vehicle, now known as the Churchill AVRE, was ready for service and proved very successful during the breakthrough stage in the Normandy Landings in June 1944. The 79th Armoured Division, with their "Hobart's Funnies" vehicles, successfully provided reliable support for the first wave of assault groups. The AVRE name would also be retained for all new vehicles designed for these purposes, including the [[Centurion Mk.5 AVRE]] which was still in service during the Gulf War of the 1990s.

Introduced during [[Update "Alpha Strike"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8912-event-earn-the-churchill-avre-in-the-operation-overlord-event-en|2024 Operation Overlord event]], the Churchill AVRE plays similarly to the German [[38 cm Sturmmörser|Sturmtiger]], as instead of a cannon it has a 230 mm Petard mortar, which launches huge 18 kg projectiles. However, such a weapon requires special skill: aiming is not easy due to the low initial velocity of the projectile. For the same reason, the effective range of the mortar's flight does not exceed 100 metres, so the Churchill AVRE is effective only at short combat distances, such as in urban areas. The outstanding protection of the Churchill will be very useful to get close enough to enemy vehicles, allowing it to survive several hits. However, it should be noted that the gun has a long reload time, and the loaded shell in the barrel can be easily detonated with even machine gun fire.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Churchill AVRE's protection is identical to that of a baseline [[Churchill III]]. For its rank, the Churchill has relatively reliable protection thanks to its true identity - a heavy tank (although officially an infantry tank). However, remember that "reliable" does not equate to "invincible"; there are still some cannons that can penetrate the III series, for example, the Soviet F-34 and German Kwk 42, as well as US 3-inch guns. In most cases, if their shot lands on sloped parts of the hull, the AVRE will very unlikely be harmed at all. Be sure to keep the flanks clear, even if this means being less aggressive than one would normally indulge with the Churchill series to avoid being overwhelmed while reloading.

As for the crew and internal compartments, the overall layout is mostly identical to a Churchill III, but the major difference lies in the remaining demolition charges stored inside the vehicle. While the sufficiently spacious interior might mitigate some damage, a direct hit on those charges will certainly blow the turret to the height of Big Ben. Therefore, pointing the hull at oncoming fire is essential for the Churchill AVRE's service.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Churchill III uses the same engine as any previous or later production of the Churchill series, namely the Belford "Flat Twelve" 12-cylinder, horizontal petrol engine. Although it can drive the vehicle, it will never be the first to hit the frontline due to its rather slow acceleration and a top speed of 24 km/h.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|Petard (230 mm)}}

The 29 mm of the tank's designation refers to the spigot (the tube that the ammunition is inserted onto); the ammunition itself is 230 mm and known as the "Petard", or commonly as the "flying dustbin" referring to its dustbin-like appearance. With around 17.8 kg of TNT explosive charge, a single hit can demolish most, if not all, targets the AVRE will face at its tier. Be careful of its rather long reload time (reloaded by the driver from an overhead hatch into the barrel) and damage to the ammunition itself, even from machine gun fire.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Huge explosive filler in mortar shell can obliterate anything it touches, even above its BR
* Due to curved arc of the mortar, it can be easily lobbed over obstacles or terrain to hit target hiding behind them
* Extremely thick armour, especially for its BR

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely terrible shell velocity; cannot shoot further than 10 meters in a straight line, and has a maximum range of only 150 meters
* Being a mortar shell, the shell takes very long time to lob and descend onto the target if shooting at range, making it very difficult to hit moving targets
* Due to very limited range of the mortar, the tank struggle to perform in open terrain where virtually all enemies can outrange it
* Mortar shell can be detonated inside the barrel, potentially causing lethal damage
* Very poor top speed and mobility, highly vulnerable to airstrike
