== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season IX, "Smell of Victory"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Churchill Crocodile is not too different from the [[Churchill VII]], being a modified version with a flamethrower weapon in the bow gunner position.

The flamethrower is useful against open-topped vehicle, but otherwise the Churchill Crocodile's offensive capabilities remain the same as the Churchill VII with the 75 mm gun. Due to the 75 mm's low penetration and situational use of the flamethrower, it is recommended to work and rely on teammates to help destroy the enemy.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Access to a flamethrower, effective against open topped vehicles
- Same tough armour of the Churchill VII

'''Cons:'''

- Flamethrower fuel is vulnerable to being shot
- Inadequate 75 mm gun, same as the one on the Churchill VII
- Slow reverse speed

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
