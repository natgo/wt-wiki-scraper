== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Following the battle experiences in North Africa, there was a need among Churchill tank crews for a better armament in order to support the infantry. Early Churchill tanks were armed with cannons that had relatively lackluster high-explosive capabilities like the 2-pounder and 6-pounder guns. An enterprising REME (Royal Electric and Mechanical Engineers) Captain, Percy Morrell, recognized that there were many M4 Shermans slated to be scrapped with still functioning 75 mm armament. In a bid to upgrade the Churchill tanks for combat, he suggested and proved the feasibility of taking the M34 gun mantlet and 75 mm M3 cannon off the M4 Sherman tanks and installing them onto the turret face of the Churchill tanks. The modified Churchills, mostly Mark IVs, were given top priority with 200 modified with the M4 Sherman mantlet prior to June 1944. The modified tank was designated "NA75" (for North Africa 75 mm) and was sent to the Italian theater to fight, most notably during the assaults against the Gothic Line.

Introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' can be seen as a sidegrade grade of the [[Churchill III]], but with a 75 mm gun and a different turret design. This leads to somewhat lower penetration values compared to what the 6-pounder on the Mk III can provide, but the post-penetration damage on the NA75 is much stronger than what the 6-pounder can deliver. Another minor change to the NA75's benefit is stronger turret front armour due to the usage of the M4 Sherman mantlet in the turret front. However, with the same weight and engine as the Mk III, the Churchill NA75's manoeuverability on the battlefield will be very similar, if not exactly identical.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Churchill NA75 has the ability to angle the tank to improve overall frontal armour and thus survivability.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Cupola doors)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Hull machine gun area)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The cheek area of the turret is significantly reduced and well sloped sideways (previously a major weak spot of Churchill III)
* The 75 mm gun offers a significant improvement in firepower
* The M61 APHE shot makes engaging and destroying enemies much easier than with solid shots
* A great gun depression of -12 degrees makes fighting in mountainous terrain easy
* Excellent armour for its BR range; can withstand multiple enemy shots (except the German long 75 mm guns)
* Has smoke grenades to lay a smoke screen

'''Cons:'''

* Vehicle difficult to manoeuvre in tight and narrow streets, and with a terrible and slow reverse speed (-3 km/h)
* Slow top speed and poor mobility are inherent weaknesses, requiring extra caution in close quarters engagement.
* No primitive gun stabiliser for the 75 mm gun, sudden stopping of the tank causes the gun to wobble
