== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''', also known as the '''{{Specs|name}}''', was a heavily armoured wheeled combat vehicle developed in the early 1980s by Henschel Wehrtechnik, competing for a South African Army competition that called for a new wheeled AFV. The TH800 was the heaviest of the TH series prototypes, weighing a considerable 41 tons, and was intended to be used as a multi-purpose platform that could carry an anti-tank gun, AA cannons, SAMs, or even a 155 mm howitzer. The Class 3 prototype would ultimately lose to the lighter Rooikat, and would not be accepted into South African service. The massive Class 3 (P) was later exhibited at the Bloemfontein War Museum.

The Class 3 (P) was introduced during [[Update "Hot Tracks"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6981-special-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2020 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R.]] event. The most notable aspect of the Class 3 (P) is its outstanding size, as well as the similarly exceptional armour (and therefore weight) for a wheeled vehicle. These two traits give the Class 3 (P) good survivability against autocannons and even poorly aimed tank rounds, though the size of the vehicle precludes a stealthy playstyle. Despite its enormous size and weight, the Class 3 (P) is surprisingly mobile, with a top speed of 86 km/h in RB. The Class 3 (P)'s main armament is a fully stabilized 105 mm GT-3 cannon, providing it with sufficient firepower to engage most enemy vehicles it will face.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
[[File:Class 3 inner spall shields.png|thumb|350x350px|As seen here, the frontal plate has double spall shields divided by a 200 mm air spacing.]]
[[File:Class 3 inner turret spall shields.png|thumb|As seen here, the turret mantlet, front and sides all have double spall shields separated by an 80 mm air spacing]]
Due to the massive size of the Class 3, it is able to withstand high calibre ammunition due to the poor armour as it will not create enough spalling when penetrated. The crew spacing as well as the interior spacing makes it one of the hardest wheeled vehicles to destroy in the game with only kinetic energy (KE) penetrators (APDS, APFSDS, etc etc). Centre of mass shots from the front with KE shells will often take the driver and set the engine on fire, but due to the turret crew being elevated, they are most likely to survive, meaning the turret is operational ready to engage any enemy threats. Chemical energy (CE) penetrators are a tricky topic when it comes to the frontal armour. Depending on the ammunition used on certain impact angles, the Class 3 might be able to withstand the impact. CE rounds are most likely to penetrate and be partially or fully stopped thanks to the inner spall shields at a perpendicular angle but will knock out the driver and disable or damage engine as well as igniting the ammo rack. This changes when ATGMs take a play in engagements, they will often create much more spalling than tank-fired HEAT rounds as the calibre is higher (meaning a greater explosive mass) and will cause destruction by overpressure if hit from the sides or if the ATGM spall goes all the way from the front to the back while penetrating the sides. For this same reason it is recommended to only carry ~24-26 rounds in the vehicle as it will empty most of the hull ammo racks but still keep the ready racks full in the turret. The armour is not to be relied on unless there are specific enemies (T-54's for example) as most of them will always penetrate your hull. The Class 3 is immune to autocannon fire from the front and hull upper half sides and turret sides due to the spaced armour. This is an advantage compared to the rest of wheeled light armoured vehicles in which 20 mm and 30 mm autocannons often penetrate and knock out crew and inner components.

Having spall shields bring multiple benefits against both CE and KE.

''Against KE:''

The air gap between plates not only reduces and scatters the shrapnel in a flatter surface so that the penetrating remains are less but they also reduce the speed and penetration of small calibre fire (below 40 mm), meaning they will not penetrate the second plate (below 30 mm) or will reduce the amount of shrapnel generated (above 30 mm). They also prematurely detonate APCBC shells and reduce the shrapnel generated. Due to this, all APCBC and APHE fuses will be activated which can be lethal in calibres higher than 76 mm even with the spall shields depending on where the round hits at.

''Against CE:''

When a round is fired at the centre of mass frontally, the double plate armour will not only reduce the shrapnel but it is able to fully stop it, specially if said threat has a relative low explosive mass despite the armour penetration (PG-9 for example found on the [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1]]). When fired at the turret it may vary as it totally depends on the firing angle. A perpendicular hit to the turret will be lethal but an angled hit will often deviate the shrapnel which may damage or destroy modules but will keep the vehicle operational. Due to its huge height, the enemies that fire at turret will have a more angled hit, meaning that most of the shrapnel will be launched towards the roof and not to the crew compartment, this can take one or two crew members depending on the hit.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
Despite the tremendous size and mass, the Class 3 is almost as fast as the [[Radkampfwagen 90|Radkampfwagen]]. The 8 wheels give it an almost perfect cross-country capability with exception of mud, snow and deep sand. Acceleration wise, it takes time to make the Class 3 move if on a non urban environment or at an angle due to the mass. It has traction on the 8 wheels, meaning it is able to move even if only a pairs of wheels are touching the ground. As expected, due to the length, the turn radius is huge and it requires a big surface to be abe to make a 180° turn. Besides the length and height, the Class 3 is tremendously fast for a vehicle its size, specially if it is on urban environment. It is able to reach speeds of 80 km/h even on dirt. This not only makes the Class 3 a fearful tough to crack behemoth but also a flanking and "Hit N' Run" behemoth. Thanks to the stabilizer, the Class 3 is able to fire at enemy targets while on top speed, this requires practice but a handled commander will be able to achieve so.

{{main|GT-3 (105 mm)}}

The Class 3 has a GT-3 105 mm rifled bore main gun, it shares the same ballistics as the L7A3 the [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard]] family share with the exact same ammunition. Thus, there should be no hard enough threat to kill, specially if DM33 is being used with its potent 408 mm of penetration.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 4 & 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 15 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-38 into racks 5 then 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Class 3 is considered like a bigger Radkampfwagen. Due to its speed, it may be used in a flanking manner, being able to go around the enemy and surprise them where they do not expect. When flanking, it is recommended to use roads if possible, as the Class 3 is a wheeled vehicle, and rough terrain will slow it down. However, even off-road, the vehicle is still capable of speeds that are much higher than many other contemporary MBTs.

It may also be used in a playstyle of a fast MBT. While the hull of the Class 3 is weak and vulnerable to overpressure, the whole front of the vehicle has multiple well angled and very bouncy plates, both interior and exterior, which allows the turret and hull to sometimes take hits without damage, or even ricochet some shells. However, it is important to note that even though enemy shells have a chance of bouncing, it is best not to rely on this, and to use the vehicle's stabilizer and situational awareness to get the first shot off.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great top speed and good acceleration
* Lots of empty space, difficult to one shot without ammo racking
* Good gun, can deal with most enemies easily
* Good hull armour for a light tank, can frontally withstand most SPAA cannons as well as the guns of M3 Bradley and the BMP-2
* Turret is immune to every IFV and SPAA autocannon
* The length of the vehicle can cause APFSDS shrapnel created at the front of the tank to dissipate before it is able to reach the rear

'''Cons:'''

* Absolutely gigantic, size is on par with the Maus
* Because of its size it may have difficult traversing certain areas of maps, especially urban maps with lots of tight corners
* Mediocre gun depression of -8°

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The Henschel Wehrtechnik TH200, TH600 and TH800 were a series of armoured vehicles developed in Germany in the early '80s as test vehicles that could undertake a wide variety of combat roles. These vehicles have a hull of welded steel armour that provides guaranteed protection to low and high-calibre machine gun fire but lacks protection against anti-tank weaponry. A series of 3 versions were done: The TH200 4x4, the TH600 6x6 and TH800 8x8. Each one of the variants had their own combat roles.

'''TH200'''

The smallest version of the platform, it was meant to be used as a reconnaissance vehicle as well as a mobile support vehicle, armoured personal carrier and weapon carrier. It could utilize a 90 mm Cockerill gun and turret. The combat weight was around 9,250 kg making it capable of being transported by heavy air lifters and also give it amphibious capabilities.

'''TH400'''

It was a test bed for a mobile gun system with a 105 mm cannon in a three man turret. A Rh L/44 120 mm cannon could also be added. The combat weight of this vehicle was augmented to 24,500 kg, making it loose considerably the options for air lifters as well as losing completely the amphibious capabilities.

'''TH800'''

This version had a weight of 35,000 kg and could carry weapon systems with weight up to 13,000 kg, making it capable of carrying a heavier turret for both 105 mm and 120 mm cannons, anti-air systems for both 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons and Surface-to-Air Missiles and 155 mm howitzers.

=== [[wt:en/news/7001-development-class-3-en|Devblog]] ===
Class 3 was the third and heaviest wheeled combat vehicle prototype to compete for the South African Army. When developing a heavy version of a wheeled tank, the designers were not limited by limits of weight or dimensions, therefore, in terms of weight, firepower and level of security, the Class 3 is a true wheeled tank. The competition commission opted for a lighter prototype, which later became the Rooikat 76 tank destroyer. The Class 3 prototype was exhibited at the Bloemfontein War Museum with a different turret.
