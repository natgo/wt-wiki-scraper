== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. Armed with a 77 mm HV gun, essentially a 17-pounder with a lower muzzle velocity, it has one of the more powerful guns available for a medium tank at the rating.

The Comet is an excellent medium tank. It has great mobility and acceleration, able to reach 38 km/h very quickly and stay there in full throttle, but its reverse speed is pitiful like the Cromwell. Firepower is also a benefit of the vehicle, especially after the unlocking of the APDS shot, giving it the penetration needed to deal with any threat you might encounter. The drawback of the design is the sub-par armour that can be pretty easily penetrated at BR 5.3. One should take advantage of the Comet's low profile and mobility to hide and manoeuvre from the enemy to catch them at an advantageous angle. The Comet also has a benefit the previous tanks in its branch, the Sherman Firefly, didn't have in the great gun depression. This allows the Comet to more easily fire over hills in an hull-down position to destroy the enemy with a terrain benefit for protection.

This Comet is an example operated by the Finnish Defence Forces, imported in 1958 and used as training vehicles for the [[Charioteer Mk VII (Sweden)|Charioteers]] that they were bought alongside. It is identical in performance to the British [[Comet I]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret front, Gun mantlet)

'''Notes:'''

*Suspension wheels and the tracks are 20 mm thick.
*There are tracks attached on the turret that provide an extra 20 mm armour where they are attached.
*Steel boxes on the left and right side of the hull by the turret gives 4 mm extra armour at their location.
*The bustle rack on the back of the turret gives an armour rating of 5 mm.

Aim for the hull. You will almost certainly destroy the tank when a Comet player is reversing and panicking at the same time.

The turret is an unreliable area to target. Its armour is thicker and bouncy. A good Comet player will be in a hull down position, but you can easily take it out if you aim for the cupola or if your gun can take it, the turret cheeks.

The coaxial BESA has a rather low fire rate, and due to its coaxial mounting is generally only useful for striking unarmoured ground targets or highlighting enemies.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

Fighting a tank of the same weight classification is relatively easy, but can be difficult against the more armoured [[Panther A]], [[IS-1|IS series]] and angled [[Tiger H1|Tiger]] tanks. Until the APDS shot has been unlocked, more decisive shots will have to be made to take care of these tanks, the Mk.6 and Mk.8 shot are the preferred ammunition to use. The Panthers should be targeted on the gun mantlet in the front and should be aimed at the gunner to immobilize their firepower and cause crew damage. The T-34-85 is a bit of a hit-or-miss due to the more heavy sloping nature of the armour and the turret. Penetrating through the front hull armour when it is facing directly at you is the best course of action against the T-34-85. Heavy tanks get even more tricky, but easier once the APDS round is unlocked for use. A [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]] is admittedly an easy tank to deal with due to the vertical slope of the armour unless angled. Flanking should be used in this case. Problems arise with the [[IS-1]] and [[IS-2]] tanks that may show up, due to their heavy armour and the IS-2's tendency to absolutely wreck vehicles with its 122 mm gun. Distance is not your friend against this tank, the closer the better for your gun to penetrate the weak spots on its frontal armour. A tough situation, but a survivable one.

For every Comet player that does not have the APDS shells, do not engage in long distance gun fights. You are almost certainly going to lose. So use it first as its intention is, a cruiser tank. Capture the point and retreat. If you find yourself in a sticky situation, get as close to the enemy as possible and fire at its side. Conduct the battle in this manner until the APDS is unlocked

The best tactic is flanking and "shoot and scoot". Your armour won't stand against most tanks you'll meet so don't pick a sniping position and keep firing - sooner or later you will be pinned down. You need to locate a good spot for attack, fire a few shots (the Comet has great fire rate: use it) and relocate. Don't mind the damage you made: keep moving! Angling your front armour at a severe angle when peeking a corner an enemy is behind to bait a shot can also work in a pinch.

Also, another "never" to do with this tank, never go in reverse. You are almost certainly going to get yourself destroyed in the process as you have an awful reverse speed. If you want to reverse, turn the whole tank around instead using neutral steer or just charge at the enemy, circle him or her once and disappear the other way. You must do this as quickly as you appeared. You can use smoke grenades, but still, don't reverse, charge at the enemy. To not to get in the situation in the first place, choose where you are going to go carefully. You must study the situation quickly and cautiously to not to get yourself blown up in the process. The key is to run, run and run.

Overall, you must dedicate quite a bit of time to master the tank in all. Even when you have the APDS shells.

====Arcade battles====
In arcade domination mode where the capture points are arranged perpendicular to the other capture points (ex. Poland, Ash River, Berlin, Korea, Karelia, Kuban, etc.), go for the flanks (A or C). If the capture points are diagonal (ex. Stalingrad), go for the closest point. And if the capture points are in line with the spawns (ex. Ardennes, Eastern Europe, etc.) go for the middle point as fast as you can. If you feel that you cant make it, help cap the point closest to spawn. You can also decide if you want to defend the point after capturing it. It is suggested to defend the capture point that has a lot of cover and an easy escape if overwhelmed (Suggested points to defend: A or C in Poland, C in Stalingrad, C in Ardennes).

====Realistic/Simulator battles====
In realistic and simulator, the Comet can become sluggish and isn't as fast as in arcade. A suggestion would be to capture the closest point, cap it, and then go into hiding. When you go into hiding, take every well placed shot you can and immediately run away from an encounter. You will mainly be facing Tiger IIs, Tiger Is, and Panthers, T-34-85s, rarely Chi-Tos and Chi-Ris. If you encounter them on a one v. one, always be on the move. Move around the other tank and try to hit it from the side (Panthers, Tiger Is, Chi-Tos, and Chi-Ris). If you encounter a Tiger II, aim for its turret cheek with a APDS shell and take shoot it through the side. T-34-85 would be easier. You can quite easily penetrate the frontal armour of the T-34-85. It is just a matter of reaction time.

=== Specific enemies worth noting ===
Many heavy tanks will be an issue to deal with using stock AP shells, but with the APDS unlocked, it becomes a lot easier. As it has been mention before, when engaging a Tiger II, slap an APDS shell on the right turret cheek to knock out the gunner and finish it off from the side. The hardest tanks to counter are the following:

* [[Tiger I (Family)|Tiger I]]
* [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther]]
* [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]]
* [[T-34-85]]
* [[IS-1]]/[[IS-2]]

Although your gun can counter anything within the Comet's BR range, you should constantly be aware that one hit from pretty much any gun to the front of the hull will knock out the Comet. In particular, the Soviet 85 mm and 122 mm, and the German 75 and 88 mm guns should be taken very seriously. They have plenty of explosive filler. The Comet's turret has the chance to bounce even the mighty 88 mm gun found on the Tiger I, but only a chance. Your hull won't even protect you from the majority of rank 2 guns, so rank 3 and 4 guns will slice through the Comet's armour like butter. Because of this, almost any enemy is dangerous. Even SPAA can be a frontal threat to you. In particular, the [[Wirbelwind]] or the [[Ostwind]] can cause serious damage at close to medium range. Be particularly cautious late in a match when SPAA are more common.

Also be very aware of lightly armoured tank destroyers - these vehicles will be difficult to take out with the low spalling from your APDS shells, as well as your weak coaxial machine gun. If you find you are having problems dealing with these vehicles, consider bringing 2-3 rounds of HE in addition to the APDS.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent manoeuvrability and forward speed (~45 km/h on average), can even keep up with light tanks like [[M64]], [[M41A1|M41]]
* Accurate cannon with high penetration (up to 220 mm), can frontally penetrate heavily armoured tanks like [[Tiger II (H)]]
* Great 102 mm turret armour, enough to counter vehicles with weak guns (eg. [[M4A3E2]], [[Ostwind]])
* Impressive -12° gun depression is fit for mountain terrain combat
* Maximum 6x gunsight zoom, coupled with APDS makes long range sniping enjoyable
* Good climbing ability, can get to sniping positions that other tanks cannot
* Has access to neutral steering which allows quick repositioning of the tank

'''Cons:'''

* Low penetration against sloped armour (eg. UFP of [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther]], [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]]) without APDS
* Mediocre post-penetration damage, struggles against spacious targets like [[Jagdtiger]], [[Ho-Ro]], [[Nashorn]]
* Overall poor survivability: cramped crew and thin & flat armour, often taken out with 1 shot
* Awful -3 km/h reverse speed, must think twice before advancing
* Slow reload for the gun calibre due to cramped turret, every shot must count
