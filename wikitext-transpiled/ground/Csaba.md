== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''39.M Csaba (t͡ʃɒbɒ)''' was a Hungarian armoured car designed by Nicholas Straussler. During World War II, it was manufactured for the Royal Hungarian Army and saw extensive use on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. The Csaba is based on Straussler's Alvis AC2 armoured car design and is named after Attila the Hun's youngest son. Following successful trials in 1939, the Hungarian Army ordered 61 vehicles, followed by an additional order for 40 vehicles in 1940. Twenty of them were used as combat vehicles, with the others serving as armoured command and reconnaissance vehicles. The 39.M Csaba was armed with a 20 mm Solothurn QF.36M anti-tank autocannon and a coaxial 8 mm Gebauer machine gun. The vehicle also had a removable anti-aircraft 8 mm Solothurn light machine gun that was fired from the rear hatch. The crew could dismount and carry this LMG while conducting reconnaissance on foot. It also had two driving positions, one in the front and one in the back.

Introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], the 39.M Csaba is the starter vehicle for the Hungarian ground forces line of the Italian tech tree. Its high mobility helps players easily explore the map, capture points, and quickly flee from danger. The 20 mm [[Solothurn QF.36M (20 mm)|Solothurn QF.36M]] anti-tank autocannon has a quick reload but no fully automatic firing mode. As an armoured car developed for reconnaissance, it has a low profile and may readily set up an ambush for enemies early in battles. Unfortunately, players of the 39.M Csaba will struggle to defeat well-armoured enemy tanks due to the lacklustre penetration, as well as poor post-penetration damage. Furthermore, given the poor armour and cramped interior, any penetrating rounds, even from heavy machine guns, are often fatal.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Reverse gearbox allows it to retreat from danger or reposition quickly
* Fast 1 second reload speed lets it fire rapid follow-up shots
* Relatively high top speed, especially on paved roads
* Good mobility, even off-road
* Small profile makes it hard to spot and shoot at
* Geometric hull can bounce machine gun bullets
* 4 crewmembers allows it to survive some shots, unlike many vehicles at this rank with only 2 crewmembers
* Good gun depression
* Plenty of ammo

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely low survivability due to thin armour and cramped interior
* 20 mm shell has limited explosive filler, making spacious tanks (e.g. [[LVT(A)(1)|LVT(A)]], [[Pz.IV C|Pz.IV]]) hard to destroy
* Cannon has poor penetration (34 mm at most) especially as range increases, restricting its capacity
* Low weight, easily stopped by obstacles like small trees and fences
