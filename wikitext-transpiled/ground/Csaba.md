== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''39.M. Csaba (t͡ʃɒbɒ)''' was a Hungarian armoured car designed by Nicholas Straussler. During World War II, it was manufactured for the Royal Hungarian Army and saw extensive use on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. The armoured car is based on the Alvis AC2 armoured car and is named after Attila the Hun's son. Following successful trials in 1939, the Hungarian Army ordered 61 vehicles, followed by an additional order for 40 vehicles in 1940. Twenty of them were used as combat vehicles, with the others serving as armoured command and reconnaissance vehicles. The 39.M Csaba was armed with a 20 mm Solothurn QF.36M anti-tank autocannon and a coaxial 8 mm Gebauer 1934/37M light machine gun installed in an armoured turret. The coaxial 8 mm Gebauer machine gun carried 3000 rounds in 100-round ammunition belts, while the 20 mm Solothurn QF.36M anti-tank autocannon carried 200 shells in 5 shell capacity magazines, totalling 40 magazines. The vehicle also had a removable anti-aircraft 8 mm Solothurn light machine gun that was fired from the rear hatch. The crew could dismount and carry this LMG while conducting foot reconnaissance. It also had two driving positions, one in the front and one in the back.

Introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], the 39.M. Csaba is a starter vehicle of the Italian Army's ground forces. Its high mobility helps players easily explore the map and quickly flee from danger. The 20 mm Solothurn QF.36M anti-tank autocannon has a quick reload but no fully automatic firing mode. As a tiny, armoured car developed for reconnaissance, it has a low profile and may readily set up an ambush for enemies early in conflicts. Unfortunately, players playing 39.M. Csaba will struggle to defeat opponent tanks due to the lacklustre penetration and poor post-penetration effects. Furthermore, given the poor armour and cramped interior, any penetrating rounds, even from heavy machine guns, are almost always fatal.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Reverse gearbox allows it to retreat from danger or reposition quickly
* Fast 1-sec reload speed lets it fire rapid follow-up shots
* Relatively high topspeed especially on paved roads
* Small profile makes it hard to get spotted and shot at
* Geometric hull might bounce some bullets with luck

*

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely low survivability due to thin armor and cramped interior
* 20 mm shell has limited explosive filler, making spacious tanks (e.g. [[LVT(A)(1)|LVT(A)]], [[Pz.IV C|Pz.IV]]) hard to destroy
* Cannon has poor penetration (34 mm at most) especially as range increases, restricting its capacity
* Low weight, easily stopped by obstacles like small trees and fences
