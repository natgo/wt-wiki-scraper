== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The DF105 is a French-German tank destroyer/support tank design from the mid-80s, sister to the SK-105 series of tanks. It uses the German Marder IFV hull, with a French FL-15 turret.

Introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]], the DF105 is very lightly armoured, only having 40 mm of armour at most, but decent mobility having a 720 hp engine for its 30t weight. However, its armament is where it shines. It is equipped with a CN-105-57 cannon, with its main ammo being HEAT with 400 mm of penetration. While the shells it fires might not be the best, however it makes up by having only a 5-second reload in a 12-round first stage ammo rack.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The DF105 has very thin armour. It can be penetrated in the sides by .50 cals quite easily. This does not mean it is not survivable. The tank is very spacious inside, making it quite survivable against the APFSDS which is the most common ammunition you will be shot at with. However, HE, HESH, and HEAT rounds are devastating against this vehicle. Its simple geometry and quite large size mean that it is relatively easy to knock out with explosive-type munitions.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (entire hull, turret sides, turret roof, turret back)
* Cast homogeneous armour (front turret, lower side turret, cupola)
* Rubber-fabric screens (side skirts)

'''Notes:'''

* Tracks, suspension wheels, and torsion bars are 20 mm thick.
* There is 5 mm internal RHA plating separating engine compartment from the crew compartment.
* Mudguards and storage boxes are 4 mm thick
* Belly armour is 11 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The mobility of the DF105 is respectable. It allows for quickly getting to capture points and flanking positions. Powered by a 720 hp MB-833 Ka-500 engine just like the [[TAM]], it can reach up to 70 km/h. It can also reach the same speed in reverse, which can be extremely useful for close-quarters fights, and for when a risky flank might be needed. It is overall very nimble, and its mobility will not let you down.

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,116|rbMinHp=637}}

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The DF105 is quite okay when stock. It comes stock with its best and only shell that can deal with armoured targets.

When spading this vehicle, Parts and FPE are always the most important things to have. "Artillery support", "Smoke grenade", and "Crew replenishment" are modifications that are generally important, so a balance between those "support" modifications along with your "main" modification is needed.

Depending on your playstyle, you might prefer to play this as a scout so "Airstrike", "Improved Optics", "Artillery Support" and "Crew Replenisment" is what you would want, along with "Engine", "Transmission", "Filters" and "Tracks" to increase its overall mobility, helping it reach advantageous positions first.

You can also use this tank as a Support tank, where mobility and firepower counts most. If you prefer to play like this, prioritising "Adjustment of Fire", "Horizontal Drive" and "Elevation mechanism" would be your top priority, followed closely by "Engine", "Transmission", "Filters" and "Tracks" and "Smoke grenade" for getting out of tricky situations

{{main|CN105-57 (105 mm)}}

The CN-105-57 that the DF105 sports is a pretty powerful cannon due to its very low reloading time. You sometimes have enough time to shoot the enemy a 2nd time before they get their guns on you in case you missed your first shot, or you did not disable their ability to shoot.

The only con of this gun is the fact that it only shoots HEAT. At this BR, it is a very good shell, being able to deal devastating damage to most vehicles you will face, and has enough punching power to penetrate virtually any vehicle you face from the front. However, the shell is quite slow at 800 m/s, giving it quite some drop compared to more conventional ammo.

The turret rotation is decent, but its vertical guidance is somewhat lacking. Due to its oscillating turret design, the turret has a tendency when stopping to go up and down more times and more aggressively than a conventional design, which can be a significant disadvantage compared to stabilized platforms.

You also get access to a smoke shell and an HE shell. Both of which have their own uses, but should only be brought in small numbers, as they are nowhere nearly as effective as the main HEAT round.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 3* and 4* (autoloader magazines) are first stage ammo racks. They total 12 shells.
** These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.
** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
** Once the autoloader magazines have been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 2 into rack 4 then 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
** The depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 1 - 2.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Due to its high mobility, high penetration HEAT round, and autoloader, the tank offers great potential for flanking around the frontline and picking off enemy vehicles from a variety of angles. The HEAT round allows the player to destroy nearly every vehicle they might encounter (except for tanks featuring composite armour) at every range. However, the high drop, the low velocity of the ammo, and the lack of a rangefinder make hitting the first shot at longer ranges difficult. Thus, it is best used at around 800 m or in a squad with vehicles featuring rangefinders. The greatest danger to the tank, when in a flanking role, would be other light tanks (especially those outfitted with autocannons), which remain operational after the first shot. Aircraft also pose a high risk to the tank, since the roof armour is only 10 mm thick.

The tank is also very useful at suppressing enemies, since the autoloader and relatively high turret traverse enable the tank to fire at multiple targets in a short time. It can also be used to engage medium/heavy tanks in close proximity and on urban maps. However, one should try to destroy the enemies' cannon first, since return fire can be expected prior to the second shot. Using the tank for such tactics comes at a relative risk, since shots from cannons can often disable the tank. Another risk of this strategy is the swift destruction one may face when encountering light tanks with autocannons or anti-air vehicles.

Regardless of strategy, the tank works best when using cover. While it has a small turret, leaving it exposed is not favourable, since it not only houses two of the three crew members, but also up to 12 shots of ammunition. Baiting enemy tanks to push you by firing a shot is also a good idea. However, whilst the autoloader is fast, one has to remember that is not instantaneous, and that taking hits is a bad idea in the DF105.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good mobility
* Powerful HEAT shell
* Autoloader grants a short and steady reload time
* Small turret profile. It is possible to peek over hills at long range with lower chance of getting hit
* Very spacious interior leading to non-explosive shells dealing little to no damage unless they hit critical components.

'''Cons:'''

* Little to no armour. Explosive-type ammunition and .50 cals will have an easy time to go through you.
* Lacks a gun stabilizer leads to a bouncy gun sight when moving and slowing to a stop
* Quite big in size, which can be a disadvantage in close-quarters fights

== History ==

The '''Combat Tank DF 105''' was built by Thyssen-Henschel as a Franco-German cooperation in the arms sector initially built for the German Bundeswehr, but shifted towards export instead. It used the hull of the [[Marder IFV (Family)|Marder I]], with a oscillating turret housing the [[CN105-57 (105 mm)]] which was meant for the [[AMX-13 (Family)|AMX-13 series]]. While it was built as a support light tank, it could still carry up to 5 infantry in the back of the tank thanks to the crew compartment the Marder's hull provides, this space could otherwise be used to store up to 50 rounds of 105 mm ammunition.
