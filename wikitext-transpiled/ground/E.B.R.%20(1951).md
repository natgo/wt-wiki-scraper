== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The E.B.R 1951's armor is primarily designed to protect against small-caliber machine gun fire and shell fragments. Its hull and turret are made of welded steel plates, providing reasonable protection against low-caliber machine guns and light artillery fire. However, it should be noted that the E.B.R 1951 is not intended to engage in direct combat with heavy tanks or powerful anti-tank weaponry.

While the armor is not very thick, the tank compensates for its vulnerability by relying on its excellent speed and agility to avoid enemy fire. Its speed and maneuverability make it a difficult target for slower tanks and artillery, allowing the E.B.R 1951 to employ hit-and-run tactics effectively.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The E.B.R (1951) is a fast light tank perfect for flanking and capturing points. In open maps, try to be the first in flanking points. Its low muzzle velocity and poor accuracy make its canon unreliable above 600 m. If attacked frontally, try to outspeed or outmanoeuvre your enemy. If immobilised, try to shoot the enemy's canon or weak points. In rural and urban combat, your only strategy will be to flank otherwise you'll not be able to penetrate medium and heavy tanks at this BR. Its weak armour can't resist .50 cal HMGs from the sides so be careful against M18s and Shermans. When threatened by multiple enemies, use the smoke to cover your retreat and do not engage them even if it's to destroy a track or taking an easy shot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely fast on road, both forward and backwards like the [[Sd.Kfz.234 (Family)|Sd.Kfz.234]]
* Fast turret traverse of ~25°/s allows it to engage agile targets like [[M18 Hellcat (Family)|M18]] easily
* 75 mm M61 shell has great penetration and explosive filler. Can knock out common tanks like [[Pz.IV H]], [[M4A3 (76) W|M4A3]], [[T-34-57]], etc. with a single shot
* Has a narrow and low silhouette, easy to hide behind vegetation and cover
* High reverse speed and access to smoke grenade launchers grant it excellent tactical agility, meaning that the EBR can get out of dangerous situations quickly
* Capable of quick retreat and movement even with the loss of a wheel
* Frontal armour is entirely capable of shrugging off .50 cals

'''Cons:'''

* Relies on roads heavily as mobility on loose surfaces is quite poor
* Thin side armour can be penetrated by anything more powerful than .30 cals: heavy MGs and autocannons (e.g. [[M16 MGMC]], [[Wirbelwind]]) are considerably dangerous
* Steering radius is quite large, navigation in confined environment can be awkward
* M61 shell cannot reliably penetrate tanks like [[StuG III G]], [[T14]], [[KV-1E]]
* Wheels are large and spread out, can get damaged easily
