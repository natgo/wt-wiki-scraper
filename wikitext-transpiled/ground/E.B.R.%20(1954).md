== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Panhard Engin Blindé de Reconnaissance (E.B.R.) Modèle 1954''' is the second variant of the [[E.B.R. (Family)|Panhard E.B.R. armoured car family]]. The improved Panhard E.B.R. Modèle 1954 was designed to enhance the firepower of the reconnaissance vehicle. Between 1954 and 1956, about 279 units were produced, equipped with the FL10A2C oscillating turret. The Panhard E.B.R. Modèle 1954's suspension was upgraded to withstand the higher weight of the vehicle. The long-barrelled 75 mm SA 50 L/57 tank gun was fed by an autoloader consisting of two six-round ammunition drums situated in the turret bustle. The vehicle could carry a total of 36 rounds. The gunner used an APX L 862 monocular gun sight with a magnification of 7.5.

Introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6981-special-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2020 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R. event]], the Panhard E.B.R. Modèle 1954 is equipped with good optics and a high velocity 75 mm SA 50 L/57 tank gun. It can be utilized as a long-range sniper and scout vehicle, or it can be deployed as an aggressive flanking vehicle due to its superior mobility and fast reload rate. The Panhard E.B.R. Modèle 1954 excels on flanking manoeuvres, where it can remove several opponents in a short period of time thanks to its autoloader and high-velocity ammunition. Due to the lack of explosive filler for the shell, targeting crucial modules is critical, such as the tank gun barrel, gun breech, or ammunition rack of the target. The autoloader and quick turret rotation make switching between enemy targets easy in the heat of battle, while the smoke grenades allow for a rapid retreat if the situation becomes too dangerous.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof, turret bustle)
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet, turret front)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=310|rbMinHp=177}}

The E.B.R. (1954) can reach 105 km/h on roads, 60 km/h on dirt tracks and 40 km/h in cross country. Soft terrain is a handicap: mud, snow and sand will considerably slow the armoured car. As a wheeled vehicle, it can't turn on the spot but the turn radius stays relatively small thanks to front and rear steering wheels. Much like the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2|Sd.Kfz 234/2 Puma]], the tank has a driver on both sides of the hull (albeit the driver in the back being classified as a loader ingame) and also has a reverse gearbox, meaning that you can reverse as if you were facing backwards at full speed which helps relocating efforts.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The EBR can be used as a long range sniper and as a scout vehicle thanks to its good optics and fast shell speed, or it can be used as an aggressive flanking vehicle using its superior mobility and reload rate.

The EBR best performs on the sidelines of the enemy team, using its autoloader and high velocity gun to eliminate any opposition. The lack of explosive filler for the shell makes aiming at crew positions and critical modules important, prioritizing the gun barrel, breech, or ammo rack of the target. Thanks to the autoloader and fast turret rotation, it is easy to switch between targets in the heat of combat, and the smoke grenades allow for a quick escape if the situation gets too difficult.

On snowy terrain, it is recommended to stay on roads as the wheels lose their grip on snow much more and result in slower acceleration and top speeds compared to on roads or concrete etc.

;<nowiki>Enemies worth keeping note of:</nowiki>

* [[Tiger I (Family)|Tiger I]] and [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther I]]: Although sitting at a lower BR, these targets are common to encounter on the battlefield. Flanking them and shooting their weakly armoured sides is advised, but in case of a face to face encounter, shooting the right side (from the players point of view) of the Panther's mantlet or the right side of the Tiger's Hull will disable or destroy them. In case these shots are impossible or too risky, one can shoot the barrels, take a track out and relocate and target the side of said tanks. Other weakspots are mostly shared with other guns, such as the Panther's turret corners or the flat front armor of the Tiger 1s if unangled.

When encountering vehicles classified as heavy tanks or even some higher BR medium tanks, it can often be the case that your frontal engagement options can be quite limited. Vehicles such as the [[T26E1-1]], [[T26E5]], [[T34]], [[Tiger II (H)]], [[Jagdtiger|Jagdtiger]] and [[T-54/55 (Family)|T-54s]] can have armor far exceeding the SA50 gun's capabilities save for very small and hard to hit weakspots, and some even come equipped with stabilizers like the [[Centurion Mk.2]] and [[Centurion Mk 3|Centurion Mk.3]] which can abruptly end your flanking maneuvers. When facing vehicles such as these that need either extreme precision or good awareness on when to peek, it may be more beneficial to go for the barrel of said vehicles to get a better flanking approach on them. Alternatively, you may also choose to simply scout and/or barrel them before relocating to a better position altogether. You shouldn't take every fight in the E.B.R. (1954) and there is no shame in retreating to a better location if you feel like you can't get a good shot in.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast and very mobile chassis
* The main gun reloads in 5 seconds regardless of remaining crew count and the autoloader has a capacity of 12 rounds, giving the vehicle good overall sustain for a drum autoloading vehicle.
* The shells have a very high muzzle velocity and, despite the lack of explosive filler, deals a lot of damage.
* Both the front and back wheels steer, resulting in a fairly small turning radius.
* The hull armour, in the front (and back), is enough to stop .50 cal MG fire, as well as 14.5 mm AP-I(c) from 200 meters or more; the turret front may be even able to stop some autocannon fire.
* As this vehicle is an armoured car, scouting is available.
* APBC shell with a very high penetration of 182 mm at 10 m, able to easily penetrate most vehicles that the vehicle can face.

'''Cons:'''

* The 7° gun depression is far from optimal for players that want to shoot from an hull down position.
* Relatively poor angled performance of the ammunition, and as such it is recommended to shoot at flat plates if possible.
* The massive radio antennas will make you visible even when the rest of the vehicle is hidden behind a hill or small building.
* Very easy to spot and recognize from the side due to its size and shape; in addition, the side armour won't really stop anything more than small calibre machine gun fire.
* The roof of the turret is thin, making it vulnerable to airborne attacks.
* Sluggish when moving in snow or mud.
* High risk of ammunition explosion if the turret is penetrated, due to the large first-stage ammo rack behind the cannon.

Before the outbreak of World War II, Panhard created a prototype of an 8x8 army wheeled all-terrain vehicle, with the first and last swivel wheel pairs having rubber tires, the middle pairs were metal and not swivel. The army placed an order for the production of 600 of these vehicles, but the outbreak of the war and the occupation of France did not allow the vehicle to be put into production. They returned to an interesting project after the war - the wheelbase received an oscillating turret with a 75 mm gun, which turned the all-terrain vehicle into a light wheeled tank. Later, the base of this vehicle became the basis for several curious army vehicles. It is interesting that it was the Panhard all-terrain vehicle that served as a carriage for the farewell ceremony for the President of the Fifth Republic, General Charles de Gaulle.
