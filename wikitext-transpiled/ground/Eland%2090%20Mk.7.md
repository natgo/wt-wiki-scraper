== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

The Eland 90 Mk.7 is a light reconnaissance armoured car, built in 1962 by South Africa as a domestic variant of the French armoured car, the [[AML-90|Panhard AML-90]].

While the diminutive size and unpretentious look can be deceiving, this armoured car is sure to be one of the most agreeable light vehicles in the British ground forces. This combination of a remarkably mobile and small chassis plus satisfactory firepower is otherwise rarely found in British light vehicles; similarly to the reliable [[Crusader III]] and equal to the uncommon [[AEC Mk II|AEC Mk.II]].

Meanwhile, Eland's weak armour is a problem for survival thus players will have to rely on flanking, scouting or ambushing tactics when engaging heavier armour.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour of the Eland 90 Mk.7 is little to nonexistent. The fact it only has 10 mm of armour gives it extremely low survivability, even 7.62 mm MG can penetrate the armour on some areas. The crew is compacted inside a really small box, making 90% of the rounds fired at it (both main gun and machine guns) one shot potential. While the thin armour might not trigger APHE fuses, it will surely trigger HE, HEAT. Regardless, not triggering an APHE fuse leaves any incoming shell to act as a solid shot, severely damaging the crew.

'''Armour type:'''

*Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
*Structural steel (mudguards, storage boxes)
*Wheel (tires)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=139|rbMinHp=80}}

The Eland 90 Mk.7, similar to the AML-90, are Formula 1 cars compared to the tanks seen at the battle rating. The low profile, weight, and the fact they are wheeled makes this vehicle extremely fast. However, this '''only''' applies to asphalt or solid ground maps. The mobility is significantly reduced in mud, water, sand and snow, reducing the speed from nearly 100 km/h down to 20 km/h.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|GT-2 (90 mm)}}

The Eland 90 uses the powerful 90 mm GT-2 low pressure cannon. The Eland 90 comes with a stock OCC 60-62 HEATFS ammunition, capable of penetrating most tanks at its BR at any distance. It should be noted that it only carries 29 rounds at max, 9 more rounds than the AML-90 but still a low count, and coupled with the poor survivability, commanders should always shoot to destroy in the least shots necessary, know center of mass, ammunition racks, etc to successfully engage a target.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 5 and 6 are first stage ammo racks. They total 10 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 5 - 6 - 1 - 2 etc. until 4.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 4 into racks 6 then 5. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Eland should be primarily used as a scout flanking vehicle due to its high speed, low profile, scouting capabilities and firepower (tremendous for such a small vehicle). The Eland has primarily 3 uses:

'''Scouting:'''

When on large maps, the scouting ability should be used at its full potential. The low profile and high speed make it able to crawl to cover fast and without creating much suspicion, while marking targets for friendlies to engage.

'''Flanking:'''

Due to the high speed and really powerful gun, the Eland can be used to hit any enemy from the back. This tactic should be a "Hit n' Run", you should disable or destroy targets and leave before they can engage you. This is nothing hard for the Eland as long as the escape routes and alternative routes are clear and within easy access.

'''Sniping:'''

Despite the optics not having a huge zoom, it is enough to be able to detect, target, and engage enemy vehicles at all ranges thanks to the HEAT-FS round. Be aware of your ammo as it can only carry 29 shells, so make all shots count. It also creates a relatively small smoke trail when firing compared to other cannons at the battle rating (105 mm, other 90 mm, 122 mm) thanks to the muzzle brake. Bushes can also be used to make this vehicle nearly invisible, due to its already low profile. A bunch of branches can cover almost 70% of the front, making it a moving and deadly bush. It also creates a small engine sound that will be, most of the time, masked up by other tanks, giving you a stealth capability which can be exploited in urban combat.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good mobility and acceleration with a dynamic reverse speed, even when stock
* Small size; perfect for ambushes
* 90 mm HEATFS provides great penetration; even more than the APDS found on the similarly ranked [[FV4202]]
* Smoke shells and smoke grenades to enhanced protection and support role
* More lenient playstyle than the previous Ratel IFVs, thanks to reduced size while conserving firepower and mobility
* Small size significantly reduces probability of death via [[Artillery Support|artillery]] (unlike on the [[Ratel 90]] and [[Ratel 20|20]])
* It is essentially a slightly better [[AML-90]] - it has hydraulic brakes which allow for much needed reduction to braking distance

'''Cons:'''

* As a light wheeled vehicle, it has an unstable handling at high speed
* Very thin armour; easily destroyed by heavy machine guns and aircraft
* No stabilizer; the vehicle cannot effectively use the speed and firepower at the same time
* HEATFS damage is unreliable in some situations; the sensitivity of the fuse is the main concern
* Only 3 crew members and ammo tightly storage within, likely to be disabled in a single hit
* Wide turning radius (cannot turn on the spot due to lack of tracks)
* Awful handling off-road, especially on snow and desert maps like [[Tunisia]] or [[Finland]]
* Prior to researching "Brake System" modification it suffers insufficient braking power, amplified by the high power-to-weight ratio
