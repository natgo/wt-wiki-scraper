== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29_Sd.Kfz._Index|Sd.Kfz. Index:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 184''') is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Wind of Change"]] as reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VII, "Armoured Elephant"]].

=== Pros and cons ===

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The history of the Elefant begins with the program to develop the Tiger 1, both Porsche and Henschel would compete and submit designs for trials, where eventually one would be chosen for production. Porsche's design was the infamous [[VK 45.01 (P)]], a design riddled with mechanical issues apparent even during the trials, while Henschel's design was the VK 45.01 (H) which would ultimately end up being chosen and would enter production as the Tiger H1.

Ferdinand Porsche, the founder of the company Porsche was far too confident in his VK design, so much so that even before the trials for the Tiger had begun he had created 90 VK hulls. It was decided that these would not go to waste, and a majority were turned into the casemate assault gun known as the Ferdinand, which would mount the long 88. cm gun eventually seen in vehicles such as the Tiger II (H), Nashorn or Jagdpanther; while 1 of the VK hulls would become the Panzerbefehlswagen VI (P).

The Ferdinand tank destroyer would first see service during Operation Citadel, specifically during the battle of Kursk to mixed results. The aforementioned mechanical problems would plague it during the battle; however when used in its intended role, the Ferdinand would be quite successful.

Following the battle, the remaining Ferdinands would be sent back to Germany for repairs and modifications. Here is where the Elefant was born. Additional frontal armor, a hull mounted machine gun for self-defense purposes and a commander's cupola taken from a StuG III G would be the new additions to the vehicle, before it was sent to Italy, with disastrous results.

Little is known about the Elefant's service following this, however at least two individuals survived to take part in the Battle of Berlin, but their ultimate fate remains unknown.

One Elefant remains, formerly part of an exhibit in the Bovington Tank Museum it is now in storage in Fort Lee VA.
