<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features.

Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Light support tank FCM.36) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]]. Though affectionately nicknamed the "Cone" due to the turret's shape. The FCM.36 was removed as a researchable vehicle from the main tech tree during [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]] after the ammo update that rendered its armament impotent, though it is still unlockable after reaching rank II French ground vehicles.

Generally speaking, what used to be the main reason you'd play the FCM.36 is so it can unlock better vehicles like the [[AMR.35 ZT3]] to have better firepower at the rank. Bearing the awful [[SA18 L/21 (37 mm)|37 mm SA18 L/21]] cannon as the main armament with 40 mm of armour all around and bad mobility, this tank resembles the [[H.35]] in many ways. However, the FCM.36 does have well-sloped armour for the rank to be a tad useful during long range engagements, but the underperforming gun makes the FCM.36 act more like a shield rather than a spear.

Compared to the [[H.35]], the {{PAGENAME}} features a design with "better" armour and a more powerful engine, bringing the power ratio to a more manageable 12.4 HP/ton. With wider tracks than the H.35, this tank feels faster than other BR 1.0 French tanks. It turns quite smoothly and reaches its top speed fairly easily on road. 40 mm all around is enough to survive incoming rounds at long distances (~ 500+ m) but its bad angling makes it unreliable at close range, whereas your gun enters its actual combat ranges. Keeping the awful SA18 L/21 canon as the main armament, this gun is what makes an otherwise good tank so bad as it is. As the Devblog claims: "Wait Until You See The Whites of Their Eyes!", you will have to get up close and personal with this tank in order to penetrate another tank. With -17° of gun depression, this is actually a depressing gun.

'''Notes''':

* The visual discrepancy concerns the number of shells per rack:
** Rack 1 is modeled as 60 shells but contains 65 shells.
** Rack 2 is modeled as 42 shells but contains only 37 shells. The shells in excess remain visible, so the rack 2 is never empty.
* As they are modeled by sets of 5, shells disappear from the rack only after you fire all shells in the set.

The small calibre of the MAC 31 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Bullet magnet''':

Sit down in an open field, angle yourself and stay at a good distance (500+ m) from any threat. Watch enemy shells ricochet of your armour, spot enemies for the team. Whenever a potent gun comes your way, '''flee''' and hope not to get shot at. Blind such big guns with your good MAC 31 coaxial machine gun and attempt a few shots on the move (big guns generally means poor armour at this BR).

If you intend to play in RB or SB, use brush or other objects to obscure your vehicle's outline, so that the enemy doesn't entirely know what you are, and therefore have a chance of not taking shots at your weak points such as your gun mantle or driver port.

One notable recent change is that due to the new volumetric shells, it is nearly impossible to hit the FCM.36's vulnerable turret ring. In addition, it is much harder to actually damage anything from shooting through the weak spot on the mantlet; The commander's right side is protected by the large drum of the MAC 31, and hits to his left will now often hit the breech. This makes the FCM much more well protected. Shots that penetrate will usually be absorbed by various parts inside the turret.

'''"Brawler":'''

''Never'' engage an enemy upfront: assist your allies in flanking manœuvres and don't bother stealing a score since it's all you can get with such a poor cannon. Feel free to turn you back anytime and flee when allies are lacking, go find friends and act as a bullet magnet for them as they attempt to flank enemies.

'''Not the size that matters its the technique'''

In the right hands, this tank can be used correctly to a degree. Practice with the gun along with knowledge of enemy armour, it can pen most enemy vehicles but anything above rank II tanks is nearly impossible to pen.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent frontal armour with good sloping
* -17° of gun depression angle
* Turret is 40 mm thick all-around
* Shoulder stabiliser makes stop-and-shoot tactic easier

'''Cons:'''

* Very bad penetration power
* Very poor mobility:
** Weak engine
** Slow top speed
** Bad reverse speed : -3 km/h
* Cannot angle properly without exposing a flat surface
* Only 2 crew members, cramped and sitting in line

== History ==

In 1934, the FCM company received an order from the French army to design a modern tank for their light tank regiments. FCM was an experienced tank manufacturer, having proved themselves with work on previous projects (such as the Char 2C and Char B1), and quickly developed a new light tank design. Just over a year after the initial wooden mockup was presented and approved by the Army, the first prototype was tested in April 1935. During the one year testing period, multiple changes were made to make the vehicle more reliable, lighter, and better protected.

In July 1936, the FCM 36 was declared the best of three competing vehicles (which included the Hotchkiss H35 and Renault R35), although all three vehicles were still produced. But due to the Rhineland crisis in May 1936, the FCM company received orders for 100 of the FCM 36 tanks before it was even proclaimed the winner of the competition. Production of the FCM 36 did not begin until 1937, after tests of an improved version failed to produce the desired results. The first FCM 36 tanks left the factory floor in May 1938, and joined the ranks of the Army the following year. After the initial order of 100 vehicles was fulfilled, production was discontinued in favour of the Char B1, (also manufactured by FCM).

During the Invasion of France in 1940, the 100 FCM 36s in service with the French army saw limited success against the latest German armour—most notably the Panzer III. Although both vehicles offered similar overall performance, long tank battles against the Panzer III often resulted with neither vehicle able to achieve a fatal blow against the other. Unfortunately, the welds of the FCM 36's heavily angled and complex armour would eventually break from extensive and repeated battle damage, which left the Panzer III as the victor in the long run. During the German occupation, the FCM 36 was initially used by the German army as a training or reserve vehicle. In 1943/44, 37 captured FCM 36s were converted into tank destroyers or self-propelled artillery pieces.
