== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

In 1933, the French military sought for the creation of a new infantry tank to replace the Renault FT. The requirements called for a simple tank that was of 6 ton weights and used a cast turret design produced by the government APX workshop. The firm that won the requirement in 1934 was the Renault ZM design that would become the [[R.35_(SA38)|Renault R.35]], however the design by FCM proved promising enough due to its welded construction and better turret design that the French army also provided them a production model in 1936. However, production complications due to the relatively advanced welding construction and other production priorities at FCM for the [[B1_bis|Char B1 bis]] meant late deliveries and high unit cost that the design had its production halted in 1940. Two battalions in the French army would use the FCM.36, the 4e and 7e, and they would be committed in the Battle of France against the German invasion, most notably seeing use in challenging a German bridgehead over the Meuse river. Upon the capitulation of France, the Germans would utilize the FCM.36 in their military, with one notable use being the conversion of several hulls into the Marder I with a 75 mm PaK 40 cannon as the ''7.5cm PaK40(Sf) auf Geschützwagen FCM(f)''.

Introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]], the FCM.36 compares more so to the [[H.35]] tank with similarily poor firepower, but the FCM.36 has better protection with 40 mm sloped armour all-around. The FCM.36's well-sloped armour makes it a tad beneficial for long-range combat, but the underperforming gun makes the FCM.36 act more like a shield rather than a spear. The FCM.36 does have marginally better mobility than the H.35 with better handling and a more powerful engine, allowing it to turn smoothly and reach its top speed fairly easily (even if its top speed is still a relative crawl). However, the difficulty in finding a good position to make the most use of its gun and armour makes the FCM.36 a hard challenge to use against players to begin scratching their armour.

At its introduction, the FCM.36 left a favorable impression in the community due to its unique turret shape, earning the nickname "Cone". However, due to its disappointing firepower capabilities, the FCM.36 was removed as a researchable vehicle from the main tech tree during[[ Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]], though it is still unlockable after reaching rank II French ground vehicles.

'''Notes''':

* The visual discrepancy concerns the number of shells per rack:
** Rack 1 is modeled as 60 shells but contains 65 shells.
** Rack 2 is modeled as 42 shells but contains only 37 shells. The shells in excess remain visible, so the rack 2 is never empty.
* As they are modeled by sets of 5, shells disappear from the rack only after you fire all shells in the set.

The small calibre of the MAC 31 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Bullet magnet'''

Sit down in an open field, angle yourself and stay at a good distance (500+ m) from any threat. Watch enemy shells ricochet of your armour, spot enemies for the team. Whenever a potent gun comes your way, take cover and hope not to get shot at. Blind such big guns with your good MAC 31 coaxial machine gun and attempt a few shots on the move (big guns generally means poor armour at this BR).

If you intend to play in RB or SB, use bushes or other objects to obscure your vehicle's outline, so that the enemy doesn't entirely know what you are, and therefore have a chance of not taking shots at your weak points such as your gun mantlet or driver port.

One notable recent change is that due to the new volumetric shells, it is nearly impossible to hit the FCM.36's vulnerable turret ring. In addition, it is much harder to actually damage anything from shooting through the weak spot on the mantlet; The commander's right side is protected by the large drum of the MAC 31, and hits to his left will now often hit the breech. This makes the FCM much more well protected. Shots that penetrate will usually be absorbed by various parts inside the turret.

'''Brawler'''

Never engage an enemy upfront: assist your allies in flanking manoeuvres and don't bother stealing a score since it's all you can get with such a poor cannon. Feel free to fall back when allies are lacking, go find friends and act as a bullet magnet for them as they attempt to flank enemies.

In the right hands, this tank can be used correctly to a degree. Practice with the gun along with knowledge of enemy armour, it can pen most enemy vehicles but anything above rank II tanks is nearly impossible to pen.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent frontal armour with good sloping
* -17° of gun depression angle
* Turret is 40 mm thick all-around
* Shoulder stabiliser makes stop-and-shoot tactic easier

'''Cons:'''

* Very bad penetration power
* Very poor mobility: weak engine, slow top speed, and bad reverse speed
* Cannot angle properly without exposing a flat surface
* Only 2 crew members, cramped and sitting in line

In 1934, the FCM company received an order from the French army to design a modern tank for their light tank regiments. FCM was an experienced tank manufacturer, having proved themselves with work on previous projects (such as the Char 2C and Char B1), and quickly developed a new light tank design. Just over a year after the initial wooden mockup was presented and approved by the Army, the first prototype was tested in April 1935. During the one year testing period, multiple changes were made to make the vehicle more reliable, lighter, and better protected.

In July 1936, the FCM 36 was declared the best of three competing vehicles (which included the Hotchkiss H35 and Renault R35), although all three vehicles were still produced. But due to the Rhineland crisis in May 1936, the FCM company received orders for 100 of the FCM 36 tanks before it was even proclaimed the winner of the competition. Production of the FCM 36 did not begin until 1937, after tests of an improved version failed to produce the desired results. The first FCM 36 tanks left the factory floor in May 1938, and joined the ranks of the Army the following year. After the initial order of 100 vehicles was fulfilled, production was discontinued in favour of the Char B1, (also manufactured by FCM).

During the Invasion of France in 1940, the 100 FCM 36s in service with the French army saw limited success against the latest German armour—most notably the Panzer III. Although both vehicles offered similar overall performance, long tank battles against the Panzer III often resulted with neither vehicle able to achieve a fatal blow against the other. Unfortunately, the welds of the FCM 36's heavily angled and complex armour would eventually break from extensive and repeated battle damage, which left the Panzer III as the victor in the long run. During the German occupation, the FCM 36 was initially used by the German army as a training or reserve vehicle. In 1943/44, 37 captured FCM 36s were converted into tank destroyers or self-propelled artillery pieces.
