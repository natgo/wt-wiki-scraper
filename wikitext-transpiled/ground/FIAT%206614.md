== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (hull)
- Gun steel (gun barrel, MG)
- Wheel (tires)

'''Notes:'''

- All windows are 8 mm thick.
- The tires are 10 mm thick.
- The belly is 8 mm thick.

The {{PAGENAME}} has almost no armour, like other vehicles in the Italian tree, and with that very low survivability. Anything that hits a side shot will knock out at least one crew member, while a frontal or rear shot will incapacitate a minimum of 3 crew, enough to take the player back to the hangar.

The average effective thickness changes depending on where the {{PAGENAME}} is shot from. At the front, it ranges from 15-20 mm thick, although the front-facing window of the driver's hatch does only give 9 mm of armour between a machine gun round and the driver. While a 7.62 mm round will only penetrate at close range, a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun round will only fail to penetrate that window at over a kilometre away. Considering the car's most valuable advantage is its ability to get to good positions fast, an incapacitated driver will ruin the {{PAGENAME}}'s chances in the match.

The side's obvious weak spots are the grills near the front that are only 5 mm thick. Considering that the vehicle has a hexagon-shaped cross-section if sliced from left to right, the upper plate of the slanted side offers 9 mm of protection after the grill and 10-12 mm around and in front of the grill. The lower side plate gives a whole new world of armour with a minimum thickness of 10 mm everywhere, which means at least the 7.62 mm machine guns can't penetrate the car through there. The doors have the same thickness as the rest of the sides.

On the back, there's one slanted plate that is 8 mm at the top which increases to 14 mm at the bottom. Again, like the sides, the door doesn't have a different thickness. Also, the gun is very easy to disable as it has a maximum effective thickness of 88 mm, which all tanks at this BR will be able to penetrate and disable in one shot.

This tank is still very vulnerable to strafing aircraft. Bombs and rockets also deal heavy damage if the {{PAGENAME}} is standing in their destruction radius.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=248|rbMinHp=142}}

The {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility is very good. The fastest speeds it can reach will depend on the terrain: on a track like the ones on Sinai, the {{PAGENAME}} can easily reach 60 or 70 km/h, and driving on an actual road or going downhill it will reach the 80s or 90s; but on a grassy field, it may only reach up to 45 km/h. Due to the {{PAGENAME}} being a wheeled car, going through sand, snow or a small uphill will trickle away its speed. The wheeled construction means the FIAT also cannot neutral steer, but it does have a small turning circle (tank-sized) and it can turn in this circle at 23 km/h.

When reversing the {{PAGENAME}} has good acceleration as well, reaching -10 km/h after about 3 seconds and will get to -20 by the fourth second.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

{{main|M80 (12.7 mm)}}

The M80 is a spotting machine gun attached to the M40A1 recoilless rifle. The low velocity of its projectiles and limited capacity make it ineffective against enemy ground vehicles, only being able to effectively damage exposed crew members. However, the ballistics of the weapon are aligned with the gun's ballistics, meaning that it can be used to range a target, rather than using the rangefinding skill.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Ground RB/SB/AB

The FIAT is a light tank destroyer with extremely potent anti-tank grenades that are almost guaranteed to slice through any armoured foe. Never put yourself on the front lines as your armour is not up to the task against anything heavier than .30 calibre machine gun fire, so striking from the shadows is the best option. One of the main upsides is that you don't have an actual gunner who exposes themselves to fire, meaning all you have to do is find a great position and remain hull-down. Getting to said position is fairly easy if you are on a map with easily accessible roads. The FIAT 6614 will manage to reach its top speed and overtake most of the vehicles at its battle rating, use your speed to your absolute advantage, with the FIAT 6614, to maximize your effectiveness on the battlefield, you need to be in places were regular enemies won't suspect vehicles to be shot at from. Another great feature that the FIAT 6614 has access to is the scouting mechanic. Scouting will allow you to earn even more points, whilst also providing great intel for your teammates to take advantage of. Due to the excellent penetration of the both HEAT and HESH rounds, this tank destroyer is best played pointing and shooting at the target, not minding weak spots, especially due to the overpressure damage mechanic. Although some tanks will be able to survive one or two shots, generally speaking you should make quick work of anyone you encounter. If you get spotted, you should quickly disengage and move to a new spot where enemies will again not suspect you shooting from, to disengage you can use smoke grenades to cover your retreat for a short while. Always remember to stay at a safe distance, as previously mentioned you won't be able to withstand much, if anything. You'll be at the mercy of artillery strikes and enemy aircraft. It's recommended to take cover inside a building or behind a natural obstacle that will protect you from such threats. Also keep in mind that in Arcade Battles, enemies can easily find out where you are located with the nametag and are able to quickly find out where your weak spots are.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- 106 mm HESH can knock out most enemy vehicles with a single shot, except some heavy tanks
- 106 mm HEATFS is capable of frontally penetrating all tanks at its BR
- 360-degree turret traverse
- Fast on-road
- Small target, easy to hide
- The gun mounting allows you to hide the entire hull behind cover while still having the gun above cover, allowing you to engage enemies with nothing but the gun exposed
- Is amphibious

'''Cons:'''

- Very thin armour, vulnerable to machine gun fire, artillery and strafing by aircraft
- Bad off-road speed
- You cannot fire the recoilless rifle or the spotting rifle while swimming, leaving you defenceless in water

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Fiat 6614 was an APC joint venture between Fiat and OTO Melara. Post-war Italy had realized the need of having light vehicles that could easily be deployed at long distances to further support the front-line troops, without actually being in the front-line. The Fiat 6614 was specifically made to fill in the requirements of the many military and para-military organizations, where some form of mobile armoured protection is required for personnel. The first prototype was made in 1972, which underwent many changes, both aesthetic and armament-wise. An example would be such as the Fiat 6614 having access to a dual .50 cal turret, which would be ultimately removed after testing. Fiat would be in charge of the engine and the automotive components while OTO Melara was in charge of the hull and weapon system. The Fiat 6614 would be outfitted with an IVECO 8062.24 diesel engine, this allowed the Fiat 6614 to reach speeds of 100 km/h. It had a max crew of 3, but being a APC, could carry up to 10 soldiers at once. One of its staple abilities was the fact that it could be amphibious (propulsion once in the water was provided by the road wheels), which further allowed it to push itself into it being a multi-role vehicle. There was plenty of optional equipment available for the Fiat 6614, such as: recovery winch, night vision equipment, smoke grenade discharges and also an air conditioning system. Armament-wise, due to its weight, it couldn't really support heavy loads (primarily also why the Fiat 6616 was made), this didn't stop it from having a few armaments installed, one of the more obscure variants being one with a FIROS-6 rocket launcher. It's good to note that it was also marketed as a mortar carrier, medi-vac ambulance and also a reconnaissance vehicle.

This FIAT 6614 is a further development prototype for anti heavy armoured target purposes by mounting a 106 mm M40A1 recoilless rifle forward of the commander's position on the turret roof. It was only a one-off, as far as we know of, which members of the Italian military would use to evaluate its effectiveness on the field. Ultimately it wasn't picked up due to other vehicles in the Italian army being much better candidates, and also due to the M40A1 recoilless rifle getting more and more obsolete. It was able to fire M40A1 standard munitions, such as HEAT and HESH, and the rounds would be stored near the backside of the vehicle.

In terms of service, the Italian Fiat 6614 is still technically in service, inside of the 'Polizia di Stato' (State police), mainly used for riot control and during natural disasters where its amphibious abilities can come in handy. Other times it was used would be when the Italian Army deployed a number of Fiat 6614's to Bosnia and Somalia, for safekeeping. They had a huge success in the export market, one of the biggest successes being in the South Korean army. The Fiat 6614 would be license produced in South Korea, where it was widely used, although as of 2022 it's said they've completely gone out of service. The South Korean Fiat 6614 is known as the KM900, while locally introduced variants, known as the KM901 can include an armoured ambulance, mortar carriers, and command vehicles. Other countries still using it to this day include Libya, Somalia, Tunisia, Argentina, Venezuela, and Peru. Fiat 6616 also known as 'Autoblinda 1974' ([[AUBL/74]]) is a further development model of the Fiat 6614, after OTO Melara and Fiat engineers started experimenting on up-arming the Fiat 6614.
