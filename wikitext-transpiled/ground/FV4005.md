== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 "Assault"]].

The FV4005 holds the distinction of being among the largest conventional cannons available in War Thunder Ground Forces with its 183 mm calibre, as well as having a very long single-shell reload with a stock time of almost 40 seconds. It can only fire HESH (high-explosive squash head) shells and has a limited turret rotation of ±45°.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The FV4005 Stage II has essentially negligible armour, due to the gigantic turret providing only 14 mm of protection from any given angle. Due to this and the vehicle's crew being largely based in the turret, the FV4005 is extremely vulnerable to even .50 calibre machine guns, and any large calibre explosives can and will inflict overpressure damage on them, which is always fatal.

The only redeeming trait in regards to survivability is that the crew may survive some side-on attacks due to the sheer size of the gun breech. Regardless, an FV4005 player should not count on surviving anything bar the lightest of machine gun fire.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=923|rbMinHp=575}}

The {{PAGENAME}} doesn't represent anything special in terms of mobility; the vehicle utilises a Centurion hull and retains most of the same characteristics, including the somewhat sub-par reverse speed. Hull traverse times are reasonable, but not exceptional, and maximum forwards speed is a limited 28 km/h in RB/SB.

Due to the vehicle's limited mobility, players should play conservatively, avoiding flanking routes and any areas where there is no immediate escape route available. The Tracks upgrade is particularly valuable on the {{PAGENAME}}, as due to its limited turret traverse distance the improved hull traverse will on occasion be a saving grace.

{{main|QF L4A1 (183 mm)}}

The FV4005 Stage II sports one of the largest cannons available in War Thunder Ground Forces, the 183 mm QF L4A1, with the second longest single-shell base reload time of any vehicle, at 38.9 seconds. The L4A1 is restricted to the use of HESH only, due to the weapon originally being envisaged as an anti-emplacement howitzer. 

HESH has slower fuse than HE and HEAT and won't detonate on most foliage, but it cannot penetrate more than one layer of armour, so it can be blocked by side skirts and, sometimes, even by chassis or machine guns. Despite problems with penetration of the countermeasures, HESH can be used to great effect against almost any possible target, provided shots are placed well - ideally on angled side armour, while ensuring the armour isn't angled enough to bounce and isn't protected by an additional layer. 

HESH could also be placed straight on top of the target crew compartment, as long as it is strong enough to break through the armour (generally, angled frontal armour is only built with kinetic shells and HE in mind) and isn't blocked by internal modules. In the case of the L1 shell, which the FV4005 uses, even the frontal hull armour of the [[Maus]] is not enough to sustain a direct hit.

Despite the size and weight of the L1 round, it has reasonable ballistics at 716 m/s velocity. Due to a colossal explosive power, even if the shell misses it will sometimes destroy tanks with overpressure damage and create holes in the ground. Maximum penetration and effective range of the explosion effect are difficult to measure.

HESH round performance improves, within reason, when targets are angled. This is due to the squash head the rounds are tipped by - on larger angles the head will squash further and result in more internal damage. However, the improvements with angling are limited once the rounds reach their ricochet angles - past 73° of angling the rounds have a chance to bounce. As such it's best to limit rounds to less than 70° where possible.

'''Notes''':

* The FV4005 has extremely limited ammunition, with a maximum of 12 rounds. Despite this, it's no mean feat to run out of ammo due to the extended reload time.
* Projectiles and propellant bags are modeled individually and disappear as soon as they're loaded/fired.
* Projectiles racks empty from back to front.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|L3A1 (7.62 mm)}}

The FV4005's coaxial machine gun is of limited value; it should be used to clear small obstacles or if possible crew members in open-top vehicles. It can be used as a ranging machine gun while keeping in mind that the main weapon's ballistics do not follow the machine gun's trajectory exactly as the MG has a slightly higher round velocity.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The main in-game use of this tank is the elimination of hull-down tanks (similar to [[T30]]), super-armoured heavy tanks in general (similar to [[IS-7]]), well-armoured SPG's (similar to [[Ho-Ri_Production|Ho-Ri]]) and the likes of them. Meanwhile, you still can help your team by hiding around and eliminating reckless rushers in 1 hit, when they aren't looking.

Your main goal in between your hunts is to survive and stay hidden, as you only have enough armour to stop 7.62 mm machine guns, and your reloading time is exceptionally long, especially if you lose either of the loaders. Contrary to popular belief, if you aim poorly with FV4005 it does not knock anything out of existence with a single shot anyway. You should first get out of your cover (or wait for the enemy to get into your firing lines), then take aim at the enemy, and only then fire. HESH shell will do the rest for you if your aim and weak spot suggestion was correct.

Weak spots depend on the mode you play in. As an example, for most Soviet tanks, the frontal weak spot is the left side of the hull (for you - right side). It's also possible to target the back of their turrets in Realistic battle. However, if you fire at back of the turret of IS-2 in arcade mode, it may still survive with just 1 crew member (driver with very high "vitality" level), go into "last stand" mode, turn its turret and fire back at you. As such, try to aim at places, from which spalling can definitely hit every last crew member.

Likewise, in Arcade mode, it's not enough to just eliminate crew in your turret, and your driver is hidden in the decently armoured hull. However, if your FV4005 is attacked by explosives from 105+ mm gun, it will likely be overpressurized and destroyed. If the gun breech is hit and damaged, there is also a chance that the shell inside will also be destroyed, and you won't be able to avenge yourself even if you manage to repair before a follow up shot.

HESH shells have a slow fuse, which does not react to literally every obstacle it hits, unlike with the HEAT or HE, sometimes allowing FV4005 to fire through some foliage, flimsy fences and the likes. While it does not look very useful at first, it can be especially beneficial in Arcade mode or in some specific sniper setup, as AB players are often extremely uncomfortable with firing without aim assist confirmation, which is easily prevented by obstacles such as a weak metal fence built around a capture point, while you can learn the gun ballistics and train yourself to fire by using distance indicators and tank profile (use "select" hotkey, which is by default set to mouse wheel, to see hostile tank overall size and position) instead, to surprise them and thus avoid return fire.

Going into sniper duels without preparations, like rangefinding and adjusting the gun beforehand, with this tank is ill-advised, as any sniper tank needs significantly less time to aim at you, due to the fact that your turret cannot turn freely, your enormous profile, and faster flying ammunition types. They also can destroy you in 1 hit as well, by hitting your ammo, or even by causing the turret to explode without engaging it directly, particularly noticeable with ATGM tanks like [[Type 60 ATM]].

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Armed with the gigantic 183 mm cannon
* 183 mm HESH will cause the spalling of enemy armour that is 228 mm thick or less. Devastating to even the most heavily armoured tanks
* Large gun breech can potentially protect some of the turret crew from incoming fire and shrapnel.
* The co-axial machine gun has a very similar trajectory to the 183 mm gun, making it ideal for ranging.
* Has the hull of a centurion, it will block or deflect shots and explosions which missed the turret with modest efficiency
* L1 shell can damage the ground, but the tank reloads so slowly, that there has to be multiple of FV4005, or the match has to be stalled for quite long for them to do any strategically significant damage

'''Cons:'''

* Huge turret with only 14 mm of armour all around. Can be shredded by .50 cal machine guns and auto cannons, vulnerable even to HEAT overpressure damage if hit
* Lots of ammo lining the entire turret which can be detonated with little effort
* 4 of the 5 crew members are in turret. An APHE penetration or overpressure will likely knock out the tank
* HESH is inherently unreliable, a hit to a wrong spot on certain enemy tank chassis or armour may do no damage at all despite shell's potential, while a close miss might annihilate enemy tank regardless
* Carries only 12 shells
* Due to the thin turret armour and sheer size of the tank, is a prime target for AA guns and all aircraft at the BR
* Turret cannot traverse a full 360 degrees, you'll need to traverse the entire tank left or right to engage enemies on your flanks or rear
* Incredibly long reload time, a knocked out or injured loader can easily push the reload time over 1 minute

Work started on a 180 mm self-propelled gun in 1950 by Nuffield Mechanizations & Aero. Designated the ''FV215B'', the plan was to mount the gun onto the Conqueror hull.<ref name="Ware pg79">Ware 2012a, p. 79</ref> It was intended for the three trial vehicles to be built from the span of 1951-1955. The project was cancelled in early 1957 with no prototypes produced.<ref name="Ware pg80">Ware 2012a, p. 80</ref>

During the development phase of the FV215B, another project was done on the [[Centurion Mk 3|Centurion]].<ref name="Ware pg80" /> Labeled the '''FV4005''', it was an attempt to mount the 180 mm on the Centurion hull. The design phase is distinctive in two parts, Stage I and II. Stage I had the gun mounted on an open-topped hull. The gun had a concentric recoil system and an auto-loader. '''Stage II''' had the gun encased in a lightly armoured, splinter-proof turret with a conventional recoil system and manual loading.<ref name="Ware pg78">Ware 2012a, p. 78</ref><ref name="Ware pg109">Ware 2012b, p. 109</ref>

In December 1952, the 180 mm gun was increased into a 183 mm gun mounting. Though a single prototype was made for testing, the project never passed basic feasibility. In August 1957, the project was abandoned as well.<ref name="Ware pg78" /><ref name="Ware pg109" /> The lone prototype is currently stationed outside at Bovington Tank Museum.
