Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Freccia IFV, made by Iveco and OTO Melara, was an Italian IFV designed to meet a new requirement from the Italian army for a new modern vehicle that would be able to successfully replace the obsolete fleet of VCC-2 APCs that had been serving in the Italian armed forces for many years. Iveco and OTO Melara would eventually design something closely based on the Centauro family of vehicles, which would end up being known as the Freccia. It would enter service in 2009 and continues to serve today in a multitude of locations where the Italian army is stationed.

Introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]], the main defining feature of the Freccia is the new turret which is able to mount Spike fire-and-forget ATGMs. The main con when playing the Freccia is the big profile, you are very limited in how you can hide this machine. Fighting in close proximity to enemy vehicles is also not the best, the Spikes are mid-to-long range weapons, at close range the Spike cannot effectively lock onto enemy tanks, and for the missile to actually hit the target there has to be some considerable distance between players. This is why playing as a sniper is recommended. The Spike missile can lock onto enemy aircraft too but they need to be very close and flying relatively slowly in comparison to the missile for it to reach the target. Mobility-wise, you will not be lacking on maps with roads, but take note of areas with mud/snow as they will make the Freccia go slower. Armour-wise, the Freccia is actually surprisingly good for an IFV, it can withstand low-level autocannon fire and enemy tank shells if they hit an area of the platform with empty space. Overall the Freccia is a solid addition to any top tier Italian ground forces lineup.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Mobile platform
* Access to fire-and-forget Spike-MR missiles
* Can fire ATGMs on the move
* Armoured enough to allow it to withstand autocannon fire
* Fast firing 25 mm Oerlikon cannon equipped with APFSDS
* Due to the layout of the vehicle, at times thanks to the empty space enemy rounds will not damage you

'''Cons:'''

* Big profile
* Firing Spike ATGMs requires a lock
* Firing at enemies directly behind is an issue if you need to depress your cannon
* Crew layout in the turret can be a problem as enemies can 1 shot you at times
* Due to being wheeled, sometimes when encountering mud or snow you may not be as mobile

The story of the Freccia IFV began during the late stages of the Cold war. The Italian army had always seen a need for well-armed wheeled vehicles, so during the Cold War, OTO Melara assisted by Iveco had been working on many different wheeled designs, mainly made in hopes that the Italian army or foreign armies would put said designs into service. Their main goal was to bridge the gap between conventional IFVs and APCs by combining the two. A few designs were created, the first being the B1 Centauro IFVs (also known as Centauro VBC), which would be armed with either a 60 mm HVMS or a 20/25 mm autocannon with ATGMs, primarily based directly on the pre-existing Centauro series of vehicles. Instead of the usual 105 mm Hitfact turret, the vehicle would be modified to allow infantry on board and the installation of conventional IFV turrets. Although interest had been shown, the market during those times was too diluted with the latest designs, and also due to the overwhelming influx of surplus vehicles from nations such as America, would eventually lead to these vehicles to not get picked up.

This didn't stop OTO Melara or Iveco from continuing to work on a new design, however. Years later, the Italian army had set out a new requirement for a new modern vehicle that would be able to successfully replace the obsolete fleet of VCC-2 APCs that had been serving in the Italian armed forces for many years. They decided to go back to the tried and tested design of the B1 Centauro, but unlike the previous attempts, made sure this time that the vehicle was highly modified and had the ability to remain in service for many years ahead, creating the Freccia IFV. Improvements included better armour, better fire control systems, and the integration of an ATGM launcher. For the very first prototypes of the Freccia, the TC-25 Hitfist turret that equipped the Dardo IFV would be installed, becoming known as [[VBC (PT2)]]. After many tests and the evaluation from the army, that initial design did not stick, likely due to the turret not being very modern, considering it had been designed during the Cold War. Instead, an entirely new turret would be designed from scratch, retaining the same Oerlikon KBA 25 mm automatic cannon but with the option to also include larger calibres such as 30 mm and 40 mm cannons. The new turret was simply named 'Hitfist' (also named Hitfist 25 with 25 mm or Hitfist 30 with 30 mm). The turret structure of the Hitfist would be made of ballistic aluminium alloy with integrated spall liner. In addition, add-on armour was also installed to reach the required ballistic protection level according to STANAG 4569. This turret also had the ability for Spike fire-and-forget ATGMs to be installed, which made the Freccia stand out from its competitors at the time as it wasn't a common occurrence. It gained enough interest for the Italian army to award Iveco and OTO Melara a contract to produce these vehicles for the Italian armed forces.

They were ordered in 2006, first introduced in 2009, and primarily used by the Mechanized Brigade "Pinerolo". The Freccia IFV was the first digitized vehicle to enter service in the Italian army, the Italian government ordered a first batch of 249 Freccia, which would all be delivered by 6 June 2017. The Freccia would also be modified, and would spawn new variants such as Mortar carrier,command post, APC, and scout. In terms of mobility, the Freccia IFV is wheeled, and uses the IVECO Diesel 5HP-1500 V6 engine, which produces 550hp, this allows the vehicle to reach speeds of 110 km/h with an overall range of up to 800 km. Armament-wise, as previously mentioned it is equipped with a 25mm auto cannon, and in its anti-tank variant, it installs the Israeli-made Spike, 2 which would be ready to fire, while another 8 missiles are stowed inside the hull. The scout version of this vehicle removed the ATGMs in favour of launchers for the Italian-made 'Horus' drone mounted on the turret. This drone has primarily been used for scouting, and has also previously been seen on Italian army vehicles, such as the C1 Ariete and B1 Centauro da 120. OTO Melara has also shown off a variant of the Freccia IFV mounting the Hitfist 30 mm OWS, which replaces the old 25 mm turret with an unmanned turret mounting a 30 mm autocannon, and an ATGM launcher which can use Kornet, Spike, and Ingwe ATGMs. This variant has mainly been an option for export, this was further proved when Russia showed an interest in acquiring a multitude of the Centauro family variants, which included the Freccia. When Italy sent over the vehicles, one of the Freccias there mounted the 30 mm. The Italian army at one point showed interest in this version, but ultimately did not pick it. Lastly, in terms of upgrade programs, the Freccia IFV is currently undergoing a mid-life update to its FCS and other electronic equipment. It is also planned in the future for it to install some sort of active protection system to further increase the survival of the crew and vehicle. Overall the vehicle has proved to be very effective and continues to serve in the Italian army, and likely will for many years to come.

The Freccia VBM (Veicolo Blindato Medio - “medium armored vehicle”) Infantry fighting vehicle was built on the chassis of the Centauro B1 tank destroyer and designed to support these vehicles on the battlefield. The Freccia VBM has a modified Hifist Plus turret, a further development of the Dardo IFV turret. The turret is equipped with a 25-mm Oerlikon cannon, on the sides of the turret are launchers for Israeli-made Spike missiles. The vehicle has been in service with the Italian army since 2009.
