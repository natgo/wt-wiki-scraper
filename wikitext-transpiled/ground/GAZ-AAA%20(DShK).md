== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (a [[DShK (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm DShK gun]] mounted on a GAZ-AAA truck) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.63 "Desert Hunters"]].

The big brother to the [[GAZ-AAA (4M)]], it presents a crude set-up of a [[DShK (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm DShK]] mount to a 6x4 GAZ-AAA truck chassis. This soviet improvisation continues with the Soviet SPAA trend of attaching anti-aircraft weaponry to trucks, [[ZiS-43|half-tracks]], and [[BTR-152A|cars]] in the game.

Although the {{Specs|name}} continues to use the same unarmoured but nimble platform as its predecessor, the change in armament allows it to do more damage per shot against aircraft opponents as well as having a change at killing lightly armoured vehicles that are common at such BR. However the change in armament also represents a decrease volume of fire as well as an increase in reload and a smaller magazine, all of which makes it all the harder to hit enemy planes as well as requiring more rigorous aiming when it comes to attacking lightly armoured vehicles. While the {{Specs|name}} can penetrate targets, it still is not recommended to rush into battles due to the lack of protection of the vehicle and the mediocre penetration. The vehicle is better suited for ambushing unexpected targets and hit and run tactics. One must note however that unlike the [[GAZ-AAA (4M)]], the {{Specs|name}} cannot fully traverse its gun due to the ammo box located next to the driver's cabin.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
This vehicle lacks any form of armour. Any light machine gun can penetrate the vehicle and knock out the crew (the gunner is completely exposed). Artillery strikes, bombs and rockets can cause critical damage even if they land far away from the vehicle.

The only benefit of being so light is that enemies using APHE rounds will often overpenetrate and not detonate. However, it is very easy to destroy this vehicle with high-explosive shells through the overpressure mechanic (and at this BR, many guns are equipped with such shells).

'''Armour type:'''

* Structural steel (truck chassis, driver's cabin, engine hood)
* Wood (truck bed floor)
* Wheel (tires)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=71|rbMinHp=44}}

The mobility of the GAZ-AAA (DShK) is mediocre at best. Similar to the preceding GAZ-AAA (4M), the GAZ-AAA (DShK) does reach an impressive ~40 km/h on hard surfaces (e.g. grass, dirt, concrete, etc), and is quite agile in turning. The acceleration on these surfaces is average. These pros, however, are outweighed by cons such as the poor brakes. It takes around a whopping 4 seconds to reach a complete stop which is a disadvantage in cramped conditions like urban environments, causing it to drive over desired cover or to bump into walls/teammates. It also has very poor reverse speed of only -5 km/h, putting the player at great risk when needing to retreat back to safety. Due to the low engine power, it is hard or impossible to crush obstacles like stone fences or light poles which further limits its mobility in an urban battlefield. Finally, just like most other wheeled vehicles, it shares the poor mobility on soft terrain like mud and sand, especially when accelerating, making itself an easy target for strafing aircraft.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|T|Tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|IAI|Immediate-action incendiary}} - The belt consists of 3 different type of ammunition. {{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}} ammunition is useful to put enemy planes on fire. {{Annotation|T|Tracer}} helps lead your shots while the {{Annotation|IAI|Immediate-action incendiary}} can be useful against less armoured aircraft. The lack of {{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}} found on other belts, limits its effectiveness against ground targets, reducing it to mostly vehicles with exposed crew.
* '''API:''' {{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} - Unlike the default belt, the API belt consists of 2 types of bullets. {{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}} can penetrate most opponents frontally due to how unarmoured vehicles are at such Battle Rating. {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} on the other hand, sacrifices penetration in favor of having an incendiary and a tracer component. This can prove to be very useful when engaging enemy aircraft as it can easily set them on fire. The belt's composition of 50% {{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}} and 50% {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} allows the vehicle to engage air vehicles as effectively as ground ones.
* '''AP:''' {{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} - While the AP belt shares the same bullet types as the API and API-T belts, the bullet ratio of 2/3 {{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}} and 1/3 {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} is better suited to engage ground vehicles. That said the belt's {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} gives it enough flexibility to engage air targets.
* '''API-T:''' {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}} - The API-T belt on the other hand, while sharing the same bullet types as the API and AP belts, has an inverted bullet than that of AP: 2/3 {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} and 1/3 {{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}} - While such belt composition is better suited to engage air vehicles, the inclusion of {{Annotation|AP-I(c)|Armour-piercing incendiary (cermet core)}} allows the player to easily defend themselves against enemy tanks.

;Combat tactics

Potentially the most challenging SPAA to use in the game, due to the machine gun's low rate of fire making it relatively ineffective against aircraft, however, it can work in part as a basic tank destroyer and support vehicle.

For anti-air duties, the GAZ-AAA (DShK) is harder to use than the previous SPAA despite having a more powerful gun. The 12.7 mm MG traverses very slowly for an SPAA, has a limited elevation angle and cannot aim backwards. These limitations severely impact the anti-air capability since the player have to constantly adjust the hull position just to get the gun on target. The best way to use this SPAA is to lure enemy planes into head-ons since little to no lead is required, compensating your low fire density and fire rate. First find yourself a solid cover, hide the driving compartment behind it and expose only the gunner. As an enemy plane nears, fire single shots towards it to draw its attention. If it starts to dive on you, open fire immediately, aim slightly up between the top of its fuselage and the tip of the vertical stabiliser. If the gunner is not knocked out, unload the entire box of ammo to the target. As you reload it might just be turning back for another pass, try crippling it more with another box of bullets. A few hits from the DShK should badly damage a fighter (e.g. [[He 112 (Family)|He 112]]) around this BR, however a bomber/attacker (e.g. [[Do 17 Z-7|Do 17 Z]], [[Ju 87 (Family)|Ju 87]]) is generally more durable and can take more hits. If you see or hear a bomb falling from the plane, immediately hide behind cover, as even the smallest fragment can easily kill your poorly protected crew, or damage your tires or your engine.

For anti-tank duties, the key will be to stick to your team and take out the crew of an enemy tank and then let the dedicated tanks finish them off with their harder-hitting rounds. It is best to use the API or AP belts since they contain the highest percentage of armour-piercing cermet core bullets. The 29 mm penetration of these bullets at point blank range is enough to pierce through the front/sides of common tanks such as [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]], [[Pz.IV C]], [[LVT(A)(1)|LVT(A)]], etc. Note that you cannot spray bullets, because one magazine only holds 50 rounds which is not a lot, so aim carefully and shoot 1-3 round bursts for taking out crew members. Just remember this only works on all but the most lightly armoured targets, such as other SPAA, early German tanks and the side of some American tanks, this works best when your vehicle is down-tiered and not the other way around.

;Enemies worth noting

* [[Ju 87 B-2|Ju 87 B2]]: this early Stuka is able to carry some very threatening bombs of up to 500kg. With the bombs it can easily destroy a GAZ-AAA (DShK) even if the bomb lands far away, due to the very thin armour protection of the SPAA. Its 2 x 7.92 mm MG, although weak, are still more than enough to knock out the completely exposed and not protected gunner, making the GAZ defenceless. It is best to target the Stuka's nose, where the engine and cooling systems are located. With an overheating/damaged engine, a Stuka will experience significantly worse flight performance which makes it easy for you or a friendly plane to destroy it.
* [[M13 MGMC]]: this SPAA can wipe out the GAZ within a second as it has a pair of fast-firing and heavy-punching .50 cals. Fortunately your DShK is also able to penetrate through its armour with ease. In an encounter with an M13, try your best to get your shots off first. Aim for its gun mount and disable its ability to fire, then go for the driver compartment to destroy it.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Weapon has increased penetration and damage output compared to the preceding GAZ-AAA (4M)
* Quite fast on hard roads, topping at ~45 km/h
* Small profile from all angle, hard to get spotted
* Thin armour will not trigger most fused shells, causing over-penetration and thus little damage

'''Cons:'''

* Vehicle armament consists of only a single 600 RPM machine gun
* Limited magazine of 50 rounds means the armament has to reload frequently
* Gunner can't swivel around 360 degrees horizontally
* Limited vertical traverse
* Will struggle to eliminate passing aircraft due to a low volume of fire
* No armour, can easily be destroyed even by .30 cal machine guns
* Subject to overpressure damage from HE shells

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Around the late 1920s, the Soviet Union was undergoing a mechanization revolution and realized that no purpose-built motor vehicles were available for them to help move cargo and materiel back and forth. The result was the GAZ-AAA truck, which was a truck based on the Ford Model AAA 6 x 4 truck. These trucks entered production in 1932 and were used in multiple roles in the civilian world and in the military.

In the military, the GAZ trucks were used as tractors for gun systems, fuel tankers, radio systems, and even armoured cars. By 1931, an anti-aircraft version was created as well, in order to give the Soviet Union a mobile anti-aircraft system to work with. The design had one DShK heavy machine gun installed on a mount on the truck. This configuration was called the '''DShK GAZ-AAA''' and served as a low-altitude air defence system.

Old and reliable .50 cal proved to be good at harassing low flying planes, infantry, and German APCs, but it became apparent that a more powerful gun was needed.

DShK proved its worthiness on many occasions, but a new anti-aircraft system had to be devised for the role of a mobile anti-aircraft system. This led to the development of the [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]], which while still truck-mounted weaponry, had a noticeable increase in firepower with a 25 mm autocannon.
