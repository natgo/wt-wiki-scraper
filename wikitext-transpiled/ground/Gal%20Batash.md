The Magach 6B Gal Batash was an upgrade present in a small number of Magach 6B Gal tanks, the idea of this upgrade was to increase firepower, protection and improve optics and electronics without affecting the mobility of the tank. The Magach 6B Gal Batash remained in low intensity service, since it was meant to complement the lack of Merkava tanks in rearguard and reserve units. The Magach 6B Gal Batash used the same fire control system as the Magach 6B Gal, that is, the "Gal" fire control system. To combat the added weight, a new engine was installed with 908hp. This model only saw limited production and was considered one of the most modern israeli tanks in service when it came out.

It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]]. The Magach 6B Gal Batash plays like most M60 tanks that rely heavily in it's fire control system and firepower. Much like other M48/M60 platforms with modernized armour and weaponry like the Magach 7C, the M48 Super, the M60A3 TTS and the CM11, the Magach 6B Gal Batash has a weak engine, with mediocre acceleration, poor reverse speed but being superior to tanks like the T-64 and T-72. This means that it relies on good positioning, target acquisition and precise shots to stay relevant in the battlefield, since it's ofter overshadowed by tanks like the Leopard 1 that are more mobile and multirole thanks to their good mobility. Still the Magach 6B Gal Batash has a good enough armour in the turret, specially to stop tandem shaped warheads and older ATGMs launched from helicopters or IFVs. It's also very resistent against shots from autocannons but APDS and APFSDS projectiles can still go trough it's armour in weak areas.

The Magach 6B Gal Batash is rather unique compared to other M60 variants, in the sense that it is one of the few versions to have composite armour protecting any part of the tank. With this said, it's still an M60, so brawling will not be especially effective, as most enemies will penetrate your armour without issue. The best "safe" use of the Gal Batash will be to utilize the good gunner sight to snipe enemies at range. The M426 round has very respectable stats for this BR, and since it's an M60, your height will make it slightly easier to look over hills and terrain. Alternatively, one can flank the enemy, taking enemy light vehicles by surprise and protecting your teammates from enemy flanking manoeuvres, whilst simultaneously holding the ability to attack enemy MBTs from the side. This tactic is generally reliable on maps with lots of foliage on the flanks, especially in up-tiers, where the effectiveness of your APFSDS round will be immensely diminished by the improved armour of your foes.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has access to the potent M426 APFSDS round
* Good power-to-weight ratio because of the more powerful engine
* LWS provides advance warning for enemy range finding, as well as laser guided ATGMs, bombs, etc.

'''Cons:'''

* Poor survivability due to cramped interior and ammo storage layout
* Composite does not stop most APFSDS rounds effectively
* Poor gun handling
* Track and diesel engine noise will often telegraph your position to nearby enemies

The Magach 6B Gal Batash was a limited production upgrade of the Magach 6B Gal, which in itself was an upgrade to the fire control system and electronics of the Magach 6B. As said earlier, the Magach 6B Gal Batash uses the "Gal" fire control system, also known in international markets as "Matador" which was the name employed by Israel to sell it to outside customers.

The fire control system was the same used in early Merkava tanks, and the objective of this upgrade was to update several Magach tanks, since it was obvious that the Merkava wouldn't be available for all units and many rearguard and reserve units needed more modern tanks in case of conflict with neighbour nations. The Magach 6B Gal Batash incorporated several upgrades but since the electronics and optics remained largely the same, must upgrades were appointed to the protection and crew safety.

With more powerful anti tank guns like guided ATGMs and tandem shaped warheads for RPGs available for militias in Palestine and Lebanon, the Magach tanks and their Blazer ERA were deemed too weak. Thus a new upgrade was planned to deal with this threat. A set of more modern armour developed by the IMI was installed, based in the spaced armour used in Merkava tanks, both composite screens for the turret and side skirts as well as new ERA blocks in front of the hull. Also more mine protection was added in the form of thicker belly and side armour to resist IEDs

Since the tank's weight increased a new powerplant was installed . It received a 908hp version of the older AVDS diesel called AVDS-1790-5A with the same transmission as used on the Merkava MK.1 tank. The suspension was also upgraded, using a lighter one, very similar to the one fitted in the Merkava.

It was called "Batash" an acronym that refers to "Overall Security
