== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

Shortly after the introduction of the M113, Israel became one of the largest users of this vehicle. With over 6,000 vehicles acquired over the years from the US, the M113 became one of the most common vehicles in IDF service, being capable of fulfilling multiple roles such as APC, IFV, ATGM carrier, and Short Range Air Defence vehicle. '''Giraf''' was the name given by the Israeli Defence Force to the M113A1 carrying a TOW missile launcher. Countries like the United States, Italy, and Taiwan were already experienced with this system and many M113 were modified to serve as tank destroyers using the TOW missile. The vehicle served with Israel until the introduction of the Spike anti-tank guided missile, which was also fitted to the M113 under the name "Hafiz".

It was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]]. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is very similar to other ATGM carriers in-game. It uses the BGM-71C I-TOW anti-tank guided missile as its main armament. With access to a coaxial 12.7 mm heavy machine gun and 10 rounds for its main armament, it has a very good gun depression with -20° and the missiles have a good speed of almost 300 metres per second and a decent range of almost 4 kilometres. Like most M113s, the Giraf is not very mobile and in fact is outmatched by many other ATGM carriers like the [[AMX-13 (HOT)]], and the protection is nothing special, being very vulnerable to 20 mm or 14.5 mm autocannon shots. Thus, it should be played very passively, staying behind the cover of hills and teammates.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Like other anti-tank guided missile carriers on the M113 platform, this vehicle is not very survivable, in fact it is vulnerable to even relatively weak projectiles from 14.5 mm and 20 mm guns. The crew compartment is very crammed and a single shot from a tank or missile is often enough to destroy the vehicle. But even with that into consideration, the launcher is separated from the hull of the vehicle and it can be used to hide the main body while launching from above obstacles and hills.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful ATGM, can penetrate most tanks at the BR range
* ATGM can overpressure lightly armoured tanks and open-tops
* ATGM can be manually guided to destroy helicopters

'''Cons:'''

* Very weak armour, extremely vulnerable to 12.7mm and autocannons
* ATGM cannot go through fences and other obstacles due to HEAT warhead
