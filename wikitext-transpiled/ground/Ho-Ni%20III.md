== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|三式砲戦車「ホニIII」|San-Shiki Hō-Sensha [Ho-Ni III]}}) was a tank destroyer developed by Japan during World War II. It was equipped with a [[Type 3 (75 mm)|Type 3 75 mm tank gun]], which had a high muzzle velocity and could penetrate the armour of US tanks. Unlike its predecessors, the Ho-Ni III had a fully enclosed and armoured casemate that provided protection to the crew from ground and aerial threats. The vehicle was designed to supplement the newer [[Chi-Nu|Type 3 Chi-Nu]] tanks by converting the obsolete [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Type 97 Chi-Ha]] hulls into self-propelled guns. The production of the Ho-Ni III started in 1944, but only 31 units were completed due to material shortages and bombing. Most of these vehicles were stationed in the Japanese home islands and never saw combat.

The Ho-Ni III was introduced along with the initial Japanese ground tree in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]]. It is similar to the [[Ho-Ni I|Type 1 Ho-Ni I]], but improved: more crew members, a shorter reload time, and armour for the gun crew. However this comes at the cost of a lower top speed. The gun has high penetration and damage, so enemies can be easily sniped from afar. The armour is weak and most enemies can pierce it easily. Help allies by giving fire support, and use smoke shells to create temporary cover.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Having 25 mm of armour coverage around the entire gun crew, the {{PAGENAME}} no longer needs to fear artillery shrapnel or strafing runs from fighter aircraft. Do note however that it's still vulnerable to bombs, rockets and direct artillery hits! However, if the {{PAGENAME}} takes a hit, likely to survive with more operational crewmembers, as three of them must be knocked out before the vehicle becomes inoperable.

Another small armour increase is seen on the front of the tank, with the driver and radio station protected with another 10 mm of armour, though with this added strength, it still leaves an undesirable total width of a lacking 35 mm.

'''Armour type:'''

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and tracks are both 15 mm thick.
* Driver's port on the front plate is 10 mm thick.
* An extra 10 mm of armour is plated on top of the bow machine gun area, left from the driver's position.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 241|rbMinHp= 150}}

The only drawback of the {{PAGENAME}} compared to its previous version, is that the tank has a slight decrease in top speed. On flat terrain, it reaches a top speed of 32 km/h, compared to the Ho-Ni I's top speed of 36 km/h.

{{main|Type 3 (75 mm)}}

The {{PAGENAME}} features a modernized Type 3 75 mm tank gun, based on the [[Type 90 (75 mm)|75 mm Type 90]] field gun as on the previous Ho-Ni I, still being a great cannon, even with a slightly higher battle rating. With the addition of two dedicated loaders in a fully closed casemate, the gun also gets almost a second cut down on its reload time, making it capable of even more destruction.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} plays very similar to the [[Ho-Ni I]] with the added benefit of two extra crew which cuts down on the reload time for the 75 mm gun.

The starting Japanese player will also be quite accustomed to the handling of the hull, as it still is based on the [[Chi-Ha]]. But due to the added weight of the fully enclosed casemate, it is slower compared to its brother [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Chi-Ha]].

With the added benefit of the casemate and crew, the {{PAGENAME}} sports better survivability, though, most shells will not knock you out in one shot due to having a total of five crew members. The crew isn't out in the open anymore and has sufficient armour from machine-gun fire from both ground & air enemies. Knowing this, you can stand to take more chances of sitting in one location and not have to worry about aircraft making a single pass and taking the vehicle out.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Effective 75 mm gun with APHE can penetrate all enemies at its rank
* The -10° of gun depression allows the Ho-Ni III to shoot from the cover of ridgelines or downwards from an elevated position
* Fully enclosed crew compartment provides better protection from strafing aircraft
* Five-man crew allows three members to be knocked out and still allows the tank to function
* Has access to smoke shells which can help hide yourself or blind an enemy

'''Cons:'''

* The thin armour makes the vehicle less effective in close-quarters engagements
* Four of the crew are close together leaving them vulnerable to being knocked out by a single shot
* Having no machine gun, the Ho-Ni III will have difficulty to disable vehicles without armour like the [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]]
* Limited traverse of the gun forces you to turn the vehicle to cover wider fields of fire

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Type 3 Ho-Ni III is a self-propelled anti-tank artillery gun. The Ho-Ni III was the third of the Japanese 'tank destroyers', which Japan developed based on inspiration from the German tanks of this class. This SPG was very similar to the previous models of this series, the Ho-Ni I and Ho-Ni II, but surpassed them in multiple ways, embodying all the very best of each of them. The chassis of the medium Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai tank was used as a base, while the Ho-Ni I and II used a simple, unmodernized version of the Type 97 Chi-Ha. The powerful 75 mm Type 90 field cannon was chosen as a gun. In its design, this was a counterpart of the French 85 mm Schneider cannon (85 mle 1927 Schneider). After a small redesign for installation on the tank, this gun was designated the Type 3. The cannon was installed in an armoured non-rotating superstructure which, in contrast to the Ho-Ni I and Ho-Ni II, was fully enclosed on all sides and provided optimal protection for the crew. Additional ammo took the place of the machine gun in the hull, and the SPG's crew was reduced to four (in comparison to the five of the previous vehicles in this series).

Ho-Ni series SPGs went into production in 1942, and the order to design and produce the upgraded Ho-Ni III was received by the Hitachi firm in the beginning of 1944. Due to a shortage of resources and constant bombings, the Japanese industry was only able to produce roughly 35 Ho-Ni III SPGs before the end of the war. Most of them were distributed among divisions tasked with defending Japan itself, while only a few were sent to areas of active military operations such as Okinawa and the Philippines. No records survive of military clashes between the Ho-Ni III and American tanks.
