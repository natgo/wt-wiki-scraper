The '''Experimental Type 5 Gun Tank (Ho-Ri)''' ({{Annotation|試製五式砲戦車 「ホリ」|Shisei Go Shiki Hō-Sensha [Ho-Ri]}}) was one of 3 tank designs for a new Japanese tank destroyer housing the new powerful Type 5 105 mm anti-tank gun to deal with the heaviest of Allied armour the US might throw at the Japanese mainland. This Ho-Ri was the final design out of the 3: unlike the 2 previous designs, it was not directly based on the [[Chi-Ri II|Chi-Ri]], but only a hull based on the Chi-Ri, featuring the same engine but with a sloped front hull design to increase armour effectiveness.

The {{PAGENAME}} was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/4976-shop-the-new-e-r-a-bundles-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]] and was removed from sale after the [[wt:en/news/6542-shop-the-new-year-sale-en|2019 New Year sale]]. It later returned for purchase in-game with Golden Eagles {{ge}} during the [[wt:en/news/6694-shop-may-sale-in-war-thunder-en|2020 May sale]]. While very similar to the [[Ferdinand]], it does differ slightly. While the hull of the Ho-Ri provides the same armour effectiveness of around ~200 mm, with the lower front plate being a weakness to lose driver, radio operator, and transmission, the superstructure of the tank only maxes out at 150 mm effective, with the cheeks only protecting up to 125 mm being relatively easy to penetrate for its opponents. The best course of action is to hull down the tank and peek over ridges while using its -10° depression to increase its armour effectiveness and play it in a safe sniping position. The trade-off of superstructure armour gets rewarded in forward mobility going up to 40 km/h relatively quickly. A special feature of the Ho-Ri is its elevating roof armour, to reduce its vertical silhouette, the cannon breech can elevate up, pushing the roof with it, to allow for the -10° depression it offers, this will expose the crew members but won't be much of a threat as it's a very narrow-angle for planes to strafe through, and it doesn't cause the crew to be affected by explosive overpressure.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ho-Ri can be used in multiple roles. Its most effective at medium range, where it's harder for the enemy to aim for the lower plate and shells have a harder time penetrating the mantlet, making it easy for you to destroy them. Another option, although risky is to sit on a road that players like to go down and use your armour to bounce and take shot and return fire on enemy tanks.

'''Enemies worth noting''':

* [[IS-2]] / [[IS-2 (1944)]] / [[ISU-122]]: These machines carry a huge 122 mm cannon that penetrates literally anything they see, including the Ho-Ri. Their shells will go through Ho-Ri's vertical armour of the fighting compartment pretty easily, killing the crew inside or detonating the ammo. To deal with the IS-2, try get a shot at them before the notice you / when they are reloading. These tanks tend to get one-shot due to their lack of crew or the cramped interior. For IS-2 mod.1943, aim for the hull armour that curves and blends into the side, or aim at the turret cheeks. For mod.1944, only go for the turret as the hull is very thick and well sloped. For the ISU-122, aim at anywhere but the gun mantlet, as it often absorb shells or cause ricochet.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good sloping armour on the front
* High velocity high penetrating gun with APHE filler
* Rather good gun depression
* Not slow considering its armour and weight
* Spaced out crew
* Central engine could absorb penetrating front shots

'''Cons:'''

* Armour is not 100% reliable. Fighting compartment can get penetrated by the [[IS-2 (Family)|IS-2]] easily
* It is barely ever going to reach its top speed (40 km/h or 25 mph)
* Side armour is quite bad
* Depressing the gun all the way will open roof for the breech, possibly exposing crew to strafing fire.

== History ==

In September 1942, the Japanese Army Staff received word of the new American M4 Sherman tank, which they realized had completely outclassed every Japanese tank in production at the time. There were three projects proposed by the Staff, each bearing their own gun selection; the 47 mm Kou, 57 mm Otsu, and 75 mm Hei designs. As combat data was filtered to the Japanese High Command, they ordered that the model Kou and Otsu merge to become the basis of what would eventually become the Type 4 Chi-To. Meanwhile, the Hei proposal would lead to the development of the Type 5 Chi-Ri.

Additional development projects came from a change in the Weapons Administration Headquarters Research Policy in July of 1943, a change that was made due to analyzing tank warfare between the German Army and the Soviet Union. Through the analysis of said data, the Japanese Army shifted their tank doctrine towards an emphasis on developing tanks that prioritized anti-armour missions instead of infantry support. Upon the enacting of this policy, the Army started a program to develop a series of tank destroyers based on the chassis of the medium tanks being designed.

The Type 5 Chi-Ri was chosen to become the basis for a new tank destroyer, as it was Japan's primary medium tank project and was more mature than other alternatives, while also mounting some of the most advanced technology Japan had produced at the time.

The tank destroyer would eventually be titled the Ho-Ri. Development of the vehicle began shortly after the Chi-Ri's, and after the decision was made to use the reliable coil spring suspension system that the Japanese manufacturers were familiar with, the Army began work on designing the superstructure and casemate with the first design mimicking the Chi-Ri chassis entirely and replacing the turret with a reinforced rear-mounted superstructure.

During the development of the new tank destroyer series, the Army chose to design a new anti-tank gun to fit the role. In July of 1943, the Army Military Customs Council began designing a 105 mm anti-tank gun based off of the Type 96 150 mm Strategic artillery cannon. It was shortened and given a single piece barrel and tank breech. Unfortunately, the two chief engineers of the cannon project the task that it meet a requirement of penetrating 200 mm at 1,000 m with a 1,000 m/s muzzle velocity. Naturally, the tank gun was not capable of this and instead was only able to penetrate 150 mm at 1,000 m with a 915 m/s muzzle velocity. Although it did not meet the requirements, it was still superior to any other Japanese tank gun and was accepted into service as the Type 5 10cm.

Originally, the Ho-Ri was to keep the hull-mounted Type 1 37 mm from the Chi-Ri due to the idea that the primary cannon could only do so much for itself and a secondary weapon was required. The development of the design was split into to concepts; one being a rear mounted superstructure with a central engine (Ho-Ri I) and the other being a centralized superstructure with a rear engine placement (Ho-Ri II). The engine selection was quite different from the traditional diesel engines that powered most Japanese tanks throughout their production. Instead, Japan had used a V12 gasoline aircraft engine designed by BMW, making 550 horsepower at 1,500 RPM. This engine was chosen due to the industrial capacity of Japan reaching its peak, and many assets from aircraft development were readily available for usage.

However, by the time both designs of the vehicle were proposed, the armour was no longer sufficient to thwart most US anti-tank armaments. Despite this, the design showed considerable promise and it was ordered that a third vehicle be designed with significantly improved armour. This new design was commonly labeled as Ho-Ri III.

The Ho-Ri III took the basis of the Ho-Ri I and revamped it, changing the frontal plate from a flat 75 mm thick plate to a 120 mm thick plate sloped at 70°, deleting the hull-mounted 37 mm gun in the process. Although this was seen as a considerable blow to the tank's self-defense capabilities, it was accepted due to its vastly improved survivability. The removal of the 37 mm gun meant that the extra crew member who previously operated the gun could be used as a second loader to assist with the autoloading mechanism and provide shells for the primary loader.

The construction of the prototype was completed in 1944 and achieved a top speed of 40 km/h during trials. Being seen as a success, the Army ordered 5 units of the vehicle and put it into service as the Type 5 Ho-Ri. However only one operable prototype was fully completed by the war's end and the series only made it to 50% completion, resulting in the design being scrapped and no further testing was pursued.<ref name="Sun Ho-Ri">Sun, Eun Ae.
