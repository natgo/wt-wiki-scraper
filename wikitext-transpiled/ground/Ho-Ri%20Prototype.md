== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/4976-shop-the-new-e-r-a-bundles-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]] and was removed from sale after the [[wt:en/news/6542-shop-the-new-year-sale-en|2019 New Year sale]]. It later returned for purchase in-game with Golden Eagles {{ge}} during the [[wt:en/news/6694-shop-may-sale-in-war-thunder-en|2020 May sale]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear from the rack after having been shot or loaded.
* To go into battle with the flanks empty of ammo, pack 40 (+11) shells or fewer.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ho-Ri can be used in multiple roles. Its most effective at medium range, where it's harder for the enemy to aim for the lower plate and shells have a harder time penetrating the mantlet, making it easy for you to destroy them. Another option, although risky is to sit on a road that players like to go down and use your armour to bounce and take shot and return fire on enemy tanks.

'''Enemies worth noting''':

* [[IS-2]] / [[IS-2 (1944)]] / [[ISU-122]]: These machines carry a huge 122 mm cannon that penetrates literally anything they see, including the Ho-Ri. Their shells will go through Ho-Ri's vertical armour of the fighting compartment pretty easily, killing the crew inside or detonating the ammo. To deal with the IS-2, try get a shot at them before the notice you / when they are reloading. These tanks tend to get one-shot due to their lack of crew or the cramped interior. For IS-2 mod.1943, aim for the hull armour that curves and blends into the side, or aim at the turret cheeks. For mod.1944, only go for the turret as the hull is very thick and well sloped. For the ISU-122, aim at anywhere but the gun mantlet, as it often absorb shells or cause ricochet.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good sloping armour on the front
* High velocity high penetrating gun with APHE filler
* Rather good gun depression
* Not slow considering its armour and weight
* Spaced out crew
* Central engine could absorb penetrating front shots

'''Cons:'''

* Armour is not 100% reliable. Fighting compartment can get penetrated by the [[IS-2 (Family)|IS-2]] easily
* It is barely ever going to reach its top speed (40 km/h or 25 mph)
* Side armour is quite bad
* Depressing the gun all the way will open roof for the breech, possibly exposing crew to strafing fire.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

After the IJA compared Russian and German tanks during 1943 and the shock of encountering the US [[M4]] Sherman, they decided to design tanks with more powerful guns to destroy tanks rather than to support infantry. Like other Japanese self-propelled guns, the Ho-Ri was not equipped any weapon to combat infantry. The design of the Ho-Ri was based on the hull of the Chi-Ri, and with a powerful 105 mm gun mounted in the casemate.

The IJA planned to produce 5 prototypes. However, they made only one 1/5 sized mock-up model

A prototype was completed by August 1944 and five more models were to be completed in 1945, but production was halted due to the industrial damages and resource shortage from the war effort.<ref name="Sun Ho-Ri">Sun, Eun Ae.
