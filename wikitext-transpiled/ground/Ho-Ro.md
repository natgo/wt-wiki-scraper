== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]] along with the rest of the Japanese Ground Forces Tree. The vehicle, known by its full designation as the ''Imperial Japanese Army Type 4 15cm self-propelled gun Ho-Ro'' (Original Text: 日本語: 四式十五糎自走砲 ホロ), is an open-topped SPG with a short-barreled 150 mm howitzer, based on the [[Chi-Ha]] chassis and running gear.

The name "Ho-Ro" translates roughly to ''Gun Two'', or more properly, ''Self Propelled Gun Number 2''.<ref name="FTRecordJapaneseNames">Silentstalker. "Japanese Tank Nomenclature." For the Record. WordPress, 06 Dec. 2013. Web. 15 Jan. 2017. [http://ftr.wot-news.com/2013/12/06/japanese-tank-nomenclature/ Website]</ref>

Since its introduction into War Thunder, the Ho-Ro has gained a reputation for being one of the most powerful howitzer-equipped SPGs in the game despite its low battle-rating, right up there with the beloved [[KV-2 (Family)|KV-2]]. It is capable of destroying or severely disabling any opponent it meets (or more often ambushes), even against top-tier vehicles. This is mainly due to its extremely effective high-explosive shell, however this is balanced by the shell's low velocity, forcing the player to literally lob the shell in an arc at their opponent even for a short distance, and the vehicle's light armour and limited gun traverse compared to other SPGs.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The Ho-Ro is a fairly manoeuvrable SPG, and like many other open-topped vehicles, this is not one that should charge into the front-lines. Just like many of the other low-rank Japanese vehicles, it has no real armour protection from anything more than rifle-calibre MGs, and its ammo storage is literally a box mounted on top of the engine deck. The crew is very exposed, and the gun breech is mounted rather high on the chassis and can be easily knocked out. With this knowledge in mind, the Ho-Ro is best played by staying in the rear (but not distantly) of friendly tanks as short-range or point-blank artillery fire, along with finding hidden positions where it can attempt to be hull-down out of sight of the enemy.

Due to its low-velocity shell, the gun often needs to be aimed higher than the commander estimates when performing direct-fire onto a target, but this also allows the vehicle to lob shells from behind shallow hills, out of the sight from opponents that may be camping or pushing into friendly territory on the other side. However, because its HE shell is so powerful, it is extremely risky to fire directly next to or very close to an enemy vehicle, as the light armour may not protect the crew, and the blast from the explosion it will certainly deal damage to the vehicle itself. The gun, while powerful, cannot traverse very far to either side, so in order to fire on tanks that are outside of the arc of the gun's horizontal traverse, the entire hull must be traversed as well. The recoil of the gun is also an issue, as it throws the vehicle backwards rather severely, which means it loses target acquisition every time it fires.

One interesting note is the pintle-mounted MG on the roof, which has good elevation and a much wider range of horizontal fire than the main gun, which can be useful on spotting enemy tanks for team-mates or dealing with [[:Category:Anti-aircraft_vehicles|SPAA]]s that have exposed crew members. However, it has a slower rate of fire than most other rifle-calibre MGs and its magazine capacity is pitiful. In conclusion, the Ho-Ro is a very defensive vehicle suited to supporting friendly tanks and ambushing the enemy on paths where they may attempt to flank around the map.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 150 mm howitzer makes it an intimidating foe
* Howitzer's round trajectory makes it able to fire over hills
* Large TNT filler in its HE shell
* HE load can cause sufficient splash and shrapnel damage even if the shell doesn't directly hit the target
* Can destroy most, if not all, vehicles by shooting HE just under an enemy tank and hitting the thin belly armour
* Can deter inattentive flak trucks or any vehicles with open and exposed crew with its roof-mounted MG
* Quick, manoeuvrable in both AB and RB, though slightly sluggish to put into gear in the latter
* Good gun depression
* HE Shell will destroy any vehicle you come up against

'''Cons:'''

* Super thin armour, extremely vulnerable to heavy machine guns, SPAAs, and aircraft
* Extreme blast radius can destroy the vehicle if fired too close to oneself
* Ammo Rack is literally a box behind the crew on top of the engine deck, leading to some very explosive ends if hit there
* Massive recoil causes the vehicle to be launched backwards after firing, requiring aiming adjustment after every shot
* Horizontal traverse is disappointing
* Very slow muzzle velocity and limited range
* At long range, the shells have a habit of bouncing harmlessly off armour surfaces without exploding
* AP Shell lacking in penetration for the calibre relies more on HE power

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Type 4 Ho-Ro was a Self Propelled Gun developed by the Imperial Japanese Army based off of the German Grille series. It was developed off the Type 97 Chi-Ha chassis and used a 150 mm Kruppe gun, considered outdated by 1942. It was used to combat American forces. Only few were made, and out of those few 8 were sunk with a Japanese ship somewhere in the Pacific. Usually deployed in groups of 4, it was used in the Philippines during late 1944 and then used in ones and twos on Okinawa, with a somewhat great affect. It was ineffective due to its 3 degrees of gun swing and 30 degrees of depression because of the gun mounts design. That gave it a small firing distance of 6,000 m. It also could only fire 5 shells per minute because of the breechloader.
