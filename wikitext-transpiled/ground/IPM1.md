== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', or just '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''', is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 "The Valkyries"]].

The IPM1 (Improved Performance M1) is a minor upgrade upon the protection of the [[M1 Abrams]]. This is primarily confined to improved composite protection in the turret cheeks, resulting in a slightly lengthened turret. The IPM1 maintains the same engine, weapon and other internals of the M1.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The IPM1 maintains the protective measures and survivability of the original M1 Abrams, with the exception of a minor increase in the levels of composite protection. The result is a notable improvement in chemical protection and a minor improvement in kinetic protection. As with its predecessor, the turret cheeks and UFP are quite effective at deflecting ATGMs and HEAT rounds with only a few exceptions (such as the ADATS' 900 mm penetration missiles). Despite the improved protection, the IPM1 is still vulnerable to turret ring, gun mantlet and lower front plate shots, and particularly powerful kinetic rounds through the turret cheeks.

The Abrams' survivability comes not from armour, but rather from the spread-out crew members and critical components, and blowout panel protecting the crew from ammunition detonation. Often this results in enemies needing to make the choice of either disabling the vehicle's mobility ''or'' its offensive ability with their initial round; allowing the Abrams either to escape further damage or fire back.

Rounds that penetrate the rear panel between the turret crew compartment and blowout compartment will negate the blowout protection, causing any potential ammunition detonation to knock the vehicle's crew out as well.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=2,058|rbMinHp=1,343}}

The {{PAGENAME}} retains the same engine as the original M1 Abrams with a minor increase (+0.9t) in weight due to the armour improvements. As such, the {{PAGENAME}} suffers from a minimal reduction in top speed but will still comfortably reach 70km/h on-road. Despite the hugely powerful engine, the vehicle's manoeuvrability suffers prior to the Tracks upgrade being researched; once Tracks have been purchased the IPM1 will perform significantly better in close quarters or in off-road applications.

As with the original Abrams, the {{PAGENAME}} largely relies on its powerful engine to get it to the battlefield earlier than other vehicles and into advantageous positions.

{{main|M68A1 (105 mm)}}

Like its predecessor, the IPM1 is equipped with a reliable 105 mm M68A1 cannon, and also has access to the same ammunition. The 105 mm cannon is somewhat sub-par relative to the weaponry other top rank vehicles are equipped with, but an experienced tanker can make use of the decent round ballistics and incredibly good reload speeds to quickly despatch targets. It's important to know what the cannon is capable of and where weak spots are on enemy vehicles, particularly when facing more modern vehicles such as the Leopard 2A5 and T-80U.

{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|M240 (7.62 mm)}}

The IPM1 is equipped with no less than three machine guns - while most often these are only valuable for clearing obstacles or tagging enemy vehicles, on occasion they might prove valuable dealing with close air support or nearby helicopters, as well as some light vehicles.

Additionally, due to the barrage of rounds produced when all three machine guns are fired simultaneously, they can sometimes be used to obstruct an enemy vehicle's gun sight simply by shooting their main gun (AB/RB) or their optics (SB)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The IPM1 should primarily rely on its speed and reload time to quickly despatch enemies and move back into cover. Where possible, make flanking manoeuvres or use the Abrams' mobility to get into forward positions with the intention to catch unsuspecting targets off. Be aware, however, that the Abrams is only marginally faster than vehicles like the Leopard 2K and T-80U.

When forced into open or ranged engagements, use cover to protect your hull; while the turret may provide insufficient protection keeping the hull safe will often allow you to move back into cover if hit or damaged and repair or relocate, rather than losing your mobility and ability to escape.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Composite armour in turret cheeks and UFP are capable of stopping all but the most powerful chemical rounds and ATGMs
- Has a very fast reload, 6.5 seconds stock down to 5.0 seconds aced
- Very powerful engine, high top speed and good acceleration characteristics
- Extremely good reverse speed
- Fast turret traverse
- Extremely fast gun elevation/depression
- Well spread crew and critical components result in good survivability
- Blowout compartment can save crew from some ammunition detonation cases
- Array of machine guns, effective against CAS, nearby helicopters and some light vehicles

'''Cons:'''

- Armour provides suboptimal kinetic protection
- The 105 mm APFSDS rounds aren't particularly powerful; may struggle to penetrate some modern targets
- Extra armour reduces top speed and acceleration
- Extremely vulnerable gun mantlet and turret ring
- Turbine engine is extremely loud, often audible from long distance and can be used to discern the direction of the vehicle
- Has the slowest reverse speed of (36km/h RB) out of all Abrams with (41km/h RB).
- Like with most Abrams series tanks, the engine deck is slightly raised, meaning that you will not be able to depress the gun over the rear of the tank.

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

;Development M1
{{main|M1 Abrams#History|l1=History of the M1 Abrams}}
With the cancellation of the MBT-70/XM-803 program in 1971, a new program to research and create prototypes for a main battle tank was created in 1972 known as the Main Battle Tank Task Force (MBTTF) at Fort Knox. General Motors and Chrysler were eventually selected to submit drafts and designs and by the end of 1973 there were scale mock-ups of the XM1 prototypes. The design was featured around the previously used 105 mm M68 gun along with a high powered engine for increased mobility.<ref name="Hunnicut1" /> It was decided to explore new types of composite armour, and the Chobham armour being developing in Britain at the time was examined although it was not used in the XM1 prototypes.<ref name="Hunnicut2" /> The XM1 was tested in 1976, and by the end of the year Chrysler was chosen to create extensive engineering test vehicles.<ref name="Hunnicut3" />

Testing of the Full Scale Engineering Development (FSED) prototypes took place in 1978 and 1979 with 11 vehicles being produced. By this time the Honeywell AGT-1500 gas turbine engine was installed. After successful modifications and testing, initial production was approved in 1979 for a series of 110 units.<ref name="Hunnicut4" /> Following more testing and finalization, production of the standardized '''105 mm Gun Tank, M1''' Abrams was approved in 1981, with the production run lasting until January 1985 and over 2,300 vehicles being made.<ref name="Hunnicut5" />

;Development IPM1

The '''105 mm Gun Tank M1, Improved Performance''' was a modification of the original M1 Abrams tank that was produced between October 1984 through May 1986 with a total of 894 vehicles being produced. The changes made to create the Improved Performance models were taken from the ongoing Block I development program for the M1 Abrams, which would eventually produce the M1A1. Additional NERA armour protection in the turret was added, an upgraded suspension and changes to the transmission gears all added substantial weight and the maximum speed was reduced from 45 to 41.5 mph (72.4 to 67.8 km/h). In addition, more stowage racks were added to the turret, which was elongated to fit the additional composite armour arrays.<ref name="Hunnicut6" />
