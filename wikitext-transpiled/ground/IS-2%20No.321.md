== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Wind of Change"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7676-event-legend-of-victory-is-2-321-en|Legend of Victory]] event.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 122 mm gun with enough explosive filler to knock out a tank with a single penetrating shot.
* Large calibre gives round good overmatching mechanics against most front armour of medium tanks.
* Upper hull plate is thickly armoured and angled, able to resist most shells with the exception of HEAT or APDS.
* Relatively good mobility and top speed for a heavy tank, with a faster reverse speed as well to withdraw quickly.
* Roof mounted machine gun can help defend against lightly-armoured vehicles or low-flying aircraft. 

'''Cons:'''

* Long reload speed makes follow-up shots slow
* Has front armour weak points in the turret and lower glacis.
* Hull armour construction makes angling difficult due to weaker hull sides and cheeks
* Cramped interior compartment can likely knock out entire crew or ignite ammunition in a single shot.
* Poor -3 degree depression prohibits the usage of many hull-down fighting positions
* No add-on spaced armour compared to the original [[IS-2 (1944)]].
