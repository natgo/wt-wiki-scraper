== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 "Assault"]]. This is one of the most dreaded tanks of its BR spread since it features a good cannon and awesome mobility packed inside a heavily sloped thick armour that most APHE shells cannot penetrate. Use this tank in any role and situation, it will surely find its place on the battlefield. Having very good mobility and a respectable reverse speed allows the IS-6 to plow through sticky situations that many other tanks would struggle with.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
100 mm sloped at more or less 60­° on all sides provide this vehicle with a reputation to be a ''ricochet master''. Firing on the hull from almost any angle will only result in a glancing shot. The only weak spot being the lower sides of the hull and turret sides and rear, the only way to reliably penetrate it is to get a shot from the side. An attentive player that never shows the sides is an invincible opponent. However, be aware of the frontal armour, as the extremely angled turret armour encasing the cannon breech can create a shot trap and ricochet the shell into the driver's area. This will likely result in your ammo exploding. Be wary when facing any opponent.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof, cupola roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret, cupola)

'''Notes:'''

*Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick while tracks are 30 mm thick. Torsion bar connectors by the wheels are 60 mm thick.
*Spaced armour plates are placed on the sides, giving an additional 10 mm of side armour.

From the front, only high-end rounds (HEATFS, HESH, APFSDS) can penetrate the IS-6. Otherwise, flank it since its lower side armour is flat behind the tracks. In a close to medium range fight, if the IS-6 is static and facing you, try to shoot its right side turret cupola, a penetrating APHE shell may knock out the commander and gunner, disabling the tank (some large calibre rounds can even knock out the loader and/or driver, resulting in an instant elimination). This strategy is not applicable with rounds that don't have HE filler.

Another weak spot is the left side of the mantlet which has the optics in it. This part of the armour is thin enough that most shells at the BR can penetrate it, and in doing do, incapacitate the commander and gunner and destroy the cannon breech. If you are lucky and the IS-6 has ammo in the back of its turret, there is a chance to detonate it as well for an instant elimination.

If you happen to flank an IS-6, take the time to aim since half of its side is covered by its dreaded armour. A missed shot will alert the IS-6 player, withdrawing with its fast speed from sight before another shot could be landed. Turret sides and back can ricochet rounds as well, so keep the hull as a priority target.

If encountering this foe from its back, keep in mind to aim for the middle of the engine deck since plates on both sides are as though as their frontal counterparts. If confident, go for it and aim at the turret back.

Any round penetrating the crew compartment leads to an ammo rack detonation most of the time since this tank's interior is filled with ammo all over the place.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=904|rbMinHp=619}}

If used well, the {{PAGENAME}} can get into position as fast as a T-54. It is certainly one of the fastest late IS-series tanks. It reaches 44.3 km/h (27.5 mph), the top speed in RB, with ease and has a reverse speed of -16.1 km/h (10 mph).

{{main|D-30T (122 mm)}}

The IS-6 features an upgraded version of the [[D-25T (122 mm)|D-25T]] gun found on other IS series variants, the D-30T. Though identical ballistically, it provides a much faster reload, with the IS-6 having a default reload rate only 0.5 seconds longer than the [[T-10M]]. The IS-6 uses the same ammo load as the [[IS-2]] with the best shell being the BR-471B, which means the tank will have trouble against some heavies it may encounter from lacking penetration. In addition, the IS-6 does not have access to the BR-471D, which is usable on the IS-3.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The IS-6 brings about improved mobility characteristics compared to the [[IS-3]] in the tech tree, yet retains similar armour characteristics and firepower (though it lacks the higher-penetrating BR-471D shell). This mobility improvement should not be taken lightly as it allows the IS-6 to react faster to new threats, whether it be an offensive push, a repositioning, or a short withdrawal.

The role the IS-6 excels at is as a breakthrough vehicle. The IS-6 should take front stage when it comes to assaulting an objective. Its speed and armour can allow the heavy tank to take on enemy fire while on the move as most AP rounds will struggle to penetrate the IS-6 when its armour remains sloped towards the enemy. Make the enemies focus on the IS-6 so teammates can move up and engage the enemies from different angles. Once the enemy focuses on the teammates, move up and assist in taking out the enemy with the IS-6's 122 mm gun.

Firepower is rather lacklustre with the maximum 205 mm penetration at point-blank range, meaning most shots with the IS-6 needs to be carefully aimed towards the enemy's weak points. Combined with the lengthy reload, the first shot the IS-6 takes on an enemy is essential as it may determine the outcome of the engagement. These limiting factors mean that the ideal fighting range for the IS-6 is around 500 metres, as this allows the IS-6 to make the most of the 122 mm gun's penetration and velocity while staying far enough away that the enemy could not quickly rush the IS-6 while it is reloading. Although the reloading weakness can be mitigated by having an escape plan ready so to use the IS-6's mobility to make a tactical retreat.

These features make the IS-6 a somewhat good defender as well, taking the role after assaulting an objective. Making use of cover in a capture area, the IS-6 can lock down chokepoints and focus its 122 mm gun down the range, using its mobility to quickly withdraw after a shot. As the IS-6 would be watching in a more stationary role, the gun handling would be more stable so to be able to make longer-ranged shots against enemies attempting to (re)capture the point. Do keep in mind the bad gun depression of only -3°, so the IS-6 is likely to have a good part of its armour exposed when attempting to face the enemy from a defensive position. As stated above, ensure a good escape strategy is formulated so that a bad 122 mm shot doesn't result in the enemy swarming the IS-6.

Facing enemies with HEATFS rounds is a dire situation for the IS-6 as the armour is not thick enough to withstand the round in any angle. Extreme caution should be taken when fighting those tanks. It would be more ideal to withdraw into a different firing position and either wait to ambush the enemy tank as it comes to pursue the IS-6 or provide teammates the opportunity to take out the enemy.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Reload rate considerably faster than usual 122 mm, default is only half a second slower than the T-10M
* The best 122 mm shell available is still manageable due to good overmatching mechanics and tremendous post-penetration damage potential
** Frontal armour is a 100 mm plate sloped at a very steep angle, making it mostly immune to anything that isn't APDS or HEATFS
* Like the IS-3, the lower plate isn't a weak spot
* Very good as side-scraping due to the high levels of side armour
* The turret is both small, well-armoured, and rounded
* The weak spot on the turret front is smaller than the Tiger II's, hitting it at ranges exceeding 500 m is very difficult
* Very low profile for a heavy, meaning it can hide in places that the Tiger II simply can't
* Is very fast and manoeuvrable for a heavy tank
* Due to the armour, fire rate, and reverse speed, the IS-6 is very good at shoot-and-scoot tactics as well as brawling
* Has a 12.7 mm pintle-mounted heavy machine gun on the roof
* Premium vehicle bonuses
* Due to the top speed, high levels of armour, and firepower, the IS-6 is a more versatile tank than the IS-3

'''Cons:'''

* Can't take the top 122mm shell that the IS-3 can, leaving the IS-6 unable to compete against tanks like the Jagdtiger, M103, and Maus from the front
* Enemies firing HEAT and APDS are common and can penetrate the IS-6's armour with ease
* The IS-6 is still very capable of getting the turret front penetrated by tanks like the Tiger II, T29, and Centurion Mk 3
* Like most Russian heavies, has an abysmal 3 degrees of gun depression, so finding the proper hull down locations is hard
* The 4-man crew is crammed in a small crew compartment that's full of ammo, and penetrating APHE shell will likely incapacitate the entire turret crew or set off an ammo explosion

The Chelyabinsk Kirov Plant Work (ChKZ) began drafting the designs of a new heavy tank on 02 May 1944<ref name="TankArchivesElectric" /> with an electrotransmission, a drive system that was used on the German [[Ferdinand|Ferdinand/Elefant]]. The plant was officially ordered to begin work on June 08<ref name="KinnearT10" /> for two versions of the heavy tank, with emphasis of having significant advantages over the current [[IS-2 (1944)|IS-2 heavy tank]]. The heavy tank was designated as the '''IS-6''' and the two versions were the ''Object 252'' with a mechanical transmission and the ''Object 253'' with a electric transmission.<ref name="TankArchivesLaunch" /> Both prototypes were produced in the Fall of 1944 and were sent to be tested at the NIIBT testing grounds at Kubinka.

The two prototypes differed in more ways than just the transmission. Object 252 used the mechanical transmission from the [[IS-3]], with large road wheels and no track rollers for its torsion bar suspension.<ref name="BoldyrevTank" /> Object 253 used an electric transmission with a suspension that looked similarly to previous IS iterations with smaller road wheels and track rollers. The IS-6 prototypes failed to stay under the weight of the IS-2, being around 51.5 tons.<ref name="TankArchives257" /> The 122 mm gun arming the IS-6 was the D-30, compared to the D-25T on the predecessors. The D-30 implemented features such as the D-25's monobloc design, the 100 mm D-10's breech and gas block, a two-spring balancing mechanism, a lengthened D-25 mount, and a fume extractor. This gun was installed onto the IS-6 prototypes in December 1944.<ref name="TankArchivesD-30" />

The IS-6 prototypes were tested alongside the ''Object 701'' (the prototype of the [[IS-4M|IS-4]]).<ref name="TankArchives257" /> The two IS-6 prototypes proved disappointing, with the Object 253's electric transmission being too complex, expensive, and unreliable.<ref name="KinnearT10" /> The Object 252's mechanical transmission also suffered from reliability issues. Suspension problems also impacted the IS-6, with its speed dropping below the heavier Object 701. It was hoped that the electric transmission would help make the tank more manoeuvrable, but the heavy weight prohibited any vast improvements.<ref name="BoldyrevTank" /> Overall, the IS-6 armour was deemed to not provide any improvements over existing designs, having only comparable armour, firepower, and mobility to the IS-2 and IS-3. In 1945, all work on the IS-6 ceased as work continued on the Object 701.<ref name="TankArchives257" />
