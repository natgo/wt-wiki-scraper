== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In the early years of the Cold War, the Swedish Army envisioned a new set of armoured fighting vehicles capable of supporting the infantry. Serving as a replacement to the towed artillery pieces, the vehicle had to be produced in large numbers, yet mobile enough to manoeuvre with the infantry and fulfill their support needs. The result was a very small self-propelled gun designated the "Infanterikanonvagn" ("Ikv", or the ''Infantry Cannon Carrier''). The first version adopted was the Ikv 72, armed with a 75 mm gun. 36 units would be produced and would see service until the late 1950s, when it started to be replaced by the [[Ikv 103|Ikv 102]].

Introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]], the Ikv 72 is an excellent as a light tank destroyer, the good mobility allows usage in "hit and run" tactics, flanking the main force of the enemy team that will usually be made of tanks slower than the Ikv 72. The low velocity of the projectiles (580 m/s) and mid-penetration capabilities makes it harder to use as a sniper like most tank destroyers. Users should be aware of artillery fire, aircraft and autocannons/HMGs, as these can destroy the Ikv 72 with ease due to lack of armour and no roof in the vehicle to protect the crew.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
With a maximum frontal armour thickness of 18.5 mm, the Ikv 72 has nearly no armour to speak of. The side armour is almost negligible, and can be penetrated by even rifle-calibre machine guns at point blank ranges. Aircraft are particularly deadly, as the vehicle has an open-topped crew compartment, and what little roof armour there is is only 5 mm thick at most.

The crew compartment is very cramped, and any hit by a large shell is liable to disable multiple crew members, if not all of them, simultaneously.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The Ikv 72 trades armour for mobility, boasting an excellent power/weight ratio and a high top speed of around 60 km/h. This allows it to easily get to good positions where it can put its powerful gun to best use. A high reverse speed also allows it to easily back off, and is particularly valuable when fighting in hull-down positions, where it can use its excellent gun depression to its advantage.

{{main|kan m/41 (75 mm)}}

The Ikv 72 is armed with the '''7,5 cm kan m/41''', a rather conventional quick-firing 75 mm field gun. It starts off with the unremarkable '''slpprj m/40''' uncapped AP shot, which is adequate against most opposition it may encounter but tends to suffer ricochets against sloped armour. However, once upgraded, the gun may fire the '''slpgr m/39''' uncapped APHE shell and the '''slpprj m/40B''' APBC shot. The former round has a very lethal 260 g TNT filler but tends to ricochet more and has less penetration, while the latter has better penetration and ricochets less, and is thus more useful in uptiers. It is recommended to carry a mixture of both APHE and APBC unless the Ikv 72 is top tier, in which case the APHE alone is sufficient.

The gun also has an outstanding ±20° of gun elevation, allowing the Ikv 72 to take advantage of hull down positions that most other tanks cannot.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The Ikv 72 is a relatively light armoured tank destroyer which had a purpose of supporting the infantry during attack charges and taking out enemy positions and light targets. Ikv 72 has relatively high speed and mobility making it able to quickly get to points and positions like a light tank and ambush enemies with, it has great penetration capability with its stock round and will unlock another great round, the slpprj m/40B, as a tier 4 modification. Armed with a 75 mm [[Kan m/41 (75 mm)|Kan m/41]], the Ikv 72 has great firepower for a low tier tank destroyer with also a decent amount of 42 rounds it can bring into battle compared to the [[SU-5-1]] which can only bring 8 rounds.

The Ikv 72 excels at fighting from hull down positions, using its outstanding 20 degrees of gun depression, low silhouette, and high reverse speed to limit exposure when taking shots. The high reverse speed also helps in city fighting when it has to quickly retreat after taking a shot. It is fast enough to keep up with even light tanks and can use this to take up unexpected positions from which to strike at the enemy making it an excellent ambush tank, both in hilly terrain and city fighting.

The negative things with Ikv 72 is the compact crew compartment makes it easy for shells to easily knock it out, and being open top exposing it to machine gun fire from enemy aircraft and tanks. Also the weak armour makes it easy for any tanks and heavy machine gun to penetrate with ease, hence it's advised to go for ambush tactics, where the Ikv 72 can get the first shot on the enemy. One other negative thing with the Ikv 72 is the low velocity on the shells, making it harder for it to take up a "sniper" position to be efficient which makes the Ikv 72 more adapt at close to medium range combat, so try to find a good postion that is not too far away for intended target.

Things to be aware of in the Ikv 72 are mostly tanks or trucks with heavy machine guns or autocannons like [[Pz.II C]], [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]], [[T17E2]] and [[Ta-Se]], which will tear the Ikv 72 apart with ease in direct confrontation with it. Hence trying to keep as low attention as possible on the Ikv 72 will be to its advantage where it can without being fired at take shots on enemy tanks from its position.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Outstanding gun depression (-20°)
* Relatively fast rate-of-fire
* Excellent forward and reverse speeds
* Highly effective APHE shell with a large explosive filler
* Small target size, especially at long range
* Ammo is stored very safely, will get only ammoracked by artillery or by direct hits

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely vulnerable to air attacks and artillery strikes
* Nearly no armour to speak of
* Must choose between high penetration APBC or high damage APHE
* Cramped crew compartment
* Commander and Loader are exposed with their heads being above the armour plate
* Low shell velocities inhibit use as a sniper

== History ==

The Infanterikanonvagn 72 was a project started in 1949 by Sweden for an assault gun. The intended role of this vehicle was to support the infantry in the attack, replacing towed artillery guns. The design was to be small, and of light weight, around 6 tons. This was to reduce costs so a larger amount could be produced. The first prototype from Landsverk, completed in 1950, was armed only with three machine guns. This was insufficient, and it was re-armed with a 75 mm cannon, the same gun from the Strv m/42. It was a small, lightly armoured vehicle, with a casemate superstructure housing the 75 mm gun. It had a crew of 4, and it was open topped. The Ikv 72 was later upgraded to the Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 standards, receiving an armoured roof for the crew compartment, a 105 mm gun, and other improvements. The design weighed about 8 tons.
