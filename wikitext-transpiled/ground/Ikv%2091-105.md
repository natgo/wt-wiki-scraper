== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

== General info ==
[[File:Ikv 91-105 Profile Image.png|left|thumb|300px|{{PAGENAME}} as seen from the side.]]
The {{PAGENAME}} is a Swedish light tank that offers accurate firepower with good mobility. The gun fires highly devastating APFSDS rounds that can effectively deal with targets opposing it around flanking routes and open fields. The tank relies heavily on shooting first, as the vehicle features little protection to save it. This requires the user to creatively position the vehicle so enemies are ensured to be shot first, to avoid any possible incoming damage. The gun is well equipped with a two-plane stabilizer and laser rangefinder, which guarantees a perfect shot at any range when used properly. As a secondary line of defence, the {{PAGENAME}} features a good amount of smoke grenades that quickly deploy high above the tank, allowing it to very effectively escape either by reversing or swiftly turning around.

Overall, the {{PAGENAME}} is a great tank for anyone already used to the [[Ikv 91]] looking for a modernized alternative, as well as for anyone interested in a conventional light tank at this high rank.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} is a light vehicle. In order to remain agile, the {{PAGENAME}} is forced to sacrifice most of its protection. The hull and turret sport a different shape compared to the earlier [[Ikv 91]], but overall maintain the same level of protection. The upper and lower plates can occasionally protect against .50 cal MG fire, but the turret is often left exposed. The {{PAGENAME}} should always avoid incoming fire from large-calibre machine guns and cannons, as they are more than likely guaranteed to damage the tank internally.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* High-hardness rolled homogeneous armour (hull sides, lower front plate)

'''Notes:'''

* Tracks are 15 mm thick, while suspension wheels and torsion bars are 20 mm thick.
* Belly armour is 10 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
[[File:Ikv 91-105 Mobility Image.png|thumb|250px|{{PAGENAME}} moving through tall grass]]

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=558|rbMinHp=318}}

Although the mobility of the {{PAGENAME}} can come off as mediocre, the overall agility of the vehicle is very comfortable in battle. The tank is able to neutral steer without any issue, and has enough speed in both directions to avoid most situations. The engine is essentially identical to the prior [[Ikv 91]], and thus struggles a lot when difficult slopes are encountered, considering the tank is significantly heavier than its original variant.

[[File:Ikv 91-105 Firing Image.png|thumb|{{PAGENAME}} firing the main 105 mm cannon.]]
The 105 mm cannon found on the {{PAGENAME}} is a two-plane stabilized gun, capable of firing sub-calibre munitions, such as the Slpprj m/80, that perform favourably against most vehicles it faces. Although the penetration might seem like a downgrade compared to the HEATFS found on the prior [[Ikv 91]], the shells fired have a much higher velocity, and devastating penetration values at high angles.

The cannon is paired with a laser rangefinder, which automatically adjusts the elevation at range. This makes the {{PAGENAME}} very capable at distanced engagements, as the gun can fire with perfect accuracy as soon as the target has been measured. The user still has to account for target movement, as well as objects or terrain obstructing the target. But when used carefully, the gun only really requires a single shot per target.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 3 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 11 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 1 - 2.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-2 into rack 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|ksp m/39B (8 mm)}}

The {{PAGENAME}} features two 8 mm machine guns. These are quite common for most Swedish tankers, and are only effective against exposed crew, and slow flying helicopters. The 8 mm rounds are quite effective at dealing with light obstacles like small fences and foliage, but should always be used with caution, as the tracers can expose the location of the vehicle.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

When playing the {{PAGENAME}}, it's important to play like a light tank. The {{PAGENAME}}, although nimble, can be quite slow when stock. Overall the tank struggles to maintain a high speed, and will often lag behind other vehicles of the same class. The great compensation for this is the firepower. Thanks to a deadly arsenal of shells, along with a stabilizer, the tank engages any vehicle it faces with ease. Paired with a stabilizer and laser rangefinder, the {{PAGENAME}} can comfortably attack at any distance. This makes the {{PAGENAME}} very flexible, as you can use it both as a long range reconnaissance sniper, and a close range glass cannon.

When a match starts, it's always optimal to look for a favourable location within reach. If mobility allows you to surprise your opponents, it can be a favourable choice, especially in close quarter maps. While other situations could call for distanced engagements, such as unexpected sight-lines and well hidden ambushes, as the tank is fairly easy to hide. On top of its small profile, the {{PAGENAME}} features a good amount of smoke launchers, that quickly deploy and conceal the vehicle when necessary.

A typical engagement scenario:

# Rush to a position with a favourable line of sight
# Engage opponents without exposing yourself
# Scout targets for your team
# Deploy smoke grenades to help your team retreat

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Hard-hitting 105 mm cannon
* Small profile, shorter than most tanks
* Great mobility and traverse
* Ability to scout and repair
* Access to night vision devices

'''Cons:'''

* Lightly armoured, insufficient even to resist .50 cal MG fire
* Mediocre rate of fire
* Inconsistent depression angles, uncomfortable to aim behind cover
* Vulnerable to aircraft

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
AB Hägglunds & Söner, the company behind the Ikv 91 light tank, had high hopes for a successful export market, outside the domestic use of the platform. The design had been ill-fated early since the chassis was too weak to handle high-pressure weaponry, necessary for sub-calibre munitions. By the 1980s however, the ability to mount a high pressure 105 mm cannon was taken to consideration, as Bofors had developed a low-recoil variant. This design idea quickly took shape in 1983 as India was looking for a new amphibious light tank. The requirements involved full firing capability when submerged, meaning the cannon had to be stabilized. The vehicle introduced a commanders fire control system, as well as Infra-red night vision devices provided by SAAB. India evaluated the design, along with other countries, but ultimately no series production was ever established. The Swedish Army considered a possible modernization of the Ikv 91 by using this 105 mm gun, but found the design too weak for such high weaponry.
