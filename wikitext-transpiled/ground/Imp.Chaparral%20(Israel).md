<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

*

'''Cons:'''

* 4 exposed crew with only one protected crew inside the turret, susceptible to even 7.62mm machine gun fire which can lead to a crew knockout
* Open top vehicle, very vulnerable to overpressure from HE shells, rockets, artillery strikes, and bombs.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The United States Army developed the M48 Chaparral in the 1960s as a short-range surface-to-air missile system which would complement the [[M163|M163 Vulcan]]. The system used the MIM-72 Chaparral missile - a unique adaptation of the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder (Family)|AIM-9 Sidewinder]] air-to-air missile which had been entering service in the US Air Force at the time. The Chaparral launch vehicle carried four such missiles on a rotating turret on top of an [[M113 (Family)|M113]] hull, with an enlarged "cabin" at the front containing the fire control system. The unique turret was designed for fast 360-degree rotation as well as a maximum elevation of 90 degrees, allowing the system to engage enemy aircraft quickly and easily.

In 1973, Egypt and Syria performed a surprise attack on Israel (known as the Yom Kippur War) using masses of advanced Soviet weaponry supplied to them in the years since the 1967 Six-Day War. Aerial attacks by MiGs and Soviet helicopters in particular proved very difficult to stop with Israel's small air force and aging short-range AA weaponry. Richard Nixon's administration, fearing a demonstration of Soviet superiority in the Middle East, decided to supply Israel with an aerial train full of American-made weapons, combat vehicles and munitions. As part of one such shipment, Israel received its first two M48 Chaparrals as well as urgent training for a handful of crews.

The two vehicles arrived almost at the very end of the war. Reports indicate that they were made ready just in time to be deployed in the Sinai peninsula, assisting an MIM-23 Hawk battery in hunting for Egyptian helicopters on the eastern side of the Suez Canal in the days immediately following the war. Though the Hawks shot down many enemy helicopters, no Chaparral kills were reported during that particular operation. A much larger number of Chaparrals were purchased, with the first battery becoming operational only a few weeks after the Yom Kippur War. The Chaparral made its first and only kill in world history in 1974, when an Israeli operator shot down a low-flying Syrian [[MiG-17]] attacking Israeli ground forces in the Golan Heights.

In the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), the Chaparral received the codename ''Drakon'' (Dragon), though they kept the purchase a secret for several years after its introduction. The Israeli Air Defense Array was apparently impressed by the vehicle's performance, as it continued to purchase various M48 Chaparral models for the next 25 years, in large quantities. The last purchase was completed in 1999, when Israel received at least several dozen M48 "Improved Chaparral" vehicles from US Army surplus. Reportedly, these systems all came from "block 6" of production, likely equipped with MIM-72G missiles. Though the launch vehicles were essentially identical to the original M113s used in early M48s, the Improved Chaparral's missiles featured several advancements to match the developing lethality of the Sidewinder over the years: all-aspect targeting, a heavier fragmentation-type warhead, a better guidance and tracking system, and an improved ability to ignore enemy countermeasures.

These new Chaparral vehicles would only serve in the IDF for another 4 years after their introduction, after which the entire Chaparral array was finally retired from service in 2003. Today, The IDF relies exclusively on Stinger MANPADS (infantry-operated) for short-range surface-to-air interception.
