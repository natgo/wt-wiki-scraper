== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Red Skies"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The tank gets almost no armour, so you are best off hiding or staying at your teams spawn and being an SPAA. Even light machine guns can kill you.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Vents)
* Bulletproof glass (Windows)
* Wheel (tires, suspension bars)

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Long range of 12 km
* VT1 missiles come stock and they are very fast
* Has access to gen 3 gunner thermals
* Can fire all 8 missiles without reloading

'''Cons:'''

* 8 mm of all-around armour is insufficient to stop even .50 cal machine guns
* Search radar when unfolded sticks out quite far giving it a very tall profile
* Lacks any sort of self-defence against ground targets
* Lacks any sort of mobility offroad or uphill

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The ItO 90M is based on the Sisu XA-180 platform and uses the French surface-to-air missile systen called CrotaleNG MOD.<ref>[[wikipedia:Crotale_(missile)|[Wikipedia] Crotale (missile)]]</ref> 

In 1980, Sisu produced an XA-180 prototype for testing. It competed against two other prototypes, but was the winner of the trials in 1983. in December 1983, the Finnish Army ordered a first batch of 50 XA-180s, of which 9 were reserved for UN. The vehicle proved itself successful and more were ordered by the army.<ref>[[wikipedia:Patria_Pasi|[Wikipedia] Patria Pasi]]</ref>
