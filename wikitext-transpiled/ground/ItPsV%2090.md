== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The vehicle's survivability is rather odd, because the Hull can be durable due to it being the hull of a 2A4, but the turret is extremely weak.

Frontally, one can get lucky and bounce some shots from the hull being barely scratched, but should not expect miracles, the Leopards always relied to their turret in armour, somewhat neglecting the hull. Hits to sides will also penetrate its armour with most guns, including autocannons although the fuel tanks and tracks might absorb those if lucky, but one should be weary.

The oddity begins especially when begins the talk about the elephant in the room, the Marksman turret. It can block heavy MG fire and that's it. Any hit to the turret will very likely lead to the vehicle's demise, due to it not only housing 2/3 of your crew, but the ammo reserves too. That also makes the driver it's only somewhat protected crewmember, he sits at front left (when looking at the tank straight on) behind a composite screen of armour and has some composite slats added to the sides of the tank's front to cover him. 

The vehicle can survive unscathed if it gets shot from the side below the turret, because there is just empty space there, but that's not really a good trait, more so a case of getting lucky with the enemy having a bad shot.

Shots to the rear will always immobilize the vehicle, since the whole engine and transmission are there, coupled with fuel tanks in front which will likely result in the need to use FPE before starting repairs.

Generally, one should try their best to remain unseen by enemy armour, the guns might be able to dish out damage, but the vehicle can barely take any. Planes will also prove deadly if they can get their guns on it, due to the thin turret armour and extremely thin roof armour. 

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|Oerlikon KDA (35 mm)}}
The vehicle is armed with two Swiss made 35 mm Oerlikon KDA cannons with a rate of fire of 550 RPM. As an SPAA, it can engage and track targets which move rapidly. Ammo pool is respectable at 460 rounds, and reloading at a point is rather quick as well.

==== Ammunition ====
The ItPsV 90 has 3 types of ammunition available:
* High-explosive incendiary tracer (HEI-T): the shells are self-destroying, but the self-destruction range is the same as the radar's lead indicator maximum distance, therefore making the shells practically unusable at longer ranges
* Armour-piercing incendiary tracer (API-T): they can be used extremely effectively against lightly-armoured vehicles and enemy SPAAs. Even though the damage to enemy aircraft is reduced unless hitting a critical module, because of the lack of HE filler. The shell can still be used outside of the radar range because it is not self destructive. Although it might not be able to penetrate heavier targets frontally, the guns will do short work of nearly every enemy vehicle from the side (even the heaviest IS tanks if one is able to aim and ricochet their shots well enough from the drive wheels) 
* High-velocity armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS): They can be used against targets mentioned above and provide way easier time due to their higher penetration, requiring less precise aiming to wound or destroy the target, but one should bear in mind the ammo amount is rather limited, so ammo should not be wasted needlessly. The APDS rounds can be used against aircraft and helicopters as well, but it is not advisable to do so due to their very limited count.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The ItPsV-90, or Ilmatorjuntapanssarivaunu 90, is a Finnish SPAAG. Used for low-air defense, the ItPsv-90 was used to shoot down low-flying aircraft and UAVs. Orignally, the ItPsV-90 was on a Polish T-55 tank hull used in the 1990s. Finland had several units until 2010, when the systems were moved into wartime storage. Five years later, in 2015, the systems were installed on the Leopard 2A4 hull. The ItPsV-90 variant in-game with the 2A4 hull would enter service for the Finnish army in 2016 and is still in use with 7 units made.
