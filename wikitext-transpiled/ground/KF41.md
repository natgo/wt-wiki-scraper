== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Hungarian light tank {{Battle-rating}} in the Italian research tree. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as part of the Hungarian branch of the Italian tech tree.

The KF41 is a modern IFV design from the German Rheinmetall company, exported to the Hungarian Army. It easily invites comparisons to the [[PUMA]] adopted by the Bundeswehr: both are large, heavily armoured vehicles with powerful engines and good transmissions that result in high mobility. They even feature the same 30 mm autocannon with APFSDS and AHEAD rounds. The main feature differences for this variant of the Lynx are a twin launcher for Spike fire-and-forget missiles and a unique AMAP-ADS hard-kill active protection system with scattered modules around the perimeter of the vehicle. However it lacks the PUMA's soft-kill APS, unmanned turret, and ERA/NERA, making it more vulnerable to attacks that the active protection system can't stop. Overall, the KF41 is a versatile, feature-packed IFV that can juggle multiple roles on the battlefield: standoff ATGM strikes and anti-helicopter duties on top of the basic flanking rushes.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Despite its contemporary design akin to the Puma IFV, the KF41 exhibits a notable shortfall in protection against conventional rounds, despite its capacity to intercept high-speed projectiles such as the DM53 and CL3143, which fall within the AMAP-ADS projectile speed threshold of 1,700 m/s. Nevertheless, it demonstrates commendable resilience against ATGMs and slower, high-caliber rounds, albeit exhibiting inconsistency in defense against non-missile or rocket projectiles. The inclusion of external fuel tanks positioned behind the Active Protection System serves to bolster armor capabilities, particularly against smaller caliber projectiles such as autocannons. However, the effectiveness of this additional protection is contingent upon various factors including impact angle, projectile type, and distance. The void spaces within the compartment enhance the vehicle's survivability, particularly when subjected to certain angles of attack.

Similar to the Puma, the crew compartment is compartmentalized, with the entire rear section, designated for infantry, remaining unoccupied. However, the absence of an unmanned turret represents a significant drawback, severely limiting the vehicle's ability to engage adversaries safely by exposing only the turret. A direct hit on the turret would result in near-immediate incapacitation. The primary survivability feature of the KF41 lies in its mobility and speed, enabling it to swiftly navigate the battlefield, evading enemy fire particularly in strategic chokepoints.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,790|rbMinHp=1,022}}The mobility of the KF41 falls short when compared to similar armored vehicles. Even heavily armored counterparts like the T-80BVM and Leopard 2 series boast higher top speeds and overall mobility, highlighting the KF41's relatively lackluster performance in combat, evidenced by its power-to-weight ratio of 26.3, in contrast to the T-80BVM's 27.2. Nonetheless, it maintains a respectable level of mobility, enabling the vehicle to swiftly navigate the periphery of the battlefield and deliver flanking maneuvers against enemy vehicles.

{{main|MK 30-2/ABM (30 mm)}}The KF41 is equipped with the Mauser MK 30 30mm automatic cannon, renowned for its powerful ammunition type and decent firing rate. While it may lack effectiveness against armored vehicles in direct engagements, it proves highly advantageous for flanking maneuvers and short-range anti-aircraft defense against helicopters or slow-moving, low-flying enemy jets. Operating within a group, it becomes instrumental in targeting critical components such as tracks or cannon barrels, thereby supporting allies engaged in frontal combat. It is advisable to utilize the APFSDS belt in most situations, reserving the AHEAD frag belt for engagements with aircraft or lightly armored vehicles.

{{main|Spike-LR2MR}}The KF41 is outfitted with Spike-LR2MR IR fire-and-forget missiles, which exhibit a somewhat inconsistent reliability. While they offer the potential as stand-off weapons effective against heavily armored targets as well as slow-moving, low-flying aircraft, their reliability can vary based on several factors including the target's speed, launch angle, distance, and the carrier's velocity. Despite featuring a small warhead, they can inflict significant damage on enemy tanks upon successful penetration. The positioning of the launcher enables quasi No Line-of-Sight launches and top-down attacks, contingent upon factors and the target's exposure level, albeit rendering the missile ineffective at distances shorter than 400m. Additionally, their capability for top-down attacks may encounter limitations, particularly against combat vehicles like Russian tanks equipped with additional ERA on the roof or heavily protected tanks featuring NERA components on the roof like the Strv 122 or Leopard 2A7. In summary, the Spike-LR2MR relies heavily on chance for its effectiveness.

== Usage in battles ==

The KF41can be likened to a larger-scale R3 T20 in its operational approach. Despite its armor offering limited protection against only certain types of threats, its agility and firepower lend themselves to a range of roles. In addition to its primary functions of flanking enemy positions and providing "combat medical" assistance, the KF41 excels as a platform for suppressive fire, capable of keeping adversaries pinned down while allies maneuver for advantageous positions. Furthermore, its designation as a budget anti-aircraft asset its adaptability in countering aerial threats, albeit with some limitations. While not equipped with the extensive defense systems of dedicated anti-aircraft platforms, its weaponry and its built-in IRST make it a formidable deterrent against helicopters and low-flying aircraft. On large scale battlefields like the Fields of Sinai, the KF41 emerges as a potent sniper unit, utilizing its Spike missiles to engage targets at extended ranges with precision and lethality. The strategic advantage of such long-range engagement capabilities cannot be overstated, allowing the KF41 to disrupt the enemy and neutralize high-value targets from afar. It's worth noting that while the KF41's Active Protection System provides an additional layer of defense, its reliability may vary in ground combat scenarios. However, commanders should always consider its potential effectiveness, particularly when facing off against airborne threats, where the APS can provide critical protection against incoming munitions.

=== Pros and cons ===

Rheinmetall initiated the development of the KF series of combat vehicles to fill a noticeable gap in the market for tracked vehicles. The company aimed to create a design versatile enough to outperform direct competitors while still being able to efficiently carry out peacetime operations.

The vehicle was first unveiled in its lighter KF31 configuration in June 2016 at the Eurosatory exhibition. This debut was soon followed by the heavier KF41 variant, unveiled at the same event in 2018. By 2020, Rheinmetall had entered negotiations with several potential operators, including Australia, the Czech Republic, and the United States. Hungary became the KF41's first official operator in September of that year, placing an order for 218 vehicles.
