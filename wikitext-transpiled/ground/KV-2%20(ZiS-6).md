The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.59 "Flaming Arrows"]] as a [[wt:en/news/3698-development-new-additions-to-the-kv-2-series-en|premium pack]] but was removed from the store at the end of the [[wt:en/news/5865-special-big-war-thunder-birthday-sale-en|2018 6th Anniversary]] sale. It was available from the store for a short time during the [[wt:en/news/6488-shop-black-friday-sale-en|2019 "Black Friday"]]. It was also made available for purchase in-game with Golden Eagles ({{GE}}) during the [[wt:en/news/7054-event-defender-of-the-fatherland-en|2021 "Defender of the Fatherland"]], and the [[wt:en/news/6368-special-tankers-day-celebrate-with-us-en|2019]], [[wt:ru/news/15896-akciya-s-dnyom-tankista-ru|2022]], and [[wt:en/news/8456-special-the-kv-2-zis-6-and-a-decoration-for-tanker-s-day-en|2023]] "Tankers' Day" mini-events and finally returned as a permanent premium vehicle you can buy with GE {{GE}} during the [[wt:en/news/8710-special-anniversary-of-lifting-the-siege-of-leningrad-get-the-kv-2-zis-6-and-earn-a-decal-decoration-en|2024 "Anniversary of lifting the Siege of Leningrad"]] mini-event.

This tank is a spiritual successor of the original KV-2 in combat operations. Despite its high crew count of 6, the rate of fire is relatively slow; it is however faster than the howitzer-equipped KV-2s, with a higher velocity and flatter trajectory. It does share the same unfortunately slow turret traverse, reverse, acceleration, and heavy weight.

Operational and visual characteristics of the KV-2 (ZiS-6) retain the visual and operational similarities to the KV-2 which it is upgraded from. Players experienced in operating previous models of the KV-2 or Soviet SPGs should have little to no difficulty in adjusting to this vehicle. The ZiS-6 can be distinguished from its KV and KV-2 predecessors by its enlarged and tall rectangular turret and longer barrel. A quick glance at this vehicle may be mistaken for similar looking tanks such as the KV-2 in which shares the same turret shape.

The KV-2 (ZiS-6)'s closest and most popular competitor of the same battle-rating is the [[KV-85]]. The KV-85 when compared, is free to unlock with currency spending, is lighter in weight, more manoeuvrable, faster in fire rate and turret traverse at the expense of fewer crew members. What the ZiS-6 lacks in these qualities may be compensated by its firepower comparable to a "mini-[[IS-2]]" as well as the added Premium talisman RP and SL increase bonus of which the KV-85 will lack on the get-go. These detail and information should be considered by the interested user when deciding whether to purchase this tank and incorporating it into their existing arsenal, or when taking into battle. The KV-2 (ZiS-6) will reward those who are patient, and is a boon to those seeking increased premium firepower unmatched by any other USSR vehicle at its rank.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Despite its significantly powerful armament, the KV-2 (ZiS-6) is plagued by many of the same weaknesses as all of the the KV lineage. At its battle rating, the tank's armour will be of little protection against other hostile vehicles it will face. With just 75 mm armour all around and including the largely flat and exposed turret, almost all tanks the ZiS-6 will face - a significant number of which have double the penetration value of the thickness of the KV's armour - will penetrate with little to no difficulty. This will more than likely cripple the crew to the point the rate of fire is reduced to virtually a standstill. Besides, tightly packed ammunition both within and at the base of the turret will turn the entire vehicle into an erupting volcano upon ammo rack detonation.

The armour protection of the KV-2 (ZiS-6) is really not great at its BR. The hull front and sides largely consist of 75 mm thick armour plates, which allow the player to angle the hull and increase its effective thickness to ~90-110 mm. However this is still penetrable by common opponents, such as [[Tiger H1]], [[M4A2 (76) W]], [[Chi-Nu (Family)|Chi-Nu]], etc. The biggest and most noticeable weakspot of this KV-2 is of course the huge and flat turret. Protected by 75 mm unsloped armour all round, the turret usually fails to resist incoming shells regardless of whether the player angles it or not. While the original KV-2 has a large bulge on the gun mantlet that can bounce/absorb shells, the KV-2 (ZiS-6) does not. The huge gun mantlet only has the gun barrel sticking out, making it even easier to penetrate. The only advantage brought by this all-round protection is probably that the KV-2 is immune to almost all SPAA (eg. [[Wirbelwind]], [[M19]]) or, when angling, low tier tanks. Opponents who deliberately bring low tier tanks (eg. [[M22]], [[Ho-Ro]]) into this BR will have a hard time trying to penetrate a KV-2 (ZiS-6). The roof armour is between 30-35 mm which can effectively block .50 cal AP bullets, commonly used by Allied planes like P-47D and P-51. However, some aircraft have the ability to penetrate this 30 mm of armour even from far away, for example the Do 335 B-2 whose MK 103 penetrate ~60 mm at ~600 m.

Thanks to the spacious interior and an abundance of crew (6), the KV-2 (ZiS-6) can usually survive a few penetrations in the turret or even in the hull. However as soon as spare crews run out, the KV-2 will once again be very vulnerable.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 775|rbMinHp= 531}}

As a KV-2 heavy tank, the {{PAGENAME}} has a slow top speed and HP ratio. However, the acceleration on the {{PAGENAME}} is pretty good: the top speed is reached within seconds on flat terrain, even off-road. Its slow speed won't let you reach the frontline quickly but its good cannon combined with its tall profile and average armour rather call for a playstyle at a good distance from the enemy. The reverse speed is average: it won't let you retreat quickly but isn't a handicap either. The lack of neutral steering makes turning on the spot slow (2 km/h): make sure to build a little speed before turning to increase it (4 km/h). The tracks are quite large and grant you a decent mobility on hard (solid ground, roads) and soft terrain (mud, snow, sand). The {{PAGENAME}} reaches 16 km/h when fording, it struggles at a meagre 4 km/h when climbing uphill from idling and 12 km/h uphill with some speed built-up. Due to its weight, the tank's mobility is unhindered by obstacles. The {{PAGENAME}} also brakes quickly and without skidding although it is a heavy tank.

{{main|ZIS-6 (107 mm)}}
The KV-2 (ZiS-6) is a heavy artillery tank. It is an experimental up-gunned variant of the [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1]] and [[KV-2 (Family)|KV-2]] models.  It was built with an emphasis of destroying fortifications, bunkers, and enemy armoured vehicles, and featured the new 107 mm ZiS-6 cannon.  While this vehicle has the same armour as the KV-1 and KV-2, this vehicle is notable for having a more powerful cannon; although smaller in calibre to the other KV-2 variants, the ZiS-6 has much higher armour penetration values. This tank will obliterate all enemy vehicles upon penetration with the exception of some lightly-armoured vehicles on which the contact fuse may fail to detonate.

The 107 mm ZiS-6 cannon, like many Soviet high-calibre cannons, has a few great strengths and some glaring weaknesses. In terms of ballistics, a close comparison in penetration would be the [[KwK36 (88 mm)|88 mm KwK36 cannon]] found on the [[Tiger I (Family)|Tiger I]], but the ZiS-6 has considerably more HE filler. The gun is fairly accurate out to one kilometre, but does suffer an occasional flyer.

As with most large-bore Soviet cannons, the biggest weakness is the long reload - almost 22 seconds with an untrained crew, and not much faster than 17 seconds with an Aced crew. The turret that the ZiS-6 is housed in offers no advantageous features - it is still in essence the same slow-traversing KV-2 turret found on the 152 mm models found at a lower BR. This means that the armour leaves much to be desired at the BR, and that the limited vertical guidance (particularly depression) will leave the ZiS-6 compromised in hilly terrain.

Due to the turret's slow traverse, limited vertical guidance, and the gun's very long reload, the KV-2 ZiS-6 is best used from longer ranges where it can utilize hard cover.

At its rank and battle rating, the KV-2 (ZiS-6)'s armour is no longer up to par against newer and more powerful weapon systems of opposition vehicles it will face. Although unlike the [[IS-1]] successor of which is unable to protect itself by angling due to the rounded turret mount causing a vulnerability, the KV-2 has less of this issue as the entire front potion of the front and lower-plate is designed to be straight and rectangular and allowing it to deflect or ricochet some shots when angled optimally but the large turret is extreme exposed and vulnerable to head-on fire.

Due to its unsatisfactory manoeuvrability, rate of fire and traverse speed, close-quarters engagements against multiple enemies in small-spaced environments are highly discouraged unless absolutely necessary. The tank is too large and slow to escape or retreat from what would be overwhelming situations, and too large to hide. Should the need to enter tight alleyways and streets if towns or cities, escort either by or with other friendly units are of utmost importance and should best serve in a support capacity should more heavily armoured opponents are encountered. This tank excels best at long to medium range engagements on largely open areas. Due to its poor -5 degrees of gun depression - a trait inherited by all USSR armoured vehicles, engaging hostiles by cresting over the tops of hills are highly discouraged unless absolutely necessary. Should clusters of multiple hostile vehicles are encountered in combat, the optimal tactic is to wait for them to split up before engaging them one-by-one if the opportunity presents itself.

Lightly armoured vehicles where the contact fuse may not activate upon penetration such as the [[Waffentrager]] or [[Nashorn]] are of the most concern as the default B-420 APHE shell has the tendency of penetrating from the front to rear dealing less damage than what is expected. Follow up shots may be required. Although the HE OF-420 shell is an excellent solution, the 16 .7 to 21.51 seconds of shell swap may not warrant enough justification for use when few seconds are only available to determines survival.

Another class of vehicles of significant threat are fast-tanks such as the [[M18 GMC]] or [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]] tanks capable of running circles in ways the KV-2 (ZiS-6)'s slow turret traverse rate and poor manoeuvrability will be unable to cope in close-quarters engagements. The last type of vehicle of concern are low-chassis tanks such as the [[ASU-57]], [[ASU-85]], [[PT-76B]] and even some German tank-destroyers are so small to the point they safely drive up to the vicinity of KV-2 and be immune from retaliation due to the 107 mm gun situated on a high turret and only -5° degrees of elevation down and 15° up

=== Pros and cons ===

In the late 1930s, the Soviet Directorate of Artillery, a part of the Soviet Ministry of Defense, issued a directive to design and build larger field artillery. By late 1937, going into 1938, proposals included both 95 mm calibre and 107 mm calibre. In the early 1940s, the Soviets had incorrectly received reports of up-armoured German tanks, leading them to question if their current 45 mm and 76 mm cannons were sufficient to combat the new German tanks. In response, the Soviets eventually drew up plans for the KV-4, to be armed with a ZiS-6 107 mm cannon. The 107 mm cannon passed factory tests in early 1941, and by mid 1941, had been mounted into the turret of a KV-2 for further testing and analysis. It was through this testing that the KV-2 with ZiS-6 cannon came into existence, as we see it in War Thunder.

Several hundred 107 mm ZiS-6 guns were created in anticipation of being fitted to the KV-4 and KV-5 heavy tanks. When the KV-4 was dropped in favour of the KV-5 (also to be armed with ZiS-6), and the KV-5 subsequently dropped due to the siege of Leningrad, all of the ZiS-6 guns were destroyed and scrapped, since the heavy tanks they were intended to be mounted in would never materialize.
