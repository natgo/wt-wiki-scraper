== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.61 "Road to Glory"]] in the "[[Operation S.U.M.M.E.R.]]" event of [[wt:en/news/4151-special-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-updated-03-08-2016-en/|2016]] that lasted from 22 July to 22 August, unlocked after obtaining 36 tanker Marks of Distinction.

The KV-220 is played almost like the previous KV iterations in the Soviet heavy tank line-up. The great improvement over the predecessors is the improved all-around armour to 100 mm, meaning that the tank can angle its hull with more confidence without revealing a side weak point or the such. The great armour, decent mobility, and adequate gun gives the KV-220 a diverse role to play in, from a short-range brawler, a support tank, and a long-range sniper.

The KV-220 is quite a heavy tank of its own calibre. With 100 mm of armour all around the hull and turret, the angling of the hull can be done to maximize both front and side armour without worry of exposing weak points. Not to mention for its weight, the KV-220 is quite agile. While the 85 mm gun is powerful by its own remarks, it is inferior to the same 85 mm gun that is on the [[IS-1]] that shares the same BR as the KV-220. This is because the 85 mm on the IS has access to the more potent BR-365A and APCR shells. Thus, the KV-220 provides a heavy tank with an impressive arrangement of armour with decent mobility, but with a gun that may feel lacking in the battlefield against other heavy tanks.

There is one frontal weak point on the KV-220, and that is the gun mantlet. Not that the gun mantlet area is easy to penetrate, but that it curves downwards on the lower end of the shape. This presents a shot trap able to be exploited by any gun to ricochet a round off that and into the hull roof, which is only 30 mm thick. Do note this when facing an enemy taking aim at the tank.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour
- Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Commander's cupola)

'''Notes:'''

- Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick
- Unlike most other Soviet heavy tanks, KV-220 have a crew of 6

The KV-220 has some of the best armour in its tier. While on paper it's just like German Tiger tank, in reality it can withstand much more opponents than the Tiger. The front has 30 degree slope that makes the armour even thicker. The sides of the turret and hull are also 100 mm, making KV-220 invulnerable when facing enemies at a 45 degree angle. Due to the all around 100 mm armour, KV-220 is invulnerable to all SPAA it might see from all directions.

The KV-220 has a crew of 6, making it harder to knock out. The side of the hull is also protected with fuel tanks which can absorb large amount of damage.

The only weak spot is the gun mantlet which is 90 mm thick. Penetrating this part of armour from the front is more promising than other parts when facing the KV-220. The gun mantlet is more flat compare to other parts, especially when the KV-220 is angled. It will also disable the cannon breech right behind the gun mantlet.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,097|rbMinHp=752}}

The KV-220 has a power-to-weight ratio of 13.6. But surprisingly the mobility of this tank is quite good despite the 62.7 tons of weight. The diesel engine has greater torque at lower RPM than similar gasoline engines, providing KV-220 great acceleration and higher cruise speed but lower top speed. Due to the great mobility in its class, the KV-220 can arrive at the front line with the medium tanks, holding better positions than the late-comers. Despite the good speed, its turn rate is relatively low.

{{main|F-30 (85 mm)}}

The KV-220 carries a 85 mm F-30 cannon. The firepower is not as good as the 122 mm D-25T cannon installed on IS-2 in the similar BR, but the F-30 cannon has much better fire rate - almost three times faster. The KV-220 also have a good gun depression of -6° when comparing to other soviet heavy tanks. Despite the good rate of fire and relatively good gun depression angle, the F-30 cannon is still not as good as other cannons installed on heavy tanks in the similar BR. Treat the KV-220 as a medium tank with heavy armour rather than a heavy tank.

{{main|DT (7.62 mm)}}

There is a coaxial 7.62 mm DT machine gun and another one installed in the commander's cupola. The usage of these machine guns is relative limited due to the small calibre. You may use the DT machine gun on commander cupola against air targets. You may get a hit if you are lucky. In most cases the machine guns are used to check if the target in the front is still alive or not.

'''Fighting tanks'''

- Tiger I [[Tiger H1|H1]]/[[Tiger E|E]] - They are usually very easy to destroy and protecting the KV-220 is easy with the right angle of armour, but one mistake and the 88 mm guns can eliminate the KV-220.
- [[M18 GMC|M18 Hellcat]] - Very fast and manoeuvrable. Do not let them flank, if they get onto the sides, they will be able to penetrate. Try to shoot them from a distance.
- Tiger II ([[Tiger II (P)|P]]/[[Tiger II (H)|H]]) - They are better than the KV-220 in every aspect. Try to avoid them and shoot them in their side.
- [[Pz.Bfw.VI_(P)|Panzerbefehlswagen VI (P)]] - Usually, the 85 mm can't penetrate their 200 mm frontal armour, so try to aim for the angled cheeks.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Long barreled 85 mm gun
- More well armoured than most tanks
- 100 mm of armour ''all around'', sides and rear aren't weaker than the front (Though the slight sloping gives the front about 15 more mm in effective armour)
- Great acceleration
- Machine gun turret can traverse 360 degrees
- 85 mm shell has great HE filler
- When angled properly, the tank can bounce or soak up many shots
- Lots of ammo (91 rounds)
- Game changer, as it's very hard to dislodge a well positioned KV-220 especially when the player knows it perks
- 6 crew for large damage sponge
- Good gun depression

'''Cons:'''

- Very sluggish in turns.
- Tall profile and hull is longer than other KV and IS series tank
- Despite firing the BR-365A used on the other 85 mm armed tanks, this gun mounted on the KV-220 is among the earliest model, so it has lower penetration rating compared to others
- Slow turret traverse speed
- Only two types of ammo available (APHEBC and HE)
- Lower gun mantlet is a shot trap - Can direct ricochets into hull roof
- Some ammo will be stored in the turret rear if carrying full ammo
- Unlike other tanks, losing a loader will hinder the loading process by a large margin

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The KV-220 was a further development of the Kliment Voroshilov heavy tank series. It is one of the prototypes of the KV-3 tank. The design of the prototypes starts in 1940, when they designed two different designs: T-150 (or 150, Object 150, KV-150) and T-220 (or 220, Object 220, KV-220). The T-150 had thinner armour - 90 mm all around and a weaker engine. The T-150 was approved as KV-3 if it entered production. KV-220 on the other hand had thicker armour and a larger engine compared to its brother, but it also resulted in problems due to new engine and heavier weight. Also the army was not satisfied with the 85 mm F-30 cannon. The F-30 cannon was replaced by a 107 mm F-39 cannon similar to the ZIS-6 cannon on [[KV-2 (ZiS-6)]]. KV-220 entered further development as Object 221, 222 and 223 for different cannons. Only one prototype was ever built. The German invasion stopped the production of KV-3 and the development of KV-220 series.
