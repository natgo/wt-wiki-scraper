== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|九八式軽戦車「ケニ」|Kyūhachi-Shiki Kei-Sensha [Ke-Ni]}}) was a light tank prototype to replace and improve on the Ha-Go, built with a smaller silhouette and primarily focused as a light tank instead of a general purpose tank like the Ha-Go. It included some unconventional design choices for a Japanese tank: due to the small size of the tank and only having a driver in the hull, the machine gun was moved to the turret in a coaxial mount, and it had armour improvements and a Christie suspension. While a very promising tank, high command didn't feel the need to replace the adequately performing Type 95 Ha-Go's against the little Chinese armour they faced.

The Ke-Ni was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]]. Being a small and zippy tank, it plays very similarly to the [[M22]]; while the cannon isn't completely up-to-par, it does offer APHE to deal some post-penetration damage. It's best used in flanks and hitting enemy tanks from the side.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
With around 12 mm of armour all around, this tank is barely bulletproof. German and British machine guns can even knock you down at point-blank range. Your crew is cramped and not numerous, which makes surviving a shot extremely unlikely. This is definitely not the tank to expose to any kind of shots. With its small turret and impressive gun depression, hull-down positions improve this vehicle's survivability and should be sought whenever possible.

'''Armour type:'''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=141|rbMinHp=115}}

This tank is quite fast and can achieve surprising feats of mobility. Coupled with a good turret traverse speed, this tank can be reliably used in flanking manoeuvres. With its narrow tracks and good power-to-weight ratio, this tank is fast on almost any ground but easily loses speed on rough terrain, steep hills, and sharp turns. Another good characteristic of this tank is its reverse speed of -7 km/h, which allows it to effectively use overextend tactics (peek-a-boo).

{{main|Type 100 (37 mm)}}

Offering an improved gun and ammunition selection compared to the [[Ha-Go]], this tank offers a good learning curve from its predecessor. Though this cannon does not have the best penetration at rank I, the trademark Japanese APHE has a good amount of HE filler and ensures that each penetrating shot deals damage. The gun only has one type of ammunition.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Being a light tank, the Ke-Ni cannot engage enemies head-on. To succeed in an assault, you need to be sneaky. Flanking, avoiding the enemy and going behind them is your best option. The 37 mm gun can penetrate most Rank I tanks if you hit their weak spots, though it may take a few shots to destroy an enemy. Your first shot should be to take out the enemy gunner so they can't retaliate. After that, take out their driver so they can't retreat. Never linger in an open field since anything can kill you with ease. Use your good gun depression to keep a hull-down position behind hills and just pop out to shoot. Hide in bushes or behind buildings or rocks. You are quite small, so use this to your advantage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Low profile
* Slightly improved 37 mm cannon able to penetrate the majority of rank 1 tanks it faces
* Coaxial machine gun (rare for a early Japanese tank)
* Large ammo load
* Short reload time
* Small engine, which is hard to hit from the front
* Good turret traverse
* -15° of depression
* Has shoulder lock, which is a primitive form of the vertical stabiliser
* Good reverse speed (-7 km/h)

'''Cons:'''

* Relatively little armour, can be penetrated by 12.7 mm machine guns
* Hard to angle due to the shape of the armour
* Only 3 crew members
* Crew is cramped
* Only one ammunition choice, can have difficulty dealing with heavily armoured tanks

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== Development ===
The '''{{specs|name}}''' was a replacement program started in 1938, for the [[Ha-Go|Type 95 Ha-Go]]. The tank was supposed to have the same weight but with thicker armour. During development both Hino Motors and Mitsubishi Industries built a prototype being the Chi-Ni* Model A (Ko) and Chi-Ni* Model B (Otsu) respectively. As Hino built a suspension similar to on the [[Ha-Go]], Mitsubishi went for a similar design to the Christie suspension. During trails the Model A performed stunningly better, especially offroad and was adopted as the Type 98 Ke-Ni.

But as the battle results of the [[Ha-Go]] came in, the Army realized the poor strength and disorganization of the Chinese army was no issue for the adequate ageing Ha-Go and didn't need direct replacement.

Only with the start of the Pacific war high command started taking note of how the American's .50 cal is enough to punch through the rather thin armour of the Ha-Go and eventually gave the light tank improvement contract to Hino with effective production starting in 1942. Though as many Japanese tanks and army manufacturing, production would be hampered by the Navy's resource priority leaving the total amount of Ke-Ni's built rather low at roughly 104 built.

{{Notice|*Not to be confused with the Chi-Ni medium tank prototype.}}

=== Design ===
Comparing the Ke-Ni to the [[Ha-Go]], it featured thicker, welded armour of improved shape, the height of the tank was 50 cm lower in profile and slightly lighter and shorter. With the use of a Mitsubishi Type 100 6-Cylinder air-cooled diesel engine with 130 horsepower, it allowed the vehicle to travel at 50 km/h (31 mph) even with its thicker armour.

Three pairs of bogies with six road-wheels connected to the chassis using bell cranks, this gave the tank better stability over its predecessor which only had two pairs of bogies with four road-wheels which was a major complaint of Ha-Go crew as it would rock the tank on unfavourable terrain.

The driver was located in a central position of the chassis and received a standard wheel.

In contrast to the one-man turret of [[Ha-Go|Type 95 Ha-Go]], the Type 98 had a two-man turret, which featured additional room for a loader next to the gunner/commander. The gun was a [[Type 100 (37 mm)|Type 100 37 mm tank gun]] with vertical elevations of -15 to +20 degrees in the turret, a muzzle velocity of 760 m/s, and also a coaxial [[Type 97 (7.7 mm)|Type 97 (7.7 mm) machine gun]] instead of in the back of the turret.
