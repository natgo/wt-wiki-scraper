== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Swedish-owned Tiger II (P), acquired from the French in late 1947. Sweden had been looking into buying German tanks for evaluation and trials for research purposes. In early October 1946, Sweden sent a military delegation to France to select from surplus German equipment at Versailles earmarked for scrapping. After some negotiations, Sweden was allowed to choose three examples free of charge, which led to a request for a King Tiger of the highest quality they could find. The Swedish delegation was taken to Normandy to search for a King Tiger in acceptable condition. They were shown one example, which was in poor condition and had been burnt out, which the Swedish military delegation deemed unsuitable for transportation to Sweden.

Sweden still wanted to acquire a King Tiger, so the following day, the French promised to find a vehicle in better condition than the one previously shown. It wasn't until August 1947 that the delegation received news of a well-preserved King Tiger found south of Paris. It wouldn't be until late November that the King Tiger arrived in Stockholm and was then sent onwards to P 4 in Skövde, arriving in December of the same year. There, it was evaluated and subsequently sent for trials.

The Kungstiger was introduced during [[Update "Alpha Strike"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XV, "Northern King"]]. It is similar to the German [[Tiger II (P)]], thus providing a heavy tank for the Swedish tree that most players will be familiar with, both in terms of playing and facing. The long 88 mm KwK43 gives it the ability to engage and neutralise targets at distance, with powerful penetration capabilities it will have little to no trouble dealing with most hostile vehicles except heavily armoured ones like the [[Maus]] and [[T95]], or angled armoured heavy tanks like the IS-4M, which might pose some issues for the Kungstiger. However, similar to the Tiger II (P), the Kungstiger has excellent hull armour but shares the same weak spots due to its early production turret, where the cheeks present a simple area for enemies to penetrate with most shells exceeding 100 mm penetration. To counter this, the Kungstiger is best used in long-range engagements where it's more difficult to acquire a precise aim on the turret cheeks. Overall, the Kungstiger is an excellent vehicle that bolsters the Swedish lines with a hard-punching, well-armoured option.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

*Turret front armour is only 100 mm thick, but it is rounded, with varying angles (between 0-55°). Middle part is unangled and is the weakest part of the turret.
*Turret has some major flaws, like a shot trap, and exposed, vulnerable turret ring (80-100 mm thick and no angle at all).
*Commander's cupola on top of the turret is 100 mm thick, but quite well angled.
*Lower glacis is only 100 mm thick, but it is not a weak spot (over 200 mm effective angled).
*Machine gun port could be marked as close-range weak spot. Although most of it is still 150 mm thick, the angling is much worse. But targeting the turret is preferable.

'''Notes:'''

*Recommended ammo load is 23 to keep the hull empty and both ready racks full.
*Ammo racks 7 and 8 are ready racks, and takes priority in being filled at the beginning of the battle, then fills 1 through 6 in that order.
*Full reload speed will be realized as long as ammo exists in either ready rack. If both ready racks are empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
*Simply not firing the main gun when it is loaded will load ammo from racks 1-6 into 8 then 7, as long as there is ammo in racks 1-6. Firing the main gun will interrupt the loading of the ready racks.
*Thanks to the ready rack feature found on this tank, the first and second ammo racks found in the back of the turret will always be full of ammo, making it the prime target for enemy tankers who are looking to detonate your ammo rack. Even solid shots like APCR and APDS that commonly pierce your front turret can make their way to the rear of the turret, potentially hitting the ready rack and can cause a critical hit to become a deadly one.
