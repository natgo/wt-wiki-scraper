== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The L6/40 31 Rgt. (introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]]) is a tracked light tank made by Ansaldo for the Royal Italian army during the 1940's. The L6/40 would be based on a heavily modified L3 chassis, keeping the two-person crew, but with an increase in firepower, protection and mobility. It would be heavily used during the occupation of the balkans where it did prove it worth. It would be armed with the [[Breda Mod.35 (20 mm)|20 mm Breda Mod.35]] autocannon which was able to fire a multitude of munitions, this included the Perforante mod.35 and the German made PzGr 40. In game this armament is more than adequate for its battle rating as the majority of the enemies it will face do not have a lot of armour. It also has great turret rotation which is something which will be useful when flanking or when the enemy team flanks you. Mobility wise its not too bad either, what it lacks in however is survivability, the crew placement means that a well placed shot will instantly destroy your vehicle, and due to the lackluster armour you will more often than not be taken out even by low calibre guns. It's best if you stick with your more armoured allies if you wish to stay in the fight longer.

;Combat tactics

The L6/40 possesses a level of versatility which allows it to play in a variety of roles with varying efficiency. As a frontline tank, one must maintain a short engagement distance (up to 200 m if possible) and exploit its small size to hide in almost all types of cover. The autocannon's efficiency will allow the player to dispatch of most enemies even frontally, and can knock out cannon barrels and tracks if it is unable to.

Flanking is another way to best use the tank's advantages. It is relatively mobile and the autocannon will be more reliable against the side armour of the enemy vehicles. Additionally, by flanking, one will artificially increase the L6/40's survivability, as it is not going to be the main target of fire in the initial stages of the player's ambush. This removes the reliance on the protection which, as previously mentioned, is not an aspect that will consistently save it.

Playing at range and sniping is almost pointless as the armament quickly loses penetration over range and struggles to penetrate even lightly armoured opponents.

Whichever playstyle one chooses, it is important to always play to the strengths of the vehicle, mainly the automatic armament and reactive turret traverse speed.

;Notable enemies

* Heavily armoured tanks that can negate the 20 mm rounds such as the [[FCM.36]], [[S.35]], and [[Valentine Mk I]].
* Tanks with sloped armour that can ricochet the rounds such as the [[H.39]], [[T-60]], [[T-70]], or [[T-80]].

;How to defeat a L6/40

Stay at a distance of at least 500 m to negate its firepower. If the L6/40's armour profile is unangled, fire at the front plate underneath the turret to guarantee the incapacitation of the crew. If the tank is heavily angled, a shot into the very thin side armour will likely penetrate. Finally, if the L6/40 is adequately angled and neither the front nor side can be penetrated, the player's best shot is to fire at the corner plate between the front and side, which normalizes upon angling. This is one's only chance to fire at a flat plate in this situation.

=== Pros and cons ===

'''Pros:'''

* Potent armament with good penetration and damage output
* Great turret rotation
* Good acceleration
* Adequate mobility

'''Cons:'''

* Poor suspension damping, it takes about 2 seconds to settle after stopping the vehicle
* Limited crew of 2
* Low rate of fire
* Limited magazines of 8 rounds
* Hull side can be penetrated by 0.50 cal machine guns

{{main|L6/40#History|l1=History of the L6/40}}

The story of the L6/40 began during the late 1930s, Ansaldo assisted by FIAT were creating a multitude of prototypes in the hopes that it would take over many of the roles of the L3 Tankette. Ansaldo would mainly take on the idea and the doctrine of mountain combat when designing new vehicles; due to the Italian involvement in WW1, they thought that allowing a vehicle to be easily transported to the tops of high mountains would ultimately give them the upper hand if in the future there was a chance for another world war to take place.

This is exactly what they did with the L6/40: they kept the vehicle as light as possible. It would be based on a heavily modified L3 chassis, keeping the two-person crew, but with increased firepower, protection, and mobility. The L6/40 as previously stated, would be designed with mountain-worthy combat specifications in mind. The vehicle had a width of 1.8 metres, this allowed it to travel on all the mountain roads and mule trails that other vehicles of the era would have a much harder time passing through. Its weight would overall be 6.84 tonnes, its name stood for L for Light, 6 for its weight, and 40 for its year of adoption in the Royal Italian Army.

By the time it was accepted for service in early 1940, it was adequate as a reconnaissance tank and as a general support vehicle to supplement infantry and other armoured columns when travelling. However, when it entered general service in 1942 it was hopelessly obsolete, mainly due to the fact that the Italian industry was not able to compete with other nations like the USSR and the USA. Italy created many designs for armoured vehicle during the era too, so it wasn't really a priority for them to try and rectify the vehicle by improving on it without wasting precious resources into the project. In fact, after 283 units had been built, it was cancelled in favour of the [[47/32 L40|Semovente 47/32]].

The main characteristic that made the L6/40 stand-out whilst it was being designed was its mobility, it used a FIAT SPA Tipo 18vt liquid-cooled engine which allowed the vehicle to reach speeds of up to 42 km/h. The L6/40's range was 200 km. In terms of armament, the L6/40 used the 20 mm Breda 35, it was installed on a multitude of vehicles at the time. The cannon was able to fire rounds such as the Italian Perforante mod.35 and the German PzGr.40.

In terms of service, the L6/40 was used in the Raggruppamento Esplorante Corazzato (RECo), the divisional-level armoured reconnaissance task forces found in the order of battle of armoured and motorized divisions, and in several independent reconnaissance units deployed in 4-car platoons. In total, 72 were sent to North Africa, and 55 went to Russia on March 1942, where they equipped the 67th Battaglione Motocorazzato Bersaglieri (lightly armoured battalion) in the 3rd Celere (Cavalry) Division. They were the heaviest Italian tanks used on that front. The battalion was destroyed in December 1942 during fighting on the Don River. L6/40 was also employed in Yugoslavia, by the San Guisto light armoured squadron-group of the 1st Celere Division. The L6/40 would proceed to be used all the way to the end of the war, but also would be extensively used post-war by the Celere police force. Some may have survived and remained in service in subsequent years. Some L6/40's have also survived to this day, one can be found in Legnano in Italy, one is in the inventory of the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia, and another is preserved in the Arms Museum in the castle of Gjirokastër in Albania.

'''Service in the 31 Rgt.'''

This particular example of the L6/40 was used by the Italian 31 Rgt to counter guerrilla warfare in the Balkans, specifically in Albania in the years of 1942 and 1943. This L6/40 would also provide protection to key infrastructure in captured Yugoslavian territory. The Italian army would operate up to 55 units of this vehicle in that theatre. This L6/40 has a Lion painted on it, which acted as a sort of mascot for troops stationed there. After the armistice most of the units operating there would be taken by the German army.
