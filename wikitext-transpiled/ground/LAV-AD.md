=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The LAV-AD's mobility is rather superb. As a wheeled vehicle, it has good speed on roads. Despite being similar in appearance and having a weaker engine than the [[M1128]], the LAV-AD accelerates much faster due to its lighter weight, resulting in a higher power-to-weight ratio, and it also has a slightly faster reverse speed. The engine is also relatively quiet, allowing for stealthy movements and ambushes.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|GAU-12U (25 mm)}}

The main armament of the LAV-AD is the 25 mm GAU-12U rotary autocannon. It functions similarly to the 20 mm [[M168 (20 mm)|M168]] Vulcan found on the [[M163]] earlier on in the tech tree, but with a reduced ammo capacity of only 1,000 rounds total (500 ready, 500 reserve instead of 1,100 ready, 1,100 reserve) and fire rate (1,800 rpm instead of 3,000 rpm) due to the limited room in the vehicle and larger calibre ammunition. The gun is also fully stabilized, with handling akin to that of the [[HSTV-L]]; slower than the [[M163]] and [[M247]] Sergeant York but still fast enough to react to most aerial targets at close range, particularly helicopters and slow, low-flying jets. Like most other AAs, it comes with a Default, AP, and HE belt. The Default belt has a 1:1 AP to HE ratio and is the only belt the vehicle has access to when stock. The HE belt has a 3:1 HE to AP ratio while the AP belt has a 3:1 AP to HE ratio. The former is more effective against aircraft while the latter is more effective against armoured vehicles. The AP round is the same across all belts, and can penetrate 91 mm of armour at point blank range. Combined with the relatively high fire rate, it can easily destroy barrels, tracks, and machine guns with ease as well as being able to shred light vehicles.

{{main|Hydra 70}}

The LAV-AD also has access to Hydra 70 M247 rockets with a researchable modification. This modification gives the vehicle an additional weapon set-up, replacing the Stinger pod above the main gun with a Hydra 70 rocket pod with 19 rockets, similar to those found on [[AH-1 (Family)|AH-1 Cobras]] and [[AH-64 (Family)|AH-64 Apaches]]. The Hydras are fired as a secondary weapon.

{{main|FIM-92 Stinger}}

The LAV-AD also comes with [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missiles. The missiles are IR guided, meaning they require a lock-on before firing. The vehicle has FIM-92Es by default and can unlock FIM-92Ks as a later modification. These are the same Stinger missiles used by the [[Ozelot]] in the German tech tree and function the same way. The missiles are launched as special weapons.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In battles, the player can either use the LAV-AD as an AA or in an anti-tank role. By using the LAV's fast speed, the player can easily reach deep into enemy territory where enemies are less vigilant compared to when they're near the frontline. The player can use this advantage by either hiding and waiting for planes to be distracted on friendly tanks and shooting them down or used to attack unsuspecting SPAAs and IFVs/light tanks from mid range and then closing up close to killing MBTs, having the rocket pod unlocked makes quick work of enemy armour if you can get on their flanks additionally the LAV can be used a very good bait against the enemy to lure their concentration while you teammates may shoot the said tank.

'''Against Aircraft'''

The LAV's stingers are decent but they are easy to notice and evade with their smoke trail, leading to the use of 2-3 Stingers to get a hit. While the gun has a fast rate of fire, it has a terrible drop over distance, meaning it is a bit harder to hit but you have a lead indicator upon locking on the aircraft. The best option is to lure the plane into thinking it is safe and engage it with the 25 mm gun under 3 km range to minimize the chance of survival and launch a Stinger at the plane if you did not fully kill it with the 25 mm.

'''Against Tanks'''

The LAV is mobile, outpacing most light tanks at its BR, and can use this to its advantage by reaching the enemy territory and flanking SPAAs and light tanks. Against MBTs, the LAV's 25 mm can penetrate the side armour of most MBTs, but the post-penetration damage is very weak. However, against Soviet armour, the LAVs struggles to penetrate the side armour. In such cases, bringing the 70 mm Hydra pod is a good choice. The LAV-AD can  knock out most MBTs with 2 HEAT grenades. Combined with its good mobility, the 70 mm Hydra make the LAV a beast if given a solid flank.

'''Threats'''

In the LAV-AD, anything above a 12.7 mm calibre poses a big threat to the player. In such cases, it is recommended to knock out the enemy vehicle with autocannons first as they can shred the LAV, Large calibre tank shells can overpenetrate the tank without detonating and therefore do minimal damage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has access to Hydra 70 rockets
* The 25 mm GAU-12U cannon shreds any air vehicles in its range
* The 25mm GAU-12U has no tracers making enemy planes/tanks harder to notice your location when firing
* Highly mobile thanks to its light weight and is also amphibious
* Can carry up to 16 SAMs if you choose to not have Hydras
* Has access to 2nd generation thermal sights for the gunner
* Has optical tracking meaning air targets will not receive RWR pings when locked onto
* Comes with smoke grenades stock
* Laser rangefinder automatically adjusts the sights
* Not equipping Hydras enables the Stingers to be fired in relatively quick succession with no reload
* Can fire Stingers while on the move

'''Cons:'''

* Stinger SAMs only have a maximum overload of 10G and has difficulty overcoming even basic defensive maneuvers 
* Long reload for the 25 mm gun
* Bringing the Hydra rocket pod reduces the number of available Stingers and gives them a lengthy reload time after 4 have been launched
* Penetrable by heavy machine gun fire and is prone to overpressure damage
* Shorter missile range and lacks a search radar when compared to its contemporaries like the [[Roland 1]], [[FlaRakPz 1]], and [[XM975]] at the same BR
* MAW detects missile launches and Stingers are prone to being diverted by flares
* No proximity-fused ammunition
* Hydra rockets are hard to aim due to their low velocity and do not work properly with the laser rangefinder
* Low sight FOV and relatively high zoom levels makes it hard to use against multiple targets up close
* 25 mm gun is inaccurate at longer ranges

=== [[wt:en/news/7598-development-lav-ad-revolving-firepower-en|Devblog]] ===

Development of the LAV-AD began in 1987 after a contract was signed with both the FMC Corporation and General Electric to design a SPAA variant for the LAV-25 for the USMC. Both companies began developing a system based on the USMC requirements that it had to be armed with a 25 mm cannon and possess provisions for mounting Stinger missiles and Hydra-70 rockets. While the FMC company opted to outfit their design with the same M242 cannon used on the base model of the LAV-25, General Electric decided to go for the GAU-12 'Equalizer' Gatling style rotary cannon.

Having reviewed both prototypes, the USMC decided to procure General Electric's design, placing an initial order for 125 vehicles to be produced. By 1996, the LAV-AD had formally been adopted into service. Despite the initial plans to produce over 100 vehicles, only 17 were actually manufactured due to funding issues. In 1998, the final unit was delivered to the USMC and further development of the vehicle was discontinued due to high maintenance costs. Among other operations, the LAV-AD was used in combat action in Iraq.
