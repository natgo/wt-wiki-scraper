== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], obtainable by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aWlXvWK9Kw using the affiliate link of YouTuber TheRussianBadger].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Its large and spacious hull might seem hard to knock out all of its crew, but that's only true when you are getting shot from the side. From your side, there is a huge empty area between the driving compartment and the fighting compartment that will absorb any shell, regardless of their explosive fillers. However an experienced player will know to shoot at these two compartments and avoid the empty space. From the front, the spacious hull does not help to keep the crew safe as a penetrating shell will travel through the empty space and hit any crew at the back, so you could die sooner than you expected. Avoid tanks with solid shots, for example British/Swedish tanks.
The deadliest threats are HMG and autocannon mounted vehicles such as the Pz.IIs, T-60, and AA guns. They can quickly chew through all of the crew.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Machine gun shield)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Use the LVT(A)(1)'s ability to sneak up waterways to work around the enemy lines, and ambush when possible. If that is not a option, come at them head on, either taking their vehicle out or disabling it long enough to get around and finish it with a side shot. Once done, do not take the waterways back as the LVT(A)(1) is much faster on land. This tank has the capability to work as an early assault tank, not as fast as the Stuarts, BTs and other light tanks. Another tactic that can be done against lightly armoured vehicles is to drive backwards towards the enemy. The combined firepower of 3 machine guns and the cannon increases the chance of take out the enemy before they can take out the LVT(A)(1). The big thing to keep in mind is that the LVT(A)(1) is big. It is a large target that is hard to hide, but the spacious interior makes it harder for enemies to take out all of the crew members. At the same time, keep in mind that the LVT(A)(1) is an easy target for aircraft, as the vehicle presents as very easy target for anything .50 cal and up.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Very fast and manoeuvrable on most terrain
* 6 crew members
* Fast-firing and accurate 37 mm gun
* Crew members are spread out, less likely to get knocked out in one shot
* Great gun depression at the side and front
* Heavily armoured gun mantlet
* 2 machine gunners that can fire at high angles, enabling anti-air
* Small engine makes it hard to hit
* Reserve tank (no repair costs)
* Amphibious (the first reserve floating tank)
* Spaced crew

'''Cons:'''

* Huge target
* Barely any armour to speak about
* Exposed lower glacis
* Weak armour and huge size makes it vulnerable to artillery
* Can easily be destroyed by HE shells (overpressure)
* Very slow reverse speed can prevent it from retreating back to cover in time
* Unstable aim while moving
* Bad suspension makes it unstable at humps
* Very slow speed when traveling in water
* Water rocks the tank when moving, making it unstable during and a while after movement in the water
* Poor gun depression in the rear in combination with its size makes it hard to hit smaller tanks who attack from the rear
