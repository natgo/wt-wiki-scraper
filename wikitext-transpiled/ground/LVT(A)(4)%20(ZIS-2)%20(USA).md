== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]] as a reward vehicle for the [[wt:en/news/4416-special-war-thunder-winter-holiday-en|2016 "Winter Holiday"]] event. It was later reintroduced in [[wt:en/news/6120-news-how-can-you-get-premium-vehicles-warbonds-en|April 2019]] as a battle trophy vehicle in the [[Warbonds]] shop.

Being based off the LVT(A)(1) with the difference of a new turret that hosts a Soviet ZIS gun, offering much more firepower compared to its counterpart.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Its large and spacious hull might seem hard to knock out all of its crew, but that's only true when you are getting shot from the side. From your side, there is a huge empty area between the driving compartment and the fighting compartment that will absorb any shell, regardless of their explosive fillers. However an experienced player will know to shoot at these two compartments and avoid the empty space. From the front, the spacious hull does not help to keep the crew safe as a penetrating shell will travel through the empty space and hit any crew at the back, so you could die sooner than you expected. Avoid tanks with solid shots, for example British/Swedish tanks.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Machine gun shield)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=355|rbMinHp=221}}

The LVT's mobility is adequate. On hard surfaces it easily reaches its top speed of around 38 km/h. On soft surfaces it needs more time to accelerate, and the top speed is lowered. The hull traverse is great, allowing you to quickly change direction, however a downside is that when you turn the hull to aim, you might over-turn and swing the gun past the target, increasing the aiming time which can be fatal.

Due to its big and tall tracks, the LVT can drive over some obstacles that are too tall for normal-sized tanks.

LVT(A)(4) ZIS-2 is a fragile tank with a strong bite. The main gun is a very powerful Soviet 57 mm ZIS-2 that has no problem penetrating through the hardest of enemies at its BR. Being such a large tank it has amazing manoeuvrability that works on most terrain. Its high profile makes it an easy target for the enemy to spot from afar and behind objects, fences and hills. Since the LVT(A)(4) has such thin hull armour, it is vulnerable to machine gun and autocannon fire. This makes Self Propelled Anti-Air vehicles and vehicles with 20 mm automatic cannons a lethal enemy, but that is not all the worries, large-calibre guns with HEAT and HE can penetrate with ease and cause detonation on the soft armour of the LVT(A)(4).

LVT(A)(4) ZIS-2 has decent speed and is manoeuvrable enough to handle close combat even lacking a full 360° turret. But, to best counter the most dangerous of enemies, utilize the long gun to its advantage.

You should memorise certain spots on different maps to make the most out of your amazing firepower. Pick spots that:

* Overlook a key passageway/street
* Are not too close or too far from the frontline
* Have hard cover/slopes around
* Are mostly flat (as your gun depression is bad and gun is mounted very high)
* Have some vegetation, if possible

This way you can sit at a comfortable spot, stay away from most dangers and target opponents that appear. The rather flat trajectory of your gun does not require as much elevation when shooting at distant targets which is beginner friendly, however the shell velocity is not fast, so you have to lead more than you think for moving targets. Because this is a sniper's tactic, if you are to bush up for better concealment, it is recommended to stack all bushes onto the upper front of the LVT. This is because you will mostly face targets from one direction only (your front) so you just have to cover up the front. The lower glacis does not need as much bush as it will usually get blocked by vegetations on the ground, acting as natural camouflage. 

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

[[M4A3 (105) (France)]]: this low-tier Sherman is one tough tank to destroy, but luckily your LVT is one of the few that can destroy it with ease (most of the time). Within 500 m, your default shell can easily penetrate its frontal/side armour with an appropriate angle. You can also penetrate its turret between the edge of the gun mantlet and the gun barrel. A penetrating shell is very likely to knock out most of its crew. However, when it's angling, hull down, or more than 500 m away, either aim really carefully at the turret or wait until it reveals other weak spots (eg. side). Note that you will be easily knocked out by its HEAT shell so avoid getting hit by it.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very powerful cannon for its BR: 145 mm penetration can effectively go through any tank frontally, even in an uptier; upon penetration the 20 g TNT does a great job at finishing off most, if not all the crew
* Good speed and manoeuvrability
* Five crew members with huge space between them increases survivability, especially when most guns it faces have small calibre and little explosive filler (eg. the [[M3 Stuart (Family)|Stuarts']] 37 mm)
* Decent horizontal gun traverse of 50° for a turretless design
* Well-angled turret can lead to some shells bouncing
* Is amphibious, meaning it can launch surprise attacks using rivers

'''Cons:'''

* Huge and tall hull makes it easy to be seen/shot at
* Very thin armour, can be penetrated by any cannon/heavy MG
* Easily destroyed with overpressure by large-calibre HE or HEAT shells, such as the [[Chi-Ha]]'s 57 mm HEAT shell
* Below-average 5° gun depression plus the tall hull makes it quite difficult to fight in hilly terrain
* Very slow reverse speed can prevent it from retreating back to cover in time
* The crew in the open topped turret are very close together, meaning they can be taken out in a single shot or by aircraft
* The turret has a limited traverse, making it vulnerable to flanking enemies
* Poor zoom of the gunsight makes it hard to see and aim at distant targets

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The LVT series of tracked amphibious vehicles originated from a pre-war civilian design, the ''Alligator'' hurricane rescue vehicle which had been designed by Donald Roebling (1908-1959) in 1935. An article on a further development of this vehicle in 1937 caught the attention of the US Marine Corps, but initially the proposal of militarising the Alligator met resistance both from the US Navy, who felt conventional landing craft could do the job just as well, and from Roebling himself, who disliked the idea of his vehicle being used for military purposes. The outbreak of war in Europe persuaded Roebling into building it anyway, and by May of 1940 he had completed a militarised prototype, which was tested in November 1940 and subsequently approved for production.

Even before the first prototype had been tested, Roebling had started designing a turret-equipped armed version of his LVT, intended for providing fire support for landings. Originally the design languished, but in June of 1941 the USMC recommended the development of a fire support version of the LVT. Development of this variant was slow, as the entire LVT had to be redesigned: light armour was added to the hull and a 37 mm armed turret similar to that of the M3 Stuart light tank was mounted on top, resulting in the initial fire support variant, the LVT(A)(1).

Combat experience with the LVT(A)(1) soon showed that the 37 mm gun was insufficient for fire support purposes, so the original M3 Stuart turret was replaced by that of a 75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8, creating the LVT(A)(4) variant, of which 1890 were built. Of these, several dozen were delivered to Nationalist China under the Lend-Lease Agreement.

In KMT service, the LVT(A)(4) ended up being used both against the Japanese forces during World War II, as well as against the PLA during the ensuing civil war. Most of them eventually fell into PLA hands. The lack of western supplies meant that ammo soon became sparse for the 75 mm M3 Howitzer gun mounted by the LVT(A)(4); to keep them useful as well as to bolster the number of available armoured vehicles in the PLA inventory, the LVT(A)(4)s were locally converted to either accept the 37 mm M6 tank gun - essentially retrofitting them to LVT(A)(1) status - or the 57 mm ZIS-2 anti-tank gun - identical to the gun used on the [[ZiS-30]] tank destroyer, and technically similar to the ZiS-4 gun used on both the [[T-34-57]] and the [[SU-57B]].

The haphazard way in which these conversions took place, as well as the lack of official documents on them, make it unclear how many LVT(A)(4)s were converted. The lack of available spares for their automotive components makes it unlikely that they were used for long, and it is likely they were withdrawn from frontline use as soon as Soviet deliveries of tanks and armoured vehicles started in the early 1950s.
