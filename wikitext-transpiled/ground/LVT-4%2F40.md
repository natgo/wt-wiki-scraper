== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Direct Hit"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season V, "River Hunter"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

With weak armour that can be penetrated by heavy machine gun fire, any vehicle could suddenly spray bullets and knock out some crew members. The armour is useful against shrapnel and small calibre HE rounds. The poor armour is not crippling as the size and amount of crew members make up for the survivability as you will rarely be knocked out by a single AP shot, especially when fuses won't activate on the thin armour.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->

<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Has amphibious capability
- High rate of fire and very short reload time for the 40 mm cannon
- It has two 12.7 mm machine gun to complement the Bofors cannon
- Versatile, can be used as a light tank or a SPAA
- Large internal volume makes it remarkably survivable despite its thin armour

'''Cons:'''

- Gun depression only limit to -3 degrees
- Tall gun position with only -3 degrees gun depression, prone to close short range attacks
- Big profile makes easier for enemies to spot you
- Light armour and open-topped design make it vulnerable to air attacks, machine gun fire, chemical shells (HE, HEAT) and artillery strikes
- Fuel tanks exposed on the sides and prone to fire when shot

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In the wake of WWII, France possessed a large number of American vehicles in its service, including the LVT series of amphibious vehicles. These, along with other armored vehicles, were supplied to France as a short-term solution to rebuild the French military after the war. During the Indochina War of the early 1950's, LVTs in French service were modified to carry the 40 mm Bofors anti-air gun as it proved to be more effective against ground targets than the standard 37 mm cannon. These modified French LVTs also participated in the Suez Crisis of 1956, which also marked their final operational use.
