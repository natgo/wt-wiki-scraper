== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]]. 

This gun truck is a heavy 4×2 Lancia mounting the Obice da 100/17 model 1916 or Obice da 100/17 model 1914 howitzers. The Lancia 3Ro was picked simply because of its availability in military workshops in the Italian colony of Libya when Italian generals noted the urgent need for a quick armed vehicle to fight in the open terrain of the Desert. These workshops started converting a small batch of these vehicles to help satisfy this demand.

The models of the guns it carried (100/17) and the name of the truck (Lancia 3Ro) is what the Italian army based this SPGs name off. Several similar makeshift gun-mounted Lancia 3Ro's were built, but the models with 100/17 howitzers were among the most capable. Though the Lancia 3Ro was initially planned to be a repair and recon vehicle, equipment with these howitzers led to surprising performances in the anti-tank role<ref>Autocannone da 100/17 su Lancia 3Ro, Arturo Giusti, tanks encyclopedia, [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/autocannone-da-100-17-su-lancia-3ro/ <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Autocannone da 100/17 su Lancia 3Ro], June 15th 2022</ref>

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
This truck has basically no armour, this is its greatest weak point. The crew can be knocked out even by rifle-calibre machine guns because it is exposed. The truck is quite big, so it's an easy target for planes as well.

'''Armour type:'''

* Structural steel (cabin, chassis, gun mount)
* Wood (truck bed, ammo boxes)
* Wheel (tires)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The truck itself is quite light, and its mobility allows it to reach good spots in battle. The turning circle of the truck is big so it's not easy and fast to turn around in confined spaces.

{{main|Cannone da 100/17 Mod.1914 (100 mm)}}

The 100 mm Cannone da 100/17 Mod.1914 has a long reload time, traverse is slow. Because of the driver's cab, the gun depression is limited in that direction. Depending on the ammunition used, penetration and/or post-penetration damage is excellent for the vehicle's BR. The projectiles have a steep trajectory, as steep as the learning curve, especially in RB.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|Breda Mod. 38 (8 mm)}}

There is an 8 mm Breda Mod. 38 machine gun on the front of the vehicle. Since it can give away your position, it is best to use it as a weapon of last resort. Otherwise, it can be used against low-flying aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The best way to play the Lancia 3Ro (100/17) is to use it as a flanker and for surprise attacks. Due to the vehicle being wheeled, it is able to reach spots at the start of the match that many vehicles on the enemy team will not expect fire from. Good situational awareness and great map knowledge is needed to take full advantage of its mobility. Finding a good spot where it's not at risk of being cut down by MG fire will unlock the full potential of this vehicle.

The Lancia 3Ro is overall very weakly protected, so it's best to keep distance from enemy vehicles. Any machine gun fire, artillery strike, or air attack could put it out of combat. Note that the main armament of the vehicle does not have any depression when facing forward, so most likely the vehicle shows its side or back to the enemy. This is why it's best to find a good spot early in the match where advantage can be taken of the better qualities this vehicle has to offer. 

The secondary armament is an 8 mm Breda Mod. 38 machine gun at the front of the vehicle. This weapon is only useful against aircraft or other trucks, but it is the only line of defence when the main gun is loading. The player should memorize exit points in case their position is revealed, they are forced to retreat and relocate, especially considering the poor turning circle.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has access to HESH and HEAT rounds
* Fast speed on roads
* Can hide the driver's cab, improving chances of surviving an unfavourable encounter
* Large number of crew members

'''Cons:'''

* No armour
* Exposed ammo rack at the front
* Can be knocked out by rifle-calibre machine gun fire
* Not very good mobility off-road
* Big turning circle
* Slow gun traverse
* No gun depression when facing forward
* Slow muzzle velocity
* Angle limitation of Breda Mod. 38, pointing forward only

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The story of the Lancia 3Ro began during the mid-1930s, when Vincenzo Lancia started producing Ro trucks using Junkers diesel 2-cylinder 3.2L engines. In October 1937, the new 3Ro was introduced with a civilian variant (Serie 464) and a military variant (Serie 564). Deliveries began in 1938. It was very reliable and due to its performance on sandy terrain, it was given the nickname "Re del Deserto" (King of the Desert). Trucks captured by the British-led forces were kept in use. The Soviets also allegedly captured some for their own use, primarily because they were easy to maintain and also had great off-road mobility for a vehicle of its class.

The Raggruppamento Esplorante Corpo d'Armata di Manovra (in English: Mobile Army Corps Reconnaissance Battlegroup) or RECAM for short, began to plan out an easy and cheap method to give their side a stronger fighting chance by upgunning several Lancia 3Ro trucks with a Škoda 100/17 howitzer. The cannon originated from the First World War and was captured or given to Italy via reparations by Austria-Hungary. In Italian service, these guns would go under the name of Obice da 100/17. Although the gun was old, it still proved its worth, being able to fire a multitude of shells, including the Granata da 100 Mod.32, Granata da 100 Mod.914, Effetto Pronto da 100, and Effetto Pronto mod.43. Interestingly enough, the Effetto Pronto da 100 was one of the first ever HESH-type munitions to ever be made and used in combat. 

The Škoda-built howitzers, both those that were captured or received as reparations from Austria-Hungary and refurbished during the 1920s and 1930s, as well as the improved, former Polish and Yugoslavian versions sold by Germany after Italy's entry into the war in 1940 (named Obice da 100/22 17 Mod. 14/19 in Italian service, and were mainly used by the CSIR of the Regio Esercito) would be used extensively around multiple Italian theatres. 

The first Lancia 3Ro (100/17) finished conversion in autumn of 1941 and saw combat with the 14th Autonomous Battery later that year. The vehicle used the Lancia Tipo 102 water-cooled engine which produced 93 HP at 1860rpm, allowing the vehicle to achieve a road speed of 30 to 45 km/h depending on the surface. It also had excellent off-road performance with a top speed between 15 and 30 km/h due to having a climbing capacity of 26 degrees and a 4-speed gearbox with reduction with 8 forward and 2 reverse gears. 

The vehicle was not armoured, and the crew exposed, which meant that as soon as an enemy had the vehicle in its sights, chances were that the Lancia 3Ro would not have lasted much longer. During the North African campaign, the vehicle saw use in many battles, such as the Battle of Marmatica. Sadly, however, the '''Autocannone da 100/17 su Lancia 3Ro''' was only produced in small numbers, by 1943, most units, if not all, would be wiped out. 

Some Lancia 3Ro's exist today, but in the civilian variant, displayed in museums or owned by private collectors.
