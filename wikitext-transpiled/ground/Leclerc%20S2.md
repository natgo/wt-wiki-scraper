== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Leclerc Séries 2''' is the second variant of the [[Leclerc (Family)|Leclerc main battle tank family]]. Nexter Systems designed and produced it with the ability to be deployed in desert regions. A total of 134 units of the [[Leclerc|Leclerc Séries 1]] were produced for service before being replaced on the assembly line in 1997 by the Leclerc Séries 2, which primarily features a hybrid air conditioner to cool the computer system as well as an independent air conditioning unit installed on the back roof behind the gunner's hatch. Other enhancements include an additional splash guard added to the front hull, a remote-operated hydraulic track tensioner, bolt-on appliqué armour on each hull sponson, and the replacement of the Athos thermal imaging equipment on the gunner's sight with the new Iris thermal imaging equipment. A total of 176 units were manufactured.

Introduced in [[Update "New Power"]], the Leclerc Séries 2 is almost identical to the Leclerc Séries 1, apart from a few improvements, such as a new nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protective system and air conditioner, which are not reflected in the game. With its high mobility and autoloader, the Leclerc Séries 2 may play a variety of roles on the battlefield. Its mobility allows it to get into advantageous positions for sniping or ambushing, and the autoloader allows for quick responses and follow-up shots against enemies. Its survivability is best when hull down from a hill, as most of its vulnerable areas, except the tank gun breech, are effectively hidden. Avoid close-range combat because the numerous hull weak points are visible and targetable in urban environments.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Leclerc S2 is virtually the same inside as the S1, excluding a few upgrades not functional in-game, such as a new NBC protection system and air conditioner. The turret cheeks (>600 mm KE) are well protected, with the middle glacis plate providing 720 mm chemical and 550 mm kinetic protection. The flat plate below the gunner's thermal optic provides 500 mm of protection against KE.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=2,325|rbMinHp=1,327}}

The Leclerc S2 is powered by the same engine as the S1, the Wärtsilä V8X-1500. Outputting 1,500 hp and using a special gas turbine turbocharger (which can also act as the vehicle's APU, and eliminating turbo lag), the Leclerc S2 has great mobility for its class at 26.69 hp/ton. However, it weighs 2.5t more than the S1, which makes for noticeable sluggishness without engine upgrades.

{{main|GIAT CN120-26 F1 (120 mm)}}

Like its predecessor, the Leclerc S2 is equipped with the CN120-26 F1 L/52 cannon. It can fire three shells: a stock HEATFS round, and two APFSDS shells. The OFL 120 F1, which shares the same penetrator as the DM43, slices through over 550 mm of armour past 1 km. Although this isn't as competitive as some contemporaries, it still performs very well against enemy MBTs. The 120 F1 shell also has a velocity of 1,790 m/s which makes for very good ballistics and low bullet drop. Although powerful, the 120 F1 round is a Tier IV modification; like most other MBTs, the Leclerc starts out with a stock HEATFS shell. Although powerful against light vehicles and SPAA, the HEATFS is redundant against your opponents. You have an APFSDS shell as a Tier I modification, however, one must note that it penetrates only 425 mm of armour even at close range.

Unlike most of its Western contemporaries (excluding the [[Type 90]] and the [[CV 90120]]), the Leclerc S2 is equipped with an autoloader. This gives it a steady rate of fire of 6 seconds, tied with an aced crew level of the M1A2 Abrams and the Leopard 2. This gives it great follow-up shot potential out of the box without the need for crew upgrading. Also equipped with powerful thermals for the gunner, the Leclerc can pick off unsuspecting targets with great efficiency.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
With great mobility and an autoloading 120 mm cannon, the Leclerc can be exploited to fulfil a number of roles on the battlefield. Mobility enables it to get into competitive spots for sniping or ambushing, and the gun's performance enables quick response and follow-up shots to any enemy that appears. Its survivability is best while hull down or poking out from a hill, as most of its vulnerable areas excluding the cannon breech (and sometimes the LFP when poking out from cover) are hidden well enough. Try to avoid close quarters combat (CQC) as the Leclerc's numerous hull weak spots can be easily seen and targeted in urban environments. If CQC is inevitable (i.e. Rhine, Sweden, Novorossiysk), then the Leclerc can be used to ambush distracted tanks and poke out of cover. When shot at or damaged, use your smoke grenades to retreat into cover. 14 smoke grenades give two separate discharges, or if discharged all at once, provide 360 degrees of smoke for you to retreat behind.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The OFL 120 F1 APFSDS round is effective
* Autoloader allows for consistent reloads
* Competitive mobility and great reverse speed
* Has 2nd generation thermals for the gunner
* Large first-stage ammo stowage
* Lower profile compared to its contemporaries
* Relatively fast gun elevation/depression speeds

'''Cons:'''

* No thermal optics for commander
* Noticeable weak spots at close range or when not hull down
* Cannon breech is easy to hit at any range
* 10 mm armour protection for the engine: 12.7 mm rounds can set afire and immobilize you
* Only three crew members
* Abysmal performance when stock
* Heavier than the Leclerc S1 - slightly reduced mobility and acceleration
* The mantlet can easily be penetrated, even by lower tier guns and at distance - the mantlet is hard to hide
* Lower frontal plate does not have any composites, meaning a penetration on the front is mostly incapacitating or downright lethal
* Slower than average turret traverse rate

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Leclerc Série 2 Tranche 6 was the 9th version of the Leclerc (counting prototypes) which had minor improvements compared to the previous Leclerc Série 1 Tranche 2-5. It featured an increase on the commander's optic periscope armour to STANAG 3. An air conditioner was added, as well as lockable baskets and boxes on the turret's bustle. A wave deflector was added at the frontal plate, as well as addition of one piece rubber plating on side skirts. Later models of the S2, more specifically the Leclerc S2T9, were retrofitted with V5 tracks instead of V2 tracks as well as a new General Purpose Sight (gunner's optics) at the end of their life service in order to standardise them for further Leclerc Série 3 also known as SXXI.
