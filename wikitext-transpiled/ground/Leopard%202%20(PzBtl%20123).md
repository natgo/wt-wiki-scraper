== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull sides, rear, and roof, turret sides, rear, and roof)
* High hardness rolled armour (hull front, turret front, gun mantlet)
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet frame)
* Composite screen (front side skirts)
* Structural steel (rear side skirts)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels, tracks, and torsion bars are 20 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The mobility of this vehicle is very good. It can usually travel 30-40 MPH (48-64 KPH) on level, flat ground and the down-slopes of hills. Otherwise, its mobility can range from 20-35 MPH (32-56 KPH) on rough terrain and the up-slopes of hills. It can go approximately 20 MPH backwards. It is very manoeuvrable and can make sharp turns easily.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 2 is a first stage ammo rack located within a blow-out containment
* It totals 15 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank and emptied first when firing.
* If you pack 16&nbsp;''(+26)'' shells, it will keep the hull empty of ammo.
* Full reload speed will occur as long as shells are available in the ready rack 2. If the ready rack is empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into rack 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Because the PzBtl 123 is fast, it is good for flanking attacks. If you can manage to get around the enemy undetected, then you can destroy them with your superior armament. Heavy tanks and any vehicle carrying APFSDS shells are a huge menace to the survivability of the vehicle. If you choose to go into frontal combat instead of flanking, you should pop out of cover, fire an APFSDS (DM23 is better than DM13) at an enemy tank's lower armour in the front, and then retreat to cover as quickly as possible. If you do not, a heavy tank may one shot you or a light tank could take out your driver, gunner and commander, and the loader. Be especially wary of other medium tanks that are also trying to flank your team, because chances are, they also have a 120 mm gun and can one shot you with a well placed round.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 120 mm L/44 cannon
** Good assortment of ammunition, especially DM23 APFSDS, for dealing with wide variety of enemy threats
** High-velocity rounds coupled with good sight magnifications make long-range fighting viable
* Turret armour is sufficient for hull-down tactics and fighting style
* Blow out panels available if certain ammo racks are detonated
* Gunner thermal sights makes target acquisition easier
* Default camo netting can assist with concealment in realistic/simulator battles

'''Cons:'''

* Hull armour is weak and proves vulnerable against most enemy shells
* Weak points in turret (gun mantlet and gunner's optics) can cripple tank or entire crew quickly if enemy exploits them
* Crew arrangement means a frontal shot can potentially knock out driver, gunner and commander (3/4 crew members) with one shot
* If an APFSDS or HEATFS shell hits the inside of the track tread, the entire crew can be put out of commission very quickly
* Turret's strong points are still vulnerable to most top-ranking APFSDS shells available to the enemies
* Blow out panel-enabled ammo racks are small, carrying only 16 rounds
* Machine guns, both coaxial and pintle-mounted, are small calibre with restricted gun elevation that makes engaging and threatening air targets difficult
