== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* New [[s.MG.50 (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm s.MG.50]] coaxial machine gun instead of the [[MG3A1 (7.62 mm)|7.62 mm MG3A1 machine gun]] that's featured on all previous Leopard 2 tanks.
* The new engine (MTU MT 883 Ka-501) delivers 123,2 HP more and revs 400 RPMs higher than the older MTU MB 873 Ka-501 engine.
* Added protection from the new armor modules that are present on the turret, sides and on the hull.
* New hull design slightly increases protection.
* High-explosive shells have a harder time to overpressure because of the added armor modules on the hull.
* Has access to the DM11 which makes shooting down planes or helicopters easier.

'''Cons:'''

* The new armor modules increase the weight drastically.
* Features the older 120 mm Rh L/44 cannon with less penetration than the 120 mm Rh L/55 cannon that's on the Leopard 2A6.
* The tank is bigger and wider than the other Leopard 2 variants which makes it difficult to find well protected spots.
* The same 1st Gen Thermal imager for the gunner.
* The hull can still be penetrated easily with APFSDS rounds.
* Huge hull ammo rack that can be shot easily, just like on the other Leopard 2 variants.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Leopard 2 PSO, with PSO standing for "Peace Support Operations", was KMW's proactive development of the Bundeswehr's requirements for a tank that needed to be adapted for urban warfare peacekeeping operations. As a result of this version, the Leopard 2 PSO features a compact Euro-Powerpack engine, and has been equipped with optional equipment, capable of being fitted for whatever mission is at hand. The Leopard 2 PSO's hull has been equipped with additional armor modules on the sides and on the turret, as well as reinforced underbody protection. The modernization of Leopard 2 tanks under the PSO program was first delayed and then eventually abandoned in favor of upgrading tanks to the Leopard 2A7 specification.
