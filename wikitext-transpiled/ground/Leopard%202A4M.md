== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Leopard 2A4M is an upgraded variant of the well known 2A4 found in many nations tech trees. The 2A4M is protected by an upgraded composite armour layout on the front of its turret, capable of protecting the tank from many rounds found at its BR. The upper front plate also has some extra protection against chemical munitions, and some KE projectiles at its tier. The sides of the turret and hull of the 2A4M are covered by composite screens that provide good protection against chemical energy threats, but will most likely not stop any KE rounds that make contact with them. Even with all the added armour, any projectile that penetrates the left side from the front of the tank will almost always knock out the driver, gunner, and commander leading to a crew knock out. The added turret face armour still has the common weak spots of all 2A4s such as the gunner sight, mantlet, and turret ring, which will knock out the gun and/or kill the gunner and commander (sometimes even the loader causing a crew knockout) causing the player to be unable to return fire. If the player decides to carry more than 16 pieces of ammo, it will begin to fill the hull ammo storage which is not protected by blowout panels, causing most penetrations here to ammo rack the tank, destroying it instantly.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|Rh120 L/44 (120 mm)}}

The shorter Rheinmetall L/44 120 mm cannon is retained for the upgraded 2A4M, borrowing the American export KE-W for its top round. The 2A4M also has DM12A1 and DM33 available to it, with all rounds available upon purchase. The KE-W round has superior penetrating performance over most MBTs' top rounds at its BR, which gives it an edge in peer-to-peer tank duels. DM12A1 can be brought to deal with lighter targets more efficiently than KE-W. DM33 can be brought over KE-W for its post-penetration damage due to the heavier weight at the cost of a significant amount of penetration.

{{main|C6 (7.62 mm)}}

The Leopard 2A4M is equipped with one pintle-mounted machine gun and one coaxial machine gun, both 7.62 mm C6 light machine guns. These can be used as an anti-air deterrent (shooting at planes, helicopters, or drones) or for clearing out light obstacles and crew from open vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Similar to the Leopard 2 PSO, the Leopard 2A4M has added armour over the base 2A4, increasing its survivability substantially, which helps it take more aggressive positions or push dug-in positions more easily. However, it can feel sluggish with the add-on armour, so it is recommended to remove the "mine protection" and "slat armour" modules to lower the weight of the vehicle and increase its mobility.

Despite retaining the older 120 mm L/44 cannon, it is still great at destroying any vehicles with its competitive KE-W round. This makes it an excellent sniper at any range with its 3rd generation thermals and laser rangefinder. Coupled with the Leopard 2's great mobility, this allows it to do berm drills when behind a hill with ease while surviving some return fire due to the uparmored turret.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to 3rd generation thermals for both gunner and commander
* Uses KE-W which has better performance over DM43 in the 120 mm L/44
* Uparmoured turret can defeat KE threats with ~600 mm penetration, added side armour easily deflects autocannon rounds if angled
* Removing armour slats and mine protection gives it greater mobility over uparmoured Leopard 2 variants
* Camouflage net breaks up silhouette slightly at distance

'''Cons:'''

* Retains gunner's optic, gun breach, and turret ring weakspots of the Leopard 2A4
* Hull isn't uparmoured at the front which is easily defeated at its BR
* Unprotected ammo rack at the front hull which can detonate when loaded
* Full mine and slat protection provides only a marginal amount of protection while hampering its mobility
* Lacks timed HE, proximity-fused rounds, or a medium-calibre machine gun to defeat low-flying air threats
* Camouflage net almost completely blocks painted camouflage which can make it stand out in certain environments

The Leopard 2A4M CAN modification was developed to modernize 20 Canadian Army Leopard 2A4 tanks for use in combat operations in Afghanistan. They were equipped with additional composite armor packages, placed to protect the front and sides of the turret and hull, plus slat armor at the back of the turret and around the engine compartment to help protect against shaped charge ammunition. In addition to this, the fire control system was modernized with a brand-new thermal imager and commander sight. Due to the extra armor, the weight of the tank increased, which meant that the brakes and suspension were modified as well. Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) developed this modification and by 2010 all 20 tanks were modernized. Between 2010 and 2011, 5 Leopard 2A4M CAN tanks were deployed in Afghanistan.
