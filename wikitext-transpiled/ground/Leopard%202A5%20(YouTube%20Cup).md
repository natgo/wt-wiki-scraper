The Leopard 2A5, a formidable main battle tank, emerged as the pinnacle of German engineering and design in the late 20th century. Introduced in 1995 as an advanced iteration of the Leopard 2 family, the 2A5 showcased its prowess during the 21st-century conflicts. This tank's innovative features, including modular composite armour enhancements and advanced fire control systems, made it a stalwart on the battlefield. Its baptism of fire came in the early 2000s, notably during NATO's involvement in Afghanistan. With its powerful Rheinmetall 120 mm smoothbore gun, the Leopard 2A5 could accurately engage targets at extended ranges, solidifying its reputation as a precision weapon. Its capabilities were further demonstrated during Operation Iraqi Freedom, where it played a pivotal role in coalition forces. A combination of cutting-edge technology, unmatched firepower, and adaptability ensured the Leopard 2A5's enduring legacy, making it a symbol of armoured supremacy well into the 21st century.

The {{Specs|pseudonym}} was introduced during [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]] as a grand prize for the [[wt:en/news/6286-esport-war-thunder-youtube-cup-results-en|2019 YouTube Cup]]. The Leopard 2A5's exceptional mobility and robust powerplant further enhance its capability to swiftly manoeuvre on the battlefield, enabling it to quickly identify and engage enemy targets. Whether facing contemporary adversaries like the Russian [[T-90A|T-90]] or older models like the [[T-72 (Family)|T-72]], the Leopard 2A5's exceptional combination of armour, firepower, and manoeuvrability cements its position as a dominant force in tank-to-tank combat, reaffirming its status as a pre-eminent mainstay in modern armoured warfare.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Leopard 2A5's armour represents a pinnacle of armour, which provides exceptional protection against a wide spectrum of threats encountered on the battlefield. Its modular composite armour system  configuration optimizes the tank's resistance to various types of projectiles, dispersing and dissipating their energy upon impact. The tank's turret and hull are heavily armoured, with extra emphasis on critical areas like the frontal arc. The Leopard 2A5's turret spaced armour design further enhances its survivability. By creating air gaps between armour layers, the tank can disrupt the penetration capabilities of shaped-charge warheads, such as those found on anti-tank guided missiles. This design concept effectively minimizes the impact of these threats, providing an additional layer of defense against them. Blowout panels in the Leopard 2A5 serve as critical safety features designed to mitigate the potential catastrophic consequences of an ammunition detonation within the tank. These panels are positioned on the turret, surrounding the ammunition storage compartments. In the unfortunate event of an internal explosion, often triggered by enemy fire or other factors, the blowout panels are able to rapidly release the high-pressure gases and energy away from the crew compartment.

In the realm of armoured combat, the Leopard 2A5 emerges as a paragon of tactical ingenuity, harmonizing cutting-edge technology with strategic finesse. This formidable main battle tank showcases its prowess through a dynamic symphony of tactics. Adopting an ambush approach with its superb mobility, the Leopard 2A5 capitalizes on its lethal firepower and precision, lying in wait within concealed terrain before swiftly shifting positions to confound adversaries. The Leopard 2A5 seamlessly integrates the concept of hull-down defense. By leveraging its robust armour and taking advantage of natural cover, the tank presents only its turret to the enemy while maintaining its potent offensive capabilities. This tactic not only magnifies protection but ensures that the tank remains a relentless and unyielding force on the battlefield. With a prowess akin to a predator, the Leopard 2A5 embraces flank and rear attacks as a means to exploit its exceptional mobility. Executing lightning-quick manoeuvres, it manoeuvres to the peripheries of the battlefield, exposing enemy tanks to its voracious appetite for destruction. Through these cunning manoeuvres, the tank preys on unsuspecting opponents, targeting their weaker armour and flanks, thus dismantling the enemy team.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent 120 mm gun, DM53 APFSDS is capable of penetrating up to 623 mm maximum at point-blank range
* Impenetrable turret cheeks, the add-on wedge armour makes the turret immune from every shell in the game (average of 850 mm against long rod APFSDS and 1,450 mm against HEAT)
* Good armour on the UFP (430 mm against APFSDS), immune to older shells; though many top-tier tanks possess shells which can go straight through
* Great gun handling: 40°/s turret rotation speed (with Ace crew) and -9°/+20° of vertical guidance
* Side turret covered by add-on armour can bounce early APFSDS shells
* Gunner optics are now mounted on top of the turret, removing the annoying weak spot present on the Leopard 2A4
* Cannon barrel and cannon breech absorbs impact rounds which may otherwise penetrate the turret and injure crews
* Gun breech and mantlet has a smaller profile than other western MBTs
* Good thermal imaging quality (Generation 2 for Binoculars, 800 x 600, and Generation 1 for Gunner's view, 500 x 300)

'''Cons:'''

* Lower glacis can still be penetrated by most shells (but is expected for most MBTs)
* 16 shells in the ready-rack may be insufficient when playing in Arcade Battles
* If your turret ammo rack is shot, you might survive but then you lose all your unloaded ammo storage
* Huge hull ammo-rack if more than 16 shells are carried consequently making the tank extremely vulnerable to HE shells
* A penetrating shot on the left side of the hull will most likely knock out the driver, gunner and commander, thus destroying the tank
* A penetrating shell on the right side of the hull will most likely hit the ammo-rack, destroying the tank
* Just like all Leopard series, raised engine deck means less gun depression when the turret is facing the rear
* The wedges can be shot off with several hits, though the turret cheeks alone provide 650 mm against KE
* Tank's weight is 4 tons increased while the engine is still the same, making the {{PAGENAME}} slower compared to the 2A4
* Despite all the added armour, the turret ring and driver's hatch are both easily penetrated, and the enemy will most likely aim at these two spots to disable or destroy the tank
* Is outperformed by its successor, the Leopard 2A6, in terms of firepower. The longer L/55 cannon on the Leopard 2A6 increases the performance of both DM33 and DM53 shells.
