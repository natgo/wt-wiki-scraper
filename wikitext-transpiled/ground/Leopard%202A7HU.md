== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Hungarian medium tank {{Battle-rating}} in the Italian research tree. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]] as part of the Hungarian branch of the Italian tech tree.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Marvelous penetration with the DM53 round
* Upgraded armour making the tank hard to kill from the front
* Excellent reverse and forward speed
* Has access to Gen 3 thermals for the commander and gunner unlike previous Leopards
* Perfect gun handling for an MBT: 40°/s for both turret rotation and gun elevation speed (with ace crew) and -9°/+20° maximum vertical guidance
* Access to a top mounted .50 cal machine gun
* Access to HE-TF round that can deal with lightly armoured targets
* Access to spall liners that increase survivability
* Quite survivable tank with a lot of space between each modules and crew members

'''Cons:'''

* The turret armour can be shot off making the tank more vulnerable
* Turret ring and mantlet are still a huge weak spot, despite the added armour
* 12.7 turret is quite large. Makes the tank easier to spot and kill with large caliber HE
* Engine deck prevents from lowering the gun enough towards the back
* Mine protection adds a lot of weight and decrease the mobility compared to a standard Leopard 2A7V
