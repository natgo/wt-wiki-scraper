== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]].

Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

The Leopard 2A7V has access to the DM53 APFSDS, a high penetrating APFSDS shell. Such a shell is able to penetrate the [[M1A2 Abrams]], the [[Challenger 2]], and the [[T-80U]] more easily than its predecessor.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* A very well-armoured MBT with even fewer weak spots (UFP)
* Deadly firepower, incredibly powerful DM53 APFSDS round
* Gen 3 thermals
* Spall liners in turret & hull armour
* Extremely good gun handling for an MBT: 40°/s for both turret rotation and gun elevation speed (with Ace crew) and -9°/+20° of maximum vertical guidance
* Cannon barrel and cannon breech can absorb impact rounds which may otherwise penetrate the turret and injure crew members
* Has access to the DM11 HE-TF round

'''Cons:'''

* Decent mobility, but inferior to its predecessors
* Lower frontal plate is weak and relatively huge, most penetrations from here are deadly
* Huge hull ammo rack that can be shot easily, just like on the other Leopard 2 variants, if more than 16 shells are carried makes the tank vulnerable to HE shells and presents an annoying hull weak spot
* Hull penetrations are likely fatal; a penetrating shot on the left side of the hull will most likely knock out the driver, gunner and commander, while a penetrating shell on the right side of the hull will most likely hit the ammo-rack, in both cases destroying the tank
* The wedges can be shot off with several hits, though the turret cheeks alone provide armour against KE projectiles
* Despite all the added armour, the turret ring and the mantlet are both easily penetrated, and the enemy will most likely aim at these two spots to disable or destroy the tank

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In the mid 2010s, the German government backtracked on plans to reduce the size of the armoured force in the Bundeswehr. Instead, a plan was formulated with Krauss-Maffei-Wegmann, the manufacturer of the Leopard 2 MBT, to produce additional vehicles under a new and improved standard.

The Leopard 2A7V, as it became known, featured improved protection thanks to a modular armour package bolted on the front of the hull as well as improved optics and a new transmission adapted to the increased weight. The new vehicle was officially presented in October 2019 and entered service with the Bundeswehr in September 2021. Presently, all 104 Leopard 2A7Vs ordered by Germany are in active service with the Bundeswehr.
