== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a French prototype for a new self-propelled artillery piece, developed after WWII with the intent of providing France with a domestic artillery system. The prototypes were finished in the 1950s but never reached production. The vehicle was equipped with the Obusier de 155 mm Modèle 50 alongside a roof-mounted 20 mm autocannon for anti-aircraft defence. A new project emerged in the early 1950s, the Batignolles Chatillon 155 mm. The Lorraine 155 mm project was deemed to be redundant and all work on the project was discontinued.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 "Advancing Storm"]] as a reward during the [[wt:en/news/5453-special-chronicles-of-world-war-ii-in-war-thunder-en|2018 WW2 Chronicles]]. The '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''' is a very interesting self propelled artillery, featuring a 155 mm Howitzer at a relatively low BR, alongside a 20 mm autocannon that can be used to some extent against enemy tanks, but is especially useful against enemy aircraft. The biggest issue with this vehicle is the ability to be easily overpressured by enemy HE shells and the slow reload, with 20 seconds minimum using an aced crew.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} has very little armour (although some are sloped enough to deflect certain low-calibre rounds), and can generally be penetrated by most guns of its rank. Even worse, however, the 'casemate' (if it can even be called that) has very little armour, and in some places can be shot through with machine guns. The machine-gunner (operating the 20 mm gun) is completely standing in the open. Generally, you want to rely on good map placement and mobility, rather than armour.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, superstructure)
* Wheel (tires)
* Structural steel (gun mount, gun breech, mudguards)

'''Notes:'''

* Projectiles and propellant charges are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* The visual discrepancy concerns the total number of shells as well as the number of shells per rack:
** 28 shells are modeled but you can pack 30 shells.
** Rack 8 is modeled as 3 shells but contains 5 shells.
* Recommended loadout: 9&nbsp;''(+21)'' shells. It keeps most ammunition in the floor and out of sponsons.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

The roof-mounted MG 151 autocannon is very good at knocking out tracks, punching through lightly armoured vehicles and shooting down low-flying aircraft. Use it sparsely because of its low ammo count. When losing a crew member, the machine gunner is used to replace other crew members, meaning that you can't use the 20 mm cannon anymore.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The best method of using the large-calibre weapon on the Lorraine is to exploit the high-explosive power against thin-armour on the enemy. Like other large calibre HE tanks, shooting below an enemy vehicle will penetrate its belly armour. This is an effective, albeit difficult way to engage tanks whose armour is greater than what your HE shell can penetrate.

Some targets to keep in mind of, and their weak points:

* Tiger I - While seemingly a hard enemy to face, the Tiger is easily dispatched with a side shot. A hit to the roadwheels will penetrate the tank, with the shell fragments going through the thin armour on the underside of the tank's sponson. This is also possible to do to Tiger IIs, but usually results in much less damage done.
* Tiger II P, Panthers D and A - a hit to the bottom of the curved turret face of these tanks will cause the HE shell to penetrate the roof of the vehicle. This can also be done on tanks with flat turret fronts ( Tiger I, Tiger II H, Panthers G and F) by aiming for the lower half of the turret, but is not as reliable.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 155 mm gun with a HE shell on-par with the KV-2's gun
* Pintle-mounted 20 mm cannon that is deadly to lightly-armoured vehicles and aircraft
* Decent mobility
* Good reverse speed

'''Cons:'''

* Thin armour with an open casemate, allows even rifle-calibre rounds to affect the crew
* Despite thin armour, it's thick enough to trigger most fuses in APHE shells
* Large profile
* Long reload time; increases if the loader is taken out
* If the machine-gunner is knocked out, so is the ability to use the 20 mm cannon
* No AP shells, only HE shells
* Bad gun depression of 5°

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Prototypes of the Lorraine 155 Mle.50 passed trials in 1950, but never reached production.
