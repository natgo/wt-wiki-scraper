== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]].

==== Ammunition ====
The armour-piercing capped round Mle 1936 has a high penetration power for the battle rating but lacks the post-penetration damage with the absence of an explosive filler. The lack of base tracer also makes it difficult to correct your targeting at long distance as you can't properly visualize the trajectory of your shell.

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Combat tactics

Virtually unarmoured, the {{PAGENAME}} is better used to snipe or ambush the enemy. Its gun has a good rate of fire, but many other guns at this rank will reload as fast as yours. The gun is extremely powerful for its rank, which means you will penetrate almost any target, so there is no need to throw yourself in front of the enemy: position yourself at a safe distance from the frontline action. An open-backed SPG should never be flanked: put at least 500 m between you and your target and watch your sides for sneaking foes. While the gun can be sufficient to destroy most enemies in a single shot, more heavily armoured enemies will need several well-aimed shots to be fully disabled. The gun's ballistics are somewhat tricky without a base tracer and the ammo count is limited, so aim carefully and accurately.
At the start of the match, use your good mobility to get to a location overlooking enemy movement routes or a sniping spot to engage advancing enemy vehicles. Make sure to change your position every few shots to prevent enemies from tracking you down and targeting you with either artillery strikes or close air support attacks. Even light machine gun fire is a big threat as most of your crew members sit in the open: planes are very dangerous with the {{PAGENAME}} having no anti-aircraft armament to counter them. Therefore, it is best to remain hidden or behind cover.

;Notable enemies

With its thin armour, any enemy can knock out the {{PAGENAME}} with prolonged light MG fire. But some stand out by the danger they pose:

* Tanks and tank destroyers firing HEAT shells: LVT(A)(4), M8 Scott, Pz.IV C, Nb.Fz., 15cm sIG 33 B Sfl, Sd.Kfz. 234/3, Ho-Ro, Chi-Ha Short Gun, M8 HMC (China) and Spj fm/43-44.
* Fast-firing light tanks which can shower you continuously with bullets: M2A2, Pz.II C, Pz.II C (DAK), Pz.II F, Sd.Kfz.234/1, T-60, AB 41, L3/33 CC, L6/40, AMD.35 and AMR.35 ZT3.
* Fast-firing SPAA vehicles which can shower you continuously with bullets: M13 MGMC, Flakpanzer I, GAZ-AAA (DShK), GAZ-AAA (4M), Light AA Mk I, Type 94, Ta-Se, AS42, P7T AA and Pvlvv fm/42.

;How to defeat a {{PAGENAME}}

* Do not attack the tank destroyer frontally as it will most likely hit you first.
* If alone, flanking the {{PAGENAME}} undetected and immobilizing it with your first shot remains your best chance to destroy it. But it is difficult because it will position very far from the frontline.
* Initiate a pincer move on it together with a teammate. As a turretless tank destroyer with weak armour, this will force it to retreat and relocate or face the  risk of being destroyed.
* If you have no other option than to attack the {{PAGENAME}} frontally, blind it with smoke before closing the gap or force it out of position with indirect fire (artillery strikes).

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very good penetration for a 47 mm at this rank
* Excellent post-penetration damage even without HE filler, much improved over the 47 mm SA35 common to other French tanks
* Fast firing cannon
* Very good gun depression and traverse arc
* The projectile does not have any tracer component in its rounds; enemy players cannot deduce your position from the round's trajectory

'''Cons:'''

* The side and rear of the vehicle have very little armour, leaving three of the four crew members with almost no protection from artillery and incoming fire
* Mid and long-range shots difficult to correct without any tracer component in the round to visually track the round's trajectory

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== [[wt:en/news/6899-development-lorraine-37l-antichar-anti-tank-tractor-en|Devblog]] ===
During the German invasion of France in mid 1940, the French army suffered heavy losses, especially when it came to its armoured vehicles. As a result, several urgent attempts were made to create improvised combat vehicles from resources available to French engineers in order to bolster the strength of the army, which faced a seemingly unstoppable invasion.

One of these projects was the conversion of the Lorraine 37L tractor into a tank destroyer by fitting it with a 47 mm SA37 anti-tank gun. The conversion took little time, with the prototype being ready in just a few weeks, however by the time construction was completed, France had already fallen. As a result, the prototype never saw combat action and was instead captured by German forces following the occupation.
