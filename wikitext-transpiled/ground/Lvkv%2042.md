== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
'''{{Specs|name}}''' (English: ''anti air cannon wagon 42''), or '''lvkv 42''' for short, is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]]. Number 42 in its name indicates that it is the second "lvkv"-SPAA that uses 40 mm weaponry (4 = 40 mm, 2 = 2nd).

The lvkv 42 was developed by the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors on request from the Swedish army as a 1950s next generation Swedish SPAA following the 1940s limited production lvkv fm/43 SPAA. Two prototypes based on a new original chassis-design were built and delivered for testing late December 1953 and early January 1954 respectively after various delays. In the end the project was scrapped as SPAAs with integrated radars became more necessary.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.''

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good penetration, excellent Swedish 40 mm performance can make quick work of enemy light tanks as well as medium units if utilized correctly!
* Very fast turret traverse and elevation rate (can reach 70°/s with an aced crew)
* Stock belt alternates between AP and HE every other round, making it a very effective all-purpose belt
* 240 RPM, only the Ostwind and AMX-13 DCA 40 is on par with the fire rate
* Very nimble, its agility can get you safely around the battlefield

'''Cons:'''

* Paper thin armour, very easy to be disabled or entirely knocked out by incoming HMG fire
* Low ammo storage, quickly runs out of ammunition when engaging several threats
* Along with the poor armour, the turret crew's heads are visible - making them easy targets for enemy machine gun fire
* SAPHEI belt has lower penetration than the HE and stock belts, but has more post-penetration damage

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
