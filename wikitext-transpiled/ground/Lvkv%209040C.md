== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]]. Its name translates directly to "Air Defense Cannon Carriage/Wagon".

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is best considered to be non-existent. This turns out to work to its benefit however, as the lack of armour can often prevent the vehicle from being outright destroyed upon a first strike, leaving the player a few seconds to retaliate. The turret, hull, and front upper plate all boast a few mm of composite armour which does help against smaller caliber machine guns, however you are still very vulnerable to enemy CAS, IFVs, and MBTs. 

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: *Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Cupola roof)
* Composite screen (Hull front, Hull sides, Turret front)

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Capable at destroying jets with its fused HE and tanks with its APFSDS
* A [[Strf 9040C|Stridsfordon 90C]] with radar and lock-on ability to engage jets and helicopters at longer distances
* Very well protected SPAA
* Not limited to AA role and can flank and destroy tanks easily thanks to its 40 mm APFSDS
* Good mobility
* Low profile unlike other SPAAs
* Access to second generation thermals for the gunner
* Good gun elevation, higher than the [[Lvrbv 701]]

'''Cons:'''

* Due to its limited magazine (only 24 shells) it can not engage multiple targets without emptying the magazine
* When the magazine is emptied, it takes time to reload - holding down the trigger is not recommended. Fire in short bursts to avoid spooking the pilot/tanker and conserve ammunition
* While reloading the magazine it will be an easy prey for enemy air units
* The HE-VT shell is a tier II modification
* The stock HE shell needs a direct hit on an aerial vehicle to destroy it - smart pilots know not to fly in a straight line, making it very difficult to take them down
* Doesn't have SAMs so can't engage helicopters at long ranges
* An easy target for enemy helicopters with long range Vikhr and Hellfire ATGMs
* Does not get access to the scouting abilities the Strf 9040C and [[Strf 9040 BILL]] have
* Rather slow turret traverse
* No CITV
* 40 mm HE-VT is rather weak - multiple hits are required to down an enemy aircraft
* 40 mm HE-VT needs to travel a certain distance to activate the fuse - helicopters at close range require a direct hit to take down

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
