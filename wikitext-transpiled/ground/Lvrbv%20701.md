== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a Swedish self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle equipped with a short-range [[Rbs 70]] surface-to-air missile system designed and built by Bofors, up to 5km range depending on the weather conditions due to the missile being guided by the operator. The {{PAGENAME}} were developed alongside the [[Pvrbv 551]] using the same chassis built on the Ikv 102 and [[Ikv 103]] chassis that were decommissioned but the {{PAGENAME}} were only built on leftover [[Ikv 103]] and were given a new purpose. Both {{PAGENAME}} and [[Pvrbv 551]] share similar production history, only noticeable difference is the armarments with the {{PAGENAME}} being an anti-air unit. Sharing also similar issues as the [[Pvrbv 551]] with an underpowered engine, making it sluggish off-road. A total of 48 units were built in early 1980's and wouldn't be delivered until between 1984 to 1986 they were used in limited service for the anti-air companies throughout their use in the Swedish service. The vehicle were decommissioned in the early 2000s.

Introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]], the lvrbv 701 is a special self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle with some capability to fight enemy ground vehicles. With the upgraded RB 70 Mark 2 surface-to-air missile's outstanding 200 mm armour penetration, this compact vehicle is capable of killing both lighter enemy ground targets and aircraft. Furthermore, the vehicle's low profile aids in stealth during engagements and allows players to hide behind low obstacles. However, the lvrbv 701 lacks a search radar, requiring players to manually locate enemy air targets with their eyes, resulting in low efficiency. Finally, due to the vehicle's limited elevation, players will have difficulty engaging hostile aircraft at high altitudes.

== General info ==
First to introduce the SAM gameplay to Sweden, the {{PAGENAME}} is a lightly armoured chassis identical to the [[Pvrbv 551]], both being based on the much older [[Ikv 103]]. The design is simply a man-portable RBS 70 missile system placed inside the refurbished chassis. Due to this structure, the {{PAGENAME}} features no radar to scan for incoming targets, and relies on a single missile salvo with a long interval between reloads. This, combined with bad traversal of the launcher, and low mobility, means that the {{PAGENAME}} is forced to engage carefully, as it has no proper way of defending itself outside of getting the first jump.

Though to list its strengths, the {{PAGENAME}} features a high agile and reliable missile system. The RB 70 is incredibly devastating to those that face it, as the SAM can easily damage unsuspecting enemy aircraft, since there is no radar to notify them of your presence. And thanks to the agility, the missile works comfortably at both closer and longer ranges.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Frontal armour on the {{PAGENAME}} consists of 20 to 25 mm of rolled homogeneous armour. Ideally, this can provide 28 to 30 mm of effective protection which should stop most low calibre machine gun fire, as well as .50 cal machine guns.

Side armour on the {{PAGENAME}} consists of 10 mm rolled homogeneous armour which, due to its limited angles, only affords protection against low calibre machine guns.

The turret has no armour whatsoever.

The crew of 4 consists of a driver, gunner, loader and commander all positioned closely together in the front half of the vehicle.

Overall, protection on the {{PAGENAME}} isn't spectacular and with a compact crew placement, including an exposed gunner, a simple burst of machine-gun fire from a .50 cal or larger fired at the sides or top can leave you knocked out. Its low profile and compact size does, however, work in your favour and lets you hide from most other ground vehicles and any aircraft/helicopters that haven't spotted you launching a missile.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

* Stay behind your team, but close to the front line
* Scout ground targets and repair allies
* Keep behind cover and focus on incoming planes
* Use smoke grenades when retreating
* Don't let opponents get above you

'''General'''

The {{PAGENAME}} is difficult to get used to, as the high BR ensures a punishing top-tier environment. Since the {{PAGENAME}} is meant for anti-air operation, the targets above you are usually easy pickings. The main threat for the {{PAGENAME}} is instead ground vehicles, as the tank has almost no way to defend itself against such opponents. The ideal way to play the vehicle is to stick close to your allied tanks, as they can deal with the ground threats for you, while you keep the airspace safe. The {{PAGENAME}} feature scouting, and can easily aid teammates that need information about enemy positions, or need to be repaired.

'''Engaging air targets'''

When the {{PAGENAME}} spots an air target, it's important to think about what you're engaging. Helicopters such as the [[Ka-50]], can easily see the missile coming, and are usually expecting some sort of retaliation for launching missiles away from the battlefield. A tip is not to attempt to lock such targets, and instead estimate the distance, and launch it when they're busy. When fighting helicopters at close range, such as the [[AH-1G]], or [[Mi-28N]], it is important to launch as soon as possible, and destroy them before they get above you, as you have no ability to destroy them at point-blank distance.

Aircraft are slightly more difficult to destroy, as the RB 70 missile lacks significant velocity compared to other systems. Instead, the manoeuvrability of the missile comes to a lot of help as planes will struggle to avoid it while manoeuvring. When first engaging an aircraft, knowing if it has RWR is critical, as aircraft aware of you might go for another pass or even worse strafe you from a blind spot. The missile works best when attacking at medium range, where the aircraft is either approaching or flying parallel to your position. Aircraft are usually easy to shoot down, but should always be engaged with consideration, as your reload leaves you vulnerable to counter-attacks from the same opponent.

{{Notice|The {{PAGENAME}} can be used to engage light vehicles, as the later missile has a lot of penetration. But engaging has to be done with caution due to the slow reload!}}

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* RB 70 Mk.2 missiles have 200 mm of penetration which can be useful against light ground targets
* Small vehicle profile allows you to hide behind cover effectively
* Unarmoured turret can help in reducing the visibility of the vehicle behind cover
* Smoke grenades can help when getting strafed by aircraft
* Upgraded RB 70 Mk.2 missiles are only a Tier II modification
* Can use the scouting mechanic to tag enemies and also help repair teammates

'''Cons:'''

* No secondary armament
* No search radar, only a tracking radar meaning you have to manually find targets
* Relatively sluggish turret rotation speed makes acquiring fast low flying targets difficult
* Only 200° total (±100°) of missile launcher rotation
* Max elevation of 35° makes tracking high altitude targets pretty much impossible
* Average mobility with very slow reverse speed
* Unarmoured turret leaves the gunner very vulnerable to knockouts

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

In 1983, the Swedish military gave a contract to Hägglunds and Söner to convert Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 vehicles into Lvrbv 701 surface-to-air missile carriers. The Ikv 102 and Ikv 103, infantry support vehicles mounting a 105 mm gun, had become obsolete in the past few years. At the same time, the same companies were contracted to convert Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 vehicles into Pvrbv 551 anti-tank missile carriers. The hull of the Ikv 102/Ikv 103 was plated over, in order to extend the crew compartment the full length of the vehicle. The engine was replaced by a Ford V-6 engine. The armament consisted of a RBS 70 surface-to-air missile launcher in the center of the hull, which was raised up through a circular opening in the roof of the vehicle - covered by a two piece hatch - in order to fire the weapon.
