== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (Armour plates over cab, sides and rear of flatbed, ammo bin covers)
- Wood (Flatbed)
- Structural steel (Remainder of vehicle)

|-

|-
|}

'''Notes:'''

- Wheels are 10 mm thick. Suspension frame is 30 mm thick.
- Turret base is 30 mm thick.
- Barrel is 20 mm thick.
- Gun is volumetric structural steel, 180-250 mm thick from the side and about a meter thick from the front.

The {{PAGENAME}} has essentially no armour from the side and only very minimal armour from the front. Three of the four crewmembers are located on the completely unarmoured turret, meaning machine guns can destroy the vehicle without having to shoot at the cab. The armour will not detonate most APHE rounds, but any HE or HEAT shell, artillery, machine gun, or autocannon will make quick work of the {{PAGENAME}}.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=199|rbMinHp=124}}

The {{PAGENAME}} does not have a particularly high top speed, especially for a wheeled vehicle, but it does have good acceleration. It is quick to accelerate both on and off roads, and has enough horsepower to climb hills with some effectiveness. While tough terrain such as snow and mud does slow it down, it remains effective. Turning performance is poor due to the vehicle's long wheelbase, but overall the {{PAGENAME}} is more than capable of manoeuvring effectively in combat and using its speed to flank the enemy.

{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

{{main|lvakan m/36 (40 mm)}}

The {{PAGENAME}}'s gun is a renamed Bofors 40 mm cannon, which is used on other AA guns such as the [[Crusader AA Mk I]] and the [[M19]]. The main difference is that the gun can fire {{Annotation|SAPHEI|semi armour-piercing high-explosive incendiary}} shells, which act like APHE, penetrating tanks and then exploding inside. These shells can be very effective against enemy vehicles, but do not have as much penetration as the standard AP shells. These shells can make the gun quite effective against light and even medium tanks at the {{PAGENAME}}'s tier, but the inaccuracy of the gun makes using them a challenge. At ranges beyond around 100 m it becomes difficult to hit weak spots reliably, even when firing the gun semi-auto. Automatic fire is rarely accurate enough to even land shots on target at this range. The gun has both high dispersion and recoil, which causes the unstable truck chassis it is mounted on to jiggle back and forth. Nevertheless, with trigger discipline and at closer ranges the gun can tear apart enemy tanks, especially from the side or rear.

==== Ammunition ====

- '''Default:''' {{Annotation|APC|Armour-piercing capped}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}} - This belt type works fine, although half of the shots (APC) in this belt is for fighting tanks, while the other half (HEFI-T) is for fighting planes. Use them if you don't know what you'll encounter.
- '''slsgr m/36C:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|APC|Armour-piercing capped}} - Versus planes and open combat compartment vehicles. Most planes will only take a few shots before going down.
- '''slhpgr m/43:''' {{Annotation|SAPHEI|Semi armour-piercing high-explosive incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|SAPHEI|Semi armour-piercing high-explosive incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|SAPHEI|Semi armour-piercing high-explosive incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}} - Best belt type to use against tanks. The SAPHEI shells have decent penetration and an explosive filler. It may be advisable to bring some default belts if the extra penetration is required.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

As any anti-aircraft vehicle, the {{PAGENAME}} is to be used against aerial targets to cover teammates from aerial attacks. The low fire rate of the 40 mm gun can make this task difficult, but one hit with the cannon's high-explosive shells should be sufficient in knocking down a plane from the skies.

Although being classified as an anti-air vehicle, one manner the {{PAGENAME}} can be used to great effect is as a tank destroyer. Due to the high penetration of the 40 mm AP shells, the {{PAGENAME}} can take advantage of most tanks having weak armour at its battle rating even frontally. However, caution is required as the gunner is exposed and the {{PAGENAME}} is not fast enough to be able to retreat once under attack.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Powerful 40 mm gun
- Effective in an anti-tank role
- AP shells have 79 mm of penetration
- SAPHEI shells have 66 mm of penetration and explosive filler
- 40 mm HE rounds make short work of enemy planes
- Very versatile - can take down both tanks and planes

'''Cons:'''

- Gun is inaccurate at longer ranges and when firing full-auto
- Slow turret traverse
- Hard to hit ground targets forward of the vehicle due to poor gun depression
- Not very agile due to it being on a truck chassis
- Four man crew of which three are in the open - susceptible to strafing enemy aircraft, artillery and machine gun fire
- Very little armour protection

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''
