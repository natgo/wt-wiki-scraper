== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Winged Lions"]].

The {{PAGENAME}} presents an armament upgrade over the M4 Sherman platform with a [[M-51 (105 mm)|105 mm gun]], as well as mobility upgrade with a Cummins diesel engine. However, compared to the [[M-51]] that uses a cast [[M4A1]] hull, the {{PAGENAME}} has a welded hull construction as it was built on a [[M4A3 (76) W|M4A3]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
While the Sherman had decent armour for its time, its armour will be penetrated by most enemies it will face at this rank. That's why you should adopt a playstyle similar to the [[Pz.IV F2]]: rely on your gun and mobility and keep distance between you and the enemy vehicles.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area, Cupola, MG port)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility is respectable. While the vehicle's top speed and acceleration lags behind contemporary vehicles, it can still allow the vehicle to perform in a somewhat-satisfactory manner as long as it is not expected to win races.

Reverse speed remains a common problem in the M4 Sherman platform, with the {{PAGENAME}} only able to reverse at -5 km/h. So when firing from a position, be aware of the reverse speed in order to afford the {{PAGENAME}} enough time to duck behind cover before enemy tanks can attack back, or instead push forward into cover to make the most of the forward speed available.

The most iconic feature of the {{PAGENAME}} is its large 105 mm M-51 gun, a variant of the French [[CN-105-F1 (105 mm)|CN-105-F1]] cannon for their [[AMX-30 (Family)|AMX-30 tanks]]. The gun's claim to fame is the OCC 105 F1 HEAT shell that allows the {{PAGENAME}} tank to penetrate up to 400 mm of armour from any distance.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 3 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 8 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 1 - 2.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 and 2 into rack 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

Like most other M4 Sherman platforms, the {{PAGENAME}} contains a standard coaxial machine gun, and a pintle-mounted heavy machine gun. Both remain useful for harassing low-flying aircraft and defeating lightly-armoured vehicles that may not warrant a 105 mm round.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The {{PAGENAME}} is a relatively complex tank to play as it has characteristics that serve the tank well, yet just as many characteristics that are a detriment to the tank's ability to perform its roles.

The {{PAGENAME}}'s weaknesses should be recognized first. Its survivability after a first hit is poor as the {{PAGENAME}} is built on a M4A3 hull with no substantial armour improvement. As such the front armour array has poor protection against the kind of armaments the tank is expected to go against. What is also not helping is the tank's relatively slow speed, which makes travelling from cover to cover a longer chore. Combined with the tank's large profile with the Sherman hull body and the long 105 mm gun, it would be relatively easy to spot an exposed {{PAGENAME}} from a distance and destroy it. Another drawback is the ammunition composition available, with only chemical-energy shells (HEAT, HE, Smoke) available. This means that the gunner must ensure there is no light cover or foliage that would detonate the shell before it can reach its target.

However, noteworthy characteristics of the {{PAGENAME}} for its favor is, of course, the armament. The large 105 mm gun is capable of delivering a HEAT shell a distance away. This allows the tank to attack targets of its choosing without regards to penetration drop-off with distance. The turret also has a reasonable traverse rate and elevation ranges, allowing for quick target responses and use in different terrain and hills.

With these considerations in mind, the {{PAGENAME}} would excel in the "sniper tank" or "ambusher" role. Play these roles in the defense as the {{PAGENAME}} does not have great mobility to get to certain locations before the enemy will. Instead, allow the enemy to roll into the {{PAGENAME}}'s field of fire closer in the friendly team side. Set up the {{PAGENAME}} in areas covering known enemy advances towards the objectives, their transit in between objectives, or their movements into friendly front-lines after capturing the objectives. Good fire zones can be established with the 105 mm's HEAT round, using the generous gun depression angles for hull-down locations to use terrain as cover. Alternatively, one may also exploit the {{PAGENAME}}'s height to find rock formations low enough to cover the hull, but also expose the turret to allow the {{PAGENAME}} to fire from behind cover before withdrawing to reload so the enemy doesn't hit and penetrate the turret.

Alternatively, the {{PAGENAME}} may be used as a "brawler" role by getting up close to the enemy. This role is not well-advised due to the {{PAGENAME}}'s weak armour, slow mobility, and average reload speed. However, the tank's gun and turret traverse rate allow the {{PAGENAME}} to be rather responsive in close-quarter combat. Perform this roles with allies, especially those in more dangerous tanks like heavy tanks, in order to reduce the likelihood that the {{PAGENAME}} is the first to be targeted during these attacks. If the {{PAGENAME}} is caught isolated, it will very quickly be torn to pieces. Use the available smoke grenades to make a retreat if needed.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Impressive firepower thanks to HEAT's 400 mm penetration
* Great long range cannon since HEAT retains penetration regardless of distance
* Wide FOV in the gunner's sight
* Quick turret traverse
* 4 turret-mounted smoke grenades

'''Cons:'''

* Massive gun wobbling: the gun is not stabilised and bounces a lot
* Poor top speed and acceleration
* With its poor armour and massive gun, close quarters combat is not recommended
* Cramped turret due to the large breech
* Fires only early HEAT shells, which are prone to ricochets and inconsistent damage
* The HEAT shell has low muzzle velocity and unreliable post-penetration damage, aiming at ammunition and crew positions is necessary
* The large muzzle brake catches a lot of shells, destroying the gun

== History ==

Upon its establishment in 1948, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) was desperate to set up an armoured corps in order to contend with the multi-pronged Arab invasion. World War II surplus early-model [[M4|M4 Sherman]] tanks, many of them already rendered combat-ineffective, were purchased from any European source that would provide them. A significant Israeli repair effort finally managed to get most of these tanks working in time to defeat the invading armoured battalions, ultimately winning the war. The basic M4 remained the IDF's primary tank for more than half a decade, precisely because it was considered obsolete everywhere else and could therefore be purchased en-masse at scrapyard prices. During the early 1950s it was slowly replaced with more advanced Sherman models, whenever those could be acquired.

Unfortunately for the IDF, this situation could not continue for long. Newfound cooperation between the Arab states and the Soviet Union resulted in an influx of [[T-34-85]]s into the region, whose armour was very difficult to penetrate using the M4's original [[M3 (75 mm)|75 mm M3]] cannon. It was obvious that the Shermans would need to be replaced in order to keep up with the arms race. Initially, the IDF considered purchasing the new [[AMX-13]] from France (which was rapidly becoming Israel's primary weapon supplier), but the tank was determined to be too lightly armoured. Instead, a number of French CN-75-50 cannons (also known as the [[SA50 L/57 (75 mm)|SA50 L/57]]) were purchased separately and installed into the turrets of existing [[M4A4 (France)|M4A4 Shermans]]. This resulted in the Sherman M-50, known abroad as the "Super Sherman" and in War Thunder as the [[M4A4 (SA50)]].

The M-50s proved highly effective during the Sinai War of 1956, but the lessons of that war resulted in the Soviets flooding the region - particularly Egypt and Syria - with the newest [[T-54/55 (Family)|T-54/55]], armed with a 100 mm cannon and carrying more modern curved armour. Once again, new French [[AMX-30]]s were rejected as replacements for the M-50, but their new [[CN-105-F1 (105 mm)|CN-105-F1 105 mm]] cannons proved quite suitable for the IDF's purposes. The Israelis modified these cannons to their own specifications, slightly reducing barrel length and muzzle velocity as well as fitting the cannon with a brand new muzzle brake. This modified cannon would be installed on an [[M4A1]] Sherman hull fitted with a T23 turret (the turret originally used for 76 mm Sherman variants). The tank was then fitted with a number of additional modernization features, including infrared spotlights and a better fire control system.

This new model was dubbed the Sherman M-51, of which 180 were constructed in total. They first saw action during the Six-Day War of 1967, where they often outmatched Syrian and Egyptian T-55s. In combat in the West Bank during that war, the M-51 exceeded expectations even further by thoroughly defeating Jordanian [[M48A1|M48 Pattons]] - very similar to the model that was in the process of replacing the M-51 in IDF service at the time. Despite becoming effectively obsolete by the 1970s, the M-51s were called back into action in 1973 during the desperate situation of the Yom Kippur War, and reportedly managed to hold their own even against late-model [[T-62]] tanks.

All in all, the M-51 is considered to be the last and most advanced version of the Sherman ever produced.
