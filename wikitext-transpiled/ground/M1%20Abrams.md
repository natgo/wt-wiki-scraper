== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', or just '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''', is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 "Advancing Storm"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The armour is decent, with the LFP being able to stop rounds such as 3BM22, 3BM15, 3BM9, offering about 430 mm of kinetic protection against these three rounds. It can also stop the 105 mm DM23 and 120 mm L23 rounds. The Abrams has around 410/415 mm of protection against these rounds. The lower front plate is nigh impenetrable to nearly all HEATFS shells and ATGMs. The UFP is decent as well: it can ricochet shots right into the huge turret ring, so when playing, keep it in mind. The turret fares much better against these shots. It offers 440 mm of protection, being able to stop these rounds.

When uptiered, you will face 120 mm 3BM42, M829, DM23 and DM33 rounds: they will shred through your armour like paper. Even then, your armour might ricochet when moving and save you when retreating.

The gun mantlet is also huge and all APFSDS and HEATFS rounds can go trough (though this is a weak spot all vehicles have). Like most western MBTs, survivability is good, with the crew being far apart from each other as well as wet ammo stowage.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

Overall mobility is superb, even without mobility modifications researched it can still outaccelerate most contemporary vehicles. Hull traverse is however poor, with it becoming only decent when all mobility modifications researched. The M1 Abrams is a fairly quick main battle tank. It accelerates quickly, and will hold a speed of 52 km/h (32 mph) over rough terrain. On city maps or paved surfaces, an M1 Abrams can easily reach its top speed of 72 km/h (45 mph), thanks to its monstrously powerful turbine engine. With three speeds in reverse, it is also capable of an impressive 40 km/h (25 mph) to back away from troublesome situations. As powerful as the motor may be, the M1 Abrams has a slow to respond, and relatively slow traverse rate for its neutral steering. In some circumstances, it may be more beneficial to back away before turning around, as waiting for the neutral steering to turn 180 degrees is lengthy.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|M68A1 (105 mm)}}

The gun performance is adequate. While the shells are good against angles, they can penetrate weak spots and the sides of enemy vehicles with ease. At long ranges the gun can struggle, especially against enemies in a hull down position. Most Soviet/Russian MBTs in a hull down position only have the following weak spots: the gun mantlet and the driver hatch window, located just below the gun. The M1 Abrams also suffers from a raised engine deck. As such, its capacity for "over the shoulder" shots and shots directly over the rear is very limited, because the engine deck prevents the lowering of the cannon.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Its armour, whilst reliable in downtiers and when facing tanks of the same BR, should not be relied on when uptiered. Many tanks will destroy you. But when downtiered, your armour will protect you 70-75% of the time. Many rounds at this BR and below have a hard time facing you and even penetrating you in the LFP even.

It is suggested to use the M735, since at distance many rounds will not hit the target and the M774 costs 600 SL to fire and has only got a better angle penetration. Although it has a low penetration, the M735 and the M774 are still APFSDS, and as such, you can get a penetrating hit on an enemy's side even with a very low impact angle.

The Abrams' main strength is its extreme mobility, even by MBT standards, and the very good ballistics of the APFSDS rounds. The armour is not sufficient and will only really stop ATGMs and HEATFS rounds. But when facing tanks at this BR and below, enemies have a hard time penetrating your frontal arc.

Additionally, The M1 has somewhat sub-par penetration even with its best shell. Because of these factors, it is recommended that you do not use this tank as a frontline brawler. Instead, use your speed to quickly appear from angles your opponents are not expecting you to come from. This can take the form of flanking in order to get side shots, Rushing at the start of the game to take an advantageous position, or getting to choke points before the enemy does, in order to be ready to knock them out. Essentially, This tank should be played much like the M18 Hellcat, though unlike the Hellcat your armour can still help you occasionally when uptiered.

When downtiered, this should be played as a balanced tank, with armour and speed, only really lacking firepower.

A useful thing to note when playing the Abrams, and most MBTs in general, is that if your opponent shows any side armour, you can penetrate them almost every time. if someone is coming towards you even at a slight angle, aim for the front drive wheel on their tracks. Your shell will be able to penetrate into the tank and likely knock them out with a single shot. It is recommended to use APFSDS as the main loadout, as the HEATFS ammunition starts coming against tanks with armour types specifically designed to resist it.

In terms of threats:

* [[Type 90]] and [[AMX-40]], as their incredibly powerful shots can penetrate you anywhere, at any angle, at almost any distance. For the Type 90, aim for the turret ring, and for the AMX-40, aim for the LFP.
* The T-80B, because of its strong armament and very strong armour; it can be penetrated through its lower front plate, the drivers viewport below the gun, and just to the side or below the gun; if a T80B shows any of its side, you can penetrate it there

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* LFP and turret face can easily stop 3BM22, other soviet rounds, DM23 (105 mm) and L23.
* Good chemical protection due to composite armour, especially on the turret
* Internal armour plating increases crew survivability
* Very good mobility for its weight
* Great forward and reverse speed
* Very good acceleration
* Turns very fast, even in neutral steering
* Very accurate and fast-firing main gun
* Blowout panels protect the crew from ammo rack detonation
* Although composite armour is absent on the upper glacis plate, the extreme sloping makes shells bounce every time

'''Cons:'''

* Large target
* The three shells under the gun do NOT have blowout panels, if detonated you will die
* No composite armour on the upper glacis plate and in the rear of the turret, so remaining on level terrain is priority
* The turret ring is a massive and easily penetrated weak spot
* The armour's high chemical resistance is not relevant against contemporary enemies usually equipped with APFSDS
* Losing some crew members will prevent you from firing some of your smoke grenades
* Low APFSDS penetration
* Inadequate stock ammo loadout: both the M735 and M456 shells are no longer effective at this BR
* NVD are a tier III modification
* M774 is a tier IV modification and it is still a fairly weak round for this BR
* Like with most Abrams series tanks, the engine deck is slightly raised, meaning that you will not be able to depress the gun over the rear of the tank.

Once the unsuccessful joint German-American MBT-70 project had been shut down in 1971, the Congress redistributed funds to the further development of the XM815 project, later known as the XM1 Abrams. The development of the XM1 Abrams was a competition between two designs of the Chrysler and General Motors companies, respectively. Early July 1973 marks an important date for the project after representatives of both companies travelled to Great Britain to witness the development of the new composite armour, named Burlington. Impressed by what they saw, both companies decided to reevaluate and optimize their designs' armour layout to increase its effectiveness, with General Motors changing the front shape of the turret to a sloped surface, whilst Chrysler retained its vertical design. By 1976, the XM1 prototypes were being readied for testing, with the finishing touch being the installation of the M68 cannon.. Testing of both prototypes took place in the presence of the new German Leopard 2 tank, which was shipped to the U.S. for comparison purposes. Once testing was concluded and the results evaluated, the turbine-powered Chrysler design was proclaimed the winner of the competition and thus the Chrysler design would soon enter production as the M1 Abrams.
[[File:M1 Abrams REFORGER 82 - National Archives 6505991.jpeg|x200px|right|none|thumb|An M1 Abrams during Exercise Reforger 82 "Carbine Fortress"]]

The M1 entered production in 1979, with the first production version M1 leaving the factory floor in February 1980. Production of the M1 continued until 1985, with an improved M1IP version being produced briefly between 1984 -1986. By 1985, several thousands of M1s had already been manufactured and put into service. In August 1985 however, the M1 was outfitted with the license-built version of the Rheinmetall 120 mm gun, as found on the Leopard 2 tank and subsequently entered production as the M1A1 Abrams. Following this modification, earlier M1 units would progressively be upgraded to M1A1 standard, but this is a story for another devblog in the future. The M1 Abrams saw the most active service with US forces primarily in operations in the Middle East, but known operators also include Australia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others. Nonetheless, the American M1 Abrams is one of the most successful and widely fielded modern-day MBTs in use anywhere in the world, and rightfully deserves its iconic status alongside other American legends such as the M4 Sherman and M60 Patton, to name but a few. The fact that the M1 Abrams is still being manufactured and used today, almost four decades after its introduction, serves as a testimony to that statement.
