== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]]. Different to the real one, the M1 KVT in War Thunder was modified from [[M1 Abrams]] instead of [[M1A1]]. There are several differences on their appearance. Compared to the prototype, the side skirts were removed, and a frontal rubber-fabric screen was added. The gun barrel was covered by a camo net. A fake IR searchlight was mounted on the gun mantlet, and many fake ERA blocks were installed on the turret and the upper glacis. Two external fuel barrels were welded to the rear to mimic Soviet MBTs. The M240 pintle-mounted light machine gun on the reloader's cupola was removed, and each side of the turret had a board with the inscription "ЛОДКА" (‘boat’ in Russian) fixed on the basket.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour of the M1 KVT is quite similar to the M1 Abrams with a few differences. The side skirts were removed, and a frontal rubber-fabric screen was equipped which gave its lower glacis more effective armour of chemical protection. The turret and the frontal hull were installed with several fake ERA blocks which weren't modelled and thus contributed zero additional protection. The M1 KVT has decent frontal armour overall which gives it a great advantage in battles. The left turret cheek offers better protection compared to the right one, yet they both worked well at blocking most projectiles around its BR. The lower glacis offers a similar level of protection to the turret cheeks. On the other hand, the upper glacis is extremely angled which may bounce most shells. Those bounced shells are likely to be absorbed by the composite armour modules of the turret cheeks at last. However, the lower part of the main gun mantlet along with the turret ring is very fragile: most large-calibre shells can easily penetrate it. Most reserve ammo is stored at the rear of the turret and such penetration is very likely to detonate them. Due to the thin roof armour, the gunner optics shield is actually another weak spot that has a risk of overpressuring your entire crew by catching large-calibre HE shells such as 3OF26, 9M119, and DTB-125.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, turret ring)
* Rubber-fabric screens (frontal skirt)
* Structural steel (spaced armour, external fuel barrels)
* Composite screen (side skirts, mounted when the vismod modification is removed)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and tracks are 20 mm thick, and the frontal skirt is 4 mm thick.
* The frontal part of the underbody is 25.4 mm thick, and the rear one is 12.7 mm thick.
* There are a few spaced armour on the turret sides that are 4 mm thick.
* Two 38 mm thick internal RHA screens separate the crew compartment from most ammo racks and the engine compartment. Another two 19 mm thick internal RHA screens encircle two exterior fuel tanks.
* By removing the vismod modification, the frontal skirt is removed, and the side skirts which contain 65 mm of the composite screen at the frontal section will be mounted.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The M1 KVT has brilliant mobility around its BR. With the high power-to-weight ratio and decent off-road mobility, the M1 KVT can swiftly accelerate to the average speed of ~60 km/h on most terrains. It also has acceptable hull traverse speed and one of the best reverse speed in top-tier MBTs. Those features make the M1 KVT a very competent all-purpose tank whether to flank, brawl, or translocate yourself.

{{main|M68A1 (105 mm)}}

Sharing the same main gun as the M1 Abrams, the M1 KVT has mediocre firepower when fighting with the enemy in hull-down positions. Most Soviet/Russian MBTs around its BR have sufficient turret protection to absorb its shells. The M1 KVT's engine also makes a loud noise which is very lethal when the enemy is experienced and has high vigilance. The elevated engine decks and two additional fuel barrels welded on it significantly limit its gun depression and movement backwards. Despite those defects, its main gun is very accurate with the thermal sights, competent two-plane stabilizer, and laser rangefinder. It has amazing -10° of gun depression and relatively fast reloading speed. You can also remove the annoying external fuel barrels by disabling the vismod modification.

The 12.7 mm M2HB machine gun pintle-mounted on the commander's cupola is good at clearing obstacles and fighting both light vehicles and aerial targets.

The machine gun fixed coaxially at the right side of the main gun can only cause effective damage on light vehicles with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets in realistic battles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The frontal armour of M1 KVT is well-balanced and most APFSDSs with less penetration of 400 mm won't cause trouble on you without aiming carefully. However, every MBT above 10.3 of battle rating has proper APDSFS to penetrate the M1 KVT at any spot. On the other hand, your best shell the M774 is underperforming even in the battles with the same BR. Hence, it's recommended that you should make use of its brilliant mobility, quick reloading, and good gun handling like a light tank. Keep flanking the enemy and translocating yourself. Noted that its engine is quite noisy, so remember to turn off your engine when you are ambushing the enemy.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* ~400 mm of frontal kinetic protection overall and blowout panels at the rear of the turret protecting preloaded and primary ammo racks
* Wonderful acceleration, top speed, reverse speed, and off-road mobility
* Very accurate gun, gunner thermal sight, competent two-plane stabilizer, and brilliant depression and elevation
* Relatively fast reloading speed, 5-second reload with full-upgraded aced crew

'''Cons:'''
* The firepower of the main gun is insufficient around its BR
* Downhill terrain significantly decreases the effectiveness of its frontal armour
* Elevated engine decks limit turret rear angle depression
** VISMOD unique barrels effectively disables rear angle turret views (This can however be disabled by unequipping the VISMOD module)
* VISMOD removes side panel armour (same as rear barrels, can be unequipped to regain panels)
* Almost no frontal protection against an APFSDS that has more penetration than 450 mm
