== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
As a member of the M1 Abrams Family, the armour of the M1 KVT is quite similar to the M1 Abrams with a few differences. The side skirts were removed, and a frontal rubber-fabric screen was equipped which gave its lower glacis more effective armour of chemical protection. The turret and the frontal hull were installed with several fake ERA blocks which weren't modelled and thus contributed zero additional protection. The M1 KVT has decent frontal armour overall which gives it a great advantage in battles. The left turret cheek offers better protection compared to the right one, yet they both worked well at blocking most projectiles around its BR. The upper glacis is extremely angled which may bounce most shells, while the lower one offers a similar level of protection to the turret cheeks. However, the lower part of the main gun mantlet along with the turret ring is very fragile that most large-calibre shells won't have trouble penetrating it. Most reserve ammo is stored at the rear of the turret and the aforementioned penetration is very likely to detonate them. Due to the thin roof armour, the gunner optics shield is actually another weak spot that has a risk to catch HE shells and overpressure the entire crew.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, turret ring, underbody)
* Rubber-fabric screens (frontal skirts)
* Structural steel (spaced armour)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and tracks are 20 mm thick, and the frontal skirt is 4 mm thick.
* The frontal part of the underbody is 25.4 mm thick, and the rear one is 12.7 mm thick.
* There are a few spaced armour on the turret sides that are 4 mm thick.
* Two 38 mm thick internal RHA screens separate the crew compartment from the engine and turret ammo racks. Another two 19 mm thick internal RHA screens encircle two exterior fuel tanks.
