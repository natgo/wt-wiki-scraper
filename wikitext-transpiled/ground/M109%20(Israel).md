== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Israel first acquired the '''{{Specs|name}}''' at the end of the 1960s, and later fielded more modern versions of the M109 like the M109A1 and M109A2. The first combat seen by the vehicle was during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and while Israeli doctrine did not incentivise a predominant role for its artillery, the precision mobility of the M109 proved its effectiveness in striking enemy strategic points. In a similar way, the M109 was used during the 1982 Lebanon War. By the 2006 Lebanon War, the early M109s were all replaced with its longer range versions.

Introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]], the M109 fields a very powerful HE shell in a somewhat capable cannon. The short barrel of this M109 is not the most capable at dealing with long ranges, but it is very easy to operate even for beginners. The M109 is better used as a support tank, flanking or staying behind cover and ambushing incoming enemies. Aiming for the top of the turret, the bottom of the hull, or the engine compartment are the best ideas, since the 155 mm HE shell fielded by this tank is not powerful enough to consistently penetrate tanks from the front, especially Cold War MBTs.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour on the M109 is nearly non-existent, being surrounded by 32 mm thick aluminium alloy 5083, which effectively comes down to 13-20 mm RHA. This leaves the vehicle vulnerable to even light machine gun fire from any angle. The weakness of the armour turns into a strong-suit against AP shells that will pass straight through, unable to fuse or create enough spall to inflict major damage. Direct hits from HE and other chemical shells will most likely leave the M109 a burning wreck. The 6 crew members are pretty spaced apart in the turret, giving a plus to crew survivability.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The M109 should be played as a manually-aimed artillery unit that engages enemies while they are distracted. It is important to stick close to allies and avoid being flanked by faster tanks. The M109's mobility is decent enough to allow it to get to a position in time.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful weapon: M109 has a powerful 155 mm howitzer that can deal significant damage to enemy vehicles
* Long range: M109 can fire up to 30 km, allowing it to engage enemies from a safe distance
* Decent mobility: M109's mobility is decent enough to allow it to get to a position in time
* Effective against tanks: M109 can be used to destroy tanks
* Good support unit: M109 can be used to support team tanks

'''Cons:'''

* Low rate of fire: M109 has a low rate of fire, which can make it difficult to engage multiple targets quickly
* Poor armour: M109 is not well-armoured and can be easily destroyed by enemy fire
* Vulnerable to flanking: M109 is vulnerable to flanking by faster tanks
* Requires manual aiming: M109 is a manually-aimed artillery unit, which can make it difficult to hit moving targets
* Limited ammunition: M109 has a limited number of rounds, which can make it difficult to sustain fire for extended periods of time
