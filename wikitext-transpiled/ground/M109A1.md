== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced into American service in 1973 as an improved version of the M109 self-propelled howitzer. The main improvement was the installation of a new 155 mm M185 cannon, which had a longer barrel and a higher muzzle velocity than the previous M126. This increased the effective range of the M109A1 from 14.6 km to 18 km, giving it an advantage over foreign artillery. It was known for its role in supporting the US Army's operations in Europe and the Middle East, where it could provide fire support for ground forces and counter-battery fire against enemy artillery. The existing M109A1's were later converted to the M109A2 standard, which incorporated 27 RAM (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability) improvements.

The {{Specs|name}} was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. It has similar characteristics to the Soviet [[2S3M]] and can deliver powerful 155 mm shells over long distances and relocate swiftly to evade enemy fire. The M109A1 has an average rate of fire and large ammo capacity, and its mobility is complemented by a good top speed and acceleration. However, its armour is not very thick, so it's recommended to use the M109A1's speed to avoid direct confrontations when possible. Moreover, it is essential to keep in mind that the M109A1 has low gun depression and cannot depend on firing from elevated positions.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour on the M109 is nearly non-existent, being surrounded by 32 mm thick aluminium alloy 5083, which effectively comes down to 13-20 mm RHA. This leaves the vehicle vulnerable to even light machine gun fire from any angle. The weakness of the armour turns into a strong-suit against AP shells that will pass straight through, unable to fuse or create enough spall to inflict major damage. Direct hits from HE and other chemical shells such as HEAT, will most likely leave the M109 a burning wreck. The 6 crew members are pretty spaced apart in the turret, giving a plus to crew survivability.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy.

{{main|M185 (155 mm)}}

The M109A1's high projectile speed compared to other M109 variants makes it a bit easier to aim, but generally still low. Its high explosive round is very effective against German tanks, not so much against Soviet ones. Remember to pre-turn your turret, as your rotation speed is abysmal.

{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)}}

The 12.7 mm M2HB is able to penetrate lightly-armoured vehicles, take down low-flying aircraft or mow down obstacles. The machine gun has a limited amount of ammo, so use it sparingly.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The 155 mm cannon is surprisingly adept at destroying any tank, even up to heavies of the same or slightly higher BRs. It is important to remember that accuracy is low with this gun, but destructive capability is astronomical. Thus, it is best to put yourself in a well defended position and rely on ambush tactics, at least in Realistic mode. The M109 makes an exceptionally good target for planes with its large profile and thin armour, so plane strafing is something you'll have to be careful of.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to HE and HE-VT shells with more than 9 kg of TNT
* Top speed of 56 km/h that it can easily reach
* Can be surprisingly survivable, usually not taken out in a single shot
* Impressive 75° elevation limit
* Top mounted .50 cal for taking out softer targets

'''Cons:'''

* Hindered by a limited gun depression of -3 degrees
* The gunner optics have a low zoom level (4X)
* Thin armour, will only stop small arms fire
* Long reload (17.1 seconds stock)

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== [[wt:en/news/8537-development-m109-the-king-of-battle-en|Devblog]] ===
Development of the M109 began in the early 1950s under a U.S. program to develop a common chassis for a number of different SPH designs. Upon entering service, the M109 was immediately deployed to the Vietnam War. However, its operational service during the conflict was cut short due to serious mechanical malfunctions which rendered the fleet inoperable. Nonetheless, after being addressed and receiving its first upgrade to the A1 standard, the M109 would continue service with U.S. forces for decades to come, taking part in virtually all military conflicts where U.S. forces were deployed in. Once its design eventually matured, the M109 successfully resisted replacement on multiple occasions and continuously received upgrades until the present day.
