== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour on the M109 is nearly non-existent, being surrounded by 32 mm thick aluminium alloy 5083, which effectively comes down to 13-20 mm RHA. This leaves the vehicle vulnerable to even light machine gun fire from any angle. The weakness of the armour turns into a strong-suit against AP shells that will pass straight through, unable to fuse or create enough spall to inflict major damage. Direct hits from HE and other chemical shells will most likely leave the M109 a burning wreck. The 6 crew members are pretty spaced apart in the turret, giving a plus to crew survivability.

'''Armour type:'''

* Aluminium alloy 5083 (Hull, turret)
* Rolled homogeneous armor (Radiator covers)<!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

'''Notes''':

* {{PAGENAME}} uses two-piece ammunition, composed of propellant bags (orange) and projectiles (yellow). Both have separate racks.
* Projectiles and propellant bags are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* 4th rack (for the projectiles) and 3rd rack (for the propellants) are first stage ammo rack. It totals 16 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* Loading 17 (''+11'') shells will keep the hull floor and part of both sides empty of ammo.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list.

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 155 mm cannon, can take out heavy tanks rather effortlessly
* Great elevation angles
* Access to proxy munitions
* (RB) Slightly faster shell velocity than other short-barrelled artillery tanks, may be easier to aim

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turret traverse speed
* Low survivability due to thin armour and munition placement, cannot sustain even 12.7 mm HMG
* Long reload when compared to normal tanks
* (mostly AB) Shell velocity does not let the tank to fire over a hill at short to medium range 
* (RB) Bad optics zoom, inadequate for sniping at long distances

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The story of the M109 begins during the late stages of the Cold War, it would be designed due to a need from the American army to completely replace their aging fleet of M44 self-propelled howitzer. The main objectives for the new and improved replacement were for it to be somewhat mobile and have a bigger calibre. Initial prototypes for the M109 would see it armed with a 105 mm cannon, but would later be changed to a 155 mm. It was also chosen to equip the vehicle with a diesel engine which, although it would prove to give less output, was much more reliable so breaking down would not become a common occurrence. It would first officially enter service in the American army by 1961, and would prove to be quite effective on the battlefield.

Italy comes into play also, post-war they were lacking in a lot of sectors, so America would be generous enough to supply the Italian army with M44 self-propelled howitzers. However, they also soon desired a heavy SPH that would be mobile enough and be able to be operated in multiple types of environments. Eventually after a lot of discussions, the first batches of M109 is would be acquired by the Italian army in 1962. Initially, part of the deal with Italy included 221 M109s equipped with 155 mm cannons. Other part of the deal saw Italy purchase up to 62 versions of the M109A1B. Some of the original M109s were later upgraded by OTO Melara to the M109L standard which had been modified to utilize the 155 mm cannon made by OTO Melara. Italy improved the combat effectiveness of their M109s by adding a "rammer" which heavily reduced operator fatigue while also increasing the rate of fire of the vehicle.

In terms of survivability, the M109 is not the most armoured vehicle there is, but it is said that it could withstand the majority of small arms fire and shell splinters that may happen to hit the vehicle when an enemy performs a counter artillery attack. However, that said, even the weakest HE or HEAT rounds would make short work of the M109, the platform houses its munitions at the back of the turret, so it is safe to say that it would not be able to hold its own against most ground vehicle threats if shot there. In terms of mobility, depending on the version, most M109s can reach speeds of up to 35 km/h, with an overall range of 216 miles. It is powered by a Detroit Diesel 8V71T engine which produces 450 hp.

The M109 has been combat proven in many theatres of war all around the world. The Italian army would mostly use the M109 for various missions and peacekeeping operations, for example during the Kosovo War, where it provided much needed artillery fire for the troops on the ground. Most sources however state that the majority if not all M109s that the Italian army had used, have been phased out during the early 2000s for the more modern and stronger PzH 2000 artillery piece.

Besides the upgrades done by the Italian army, Leonardo created an upgrade for the M109 which added a new cannon able to fire projectiles at a longer range, alongside with the integration of the new Italian-made guided Vulcano munitions.
