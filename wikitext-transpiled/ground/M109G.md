== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Similar to all other vehicles in the [[M109 (Family)|M109 family]], the M109G lacks for armor whatsoever, and will only stop light machine gun rounds. Although, on paper, the vehicle is protected by ~30mm of armor frontally, it being made of aluminum reduces its effectiveness. Strafing aircraft, even those with only .50 cals, will be deadly to the M109. 

The SPH has a generous 6 crew member count, five in the turret and one in the hull. Thanks to the gigantic gun breech, the turret crew sits far apart, with the gunner sitting on the left (from rear POV). Thus, a penetrating hit from AP/APHE shells will rarely one-shot you. They will most likely take out the large breech or destroy the gun barrel instead, far worse than losing a few crew members. Thankfully, the driver and engine sit away from the turret, oftentimes allowing you to escape after suffering a hit. Other HE/HEAT slingers, though (e.g. [[M109A1]], [[2S1]]), will perforate your vehicle no matter what. Overall, try not to be hit, and break cover only to fire.

'''Notes:''' <!-- Any additional notes which the user needs to be aware of -->
<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
For an SPG, the M109G accelerates rather quickly, able to reach ~40 KPH off road rapidly. Of course, the -12 KPH reverse speed and neutral steering will also provide you with great agility.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}Like with all ground vehicles, always research parts first. Proceed, then, to mitigate the terrible turret traverse with "Horizontal Drive" and (if you so desire) "Tracks". An improved "Brake System" and "Suspension" will help the gun stabilize faster. At Tier III, prioritize "Elevation Mechanism" for even better gun controls. Then, research smoke screen, or skip to engine upgrades. 

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}
=== Main armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}
<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|M126 (155 mm)}}

What makes the M109G so lethal is its gun: a huge 155mm howitzer. Being a cold-war invention, the gun can fire HE rounds with 9 kilograms of TNT equivalent. When properly aimed, it will take out any tank, up to top-tier MBTs. To do so, aim at either the lower turret face or turret top to destroy the weak roof armor on tanks. Refrain from shooting the hull, as tracks will frequently absorb the round, or pure armor will prevent it from dealing damage. The stock HE shell should be your main choice. 

There is an unlock able HE-VT round that can be utilized against planes, but its mere 3 meter trigger radius and low velocity discourages an AA play style. Another option, the M110 shell, will deploy a smoke screen wherever it lands. On other tanks, this may be useful in certain situations, yet the long reload time, and the fact that HE shells do not lose penetration over range, makes firing smoke questionable at best.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG3A1 (7.62 mm)}}

A main feature that separates the M109G from most others in the [[M109 (Family)|M109 family]] is the lack of a .50 cal defensive MG. Instead, a low-caliber 7mm is present, offering little protection against planes. Never rely on this gun, and certainly do not fire at planes with this (unless they are diving at you), since it will attract their attention to a juicy target.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Originally designed to provide heavy fire support for armored forces by the United States Army, the M109G should be played in a similar role in War Thunder. Stick close to allies, and act as manually-aimed artillery, engaging enemies while they are distracted. 

It is advised not to engage in a sniping engagement with other tanks, especially if you have the high ground. Due to the poor gun depression and difficult to master shell arc, it is extremely difficult to hit enemies at range. Instead, attempt to target enemies at medium to short range, preferably with immediate cover available after firing. Utilize the reverse speed to back away from cover, exposing only your turret, and fire. Never attempt to brawl on this vehicle; an inadequate turret traverse, coupled with painfully long reload speed, reduces your ability to quickly react. 

If you consider putting bushes on this tank, place them on the large turret cheeks to disguise this tank when peeking out of cover. However, placing the bushes too high can increase your profile, making it more difficult to hide. 

=== Pros and cons ===
'''Pros:'''

* Quite mobile
* Smoke grenades can cover you whilst reloading
* Survivable against AP derivatives 
* Powerful armament, can one-shot anything
* Neutral steering

*

'''Cons:'''

* Only -3° gun depression
* Slow turret traverse speed
* Almost nonexistent armor
* Long reload
* Slow shell velocity and average optics zoom making it bad for sniping 
* No .50 cal HMG

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->=== Devblog History===
Development of the M109 began in the early 1950s under a U.S. program to develop a common chassis for a number of different SPH designs. Upon entering service, the M109 was immediately deployed to the Vietnam War. However, its operational service during the conflict was cut short due to serious mechanical malfunctions which rendered the fleet inoperable. Nonetheless, after being addressed and receiving its first upgrade to the A1 standard, the M109 would continue service with U.S. forces for decades to come, taking part in virtually all military conflicts where U.S. forces were deployed in. Once its design eventually matured, the M109 successfully resisted replacement on multiple occasions and continuously received upgrades until the present day.
