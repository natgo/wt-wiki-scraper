== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The M1128 Wolfpack's narrow profile turret provides a significant advantage in combat situations. The vehicle may face challenges in terms of survivability due to its thinner armour and the relatively close proximity of its crew members. The hull of M1128 Wolfpack is invincible to most rounds from machine guns, but autocannons and HE shells with larger calibre won't have trouble knocking it out with few shots. In certain circumstances, the tall vehicle profile can be a disadvantage because it restricts the vehicle's ability to take cover and remain hidden, leaving it more open to enemy fire. Thankfully, the commander and gunner are located relatively low inside the turret basket, and all ammo racks are inside the hull. These features minimise the risk of getting one-shot from a successful turret penetration in most hull-down battles. Sometimes, the huge machine gun shield might help enemy ATGMs detonate over the hull roof and blow your whole crew up.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

* High-hardness rolled armour (hull, turret, gun shield, underbody, spaced armour)
* MEXAS 2C (applique armour on hull and lower turret)
* MEXAS 2 (applique armour on hull sides and roof)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (turret roof, engine vent, gunner optics shield)

'''Notes:'''

* Wheels are 10 mm thick, and the underbody is 12.7 mm thick.
* There is a 5 mm internal RHA screen separating the engine and the radiator from the other compartments. It also gives additional protection to the driver against fragments and shockwaves from the front.
* .50 cal machine gun shield has 12.7 mm of armour protection.
* Both sides have 6.35 mm thick spaced armour on the rear part of the side armour.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The M1128 Wolfpack, with its advanced suspension and powerful engine, has high forward mobility and can effortlessly manoeuvre through rough terrain. The decent reverse speed also gives M1128 Wolfpack wonderful flexibility in ambush and hull-down battles.

Target identification is effortless thanks to third-generation thermal imaging technology integrated into the gunner, commander, and driver optics. On some maps, such as those where you are engaging targets on uneven terrain, the limited gun depression and elevation is a significant disadvantage.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 2 (autoloader magazine) is a first stage ammo rack and totals 8 shells.
* As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
* Once the autoloader magazine has been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader with at least one shell.
* The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into rack 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

A 12.7 mm M2HB heavy machine gun is settled in the right side of M1128 Wolfpack's turret. It has good penetration and elevation to fight against nearby hostile aircraft and light vehicles. However, its limited horizontal traverse of 75° might cause trouble when dealing with enemy from behind or the left side.

A 7.62 mm M240 light machine gun is fixed coaxially with the tank gun of M1128 Wolfpack. Due to your low main gun ammo count, it will help you a lot ping targets or destroy minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
M1128 Wolfpack is a very competent light vehicle. It works brilliantly as a sniper with high resolution thermal sights, decent APFSDS shell, and laser rangefinder. It also has good mobility and adaptability to manoeuvre across some of the worst terrains that are a nightmare to other wheeled vehicles. These allow you to ambush and flank the enemy from unexpected positions. However, the unimpressive depression and turret rotation speed limit its performance in hilly maps. M1128 Wolfpack is also less effective in static combat and position warfare due to the low amount of main gun ammo. Its hull has poor protection while the turret can absorb many shots from kinetic shells without critical losses. Hence, it's advised to find a mild hull-down hill or proper cover that can hide your hull and allow you to fight back.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Narrow profile turret
* High resolution thermal sights
* High forward mobility

'''Cons:'''

* Low survivability
* Tall vehicle profile
* Bad gun depression and elevation
