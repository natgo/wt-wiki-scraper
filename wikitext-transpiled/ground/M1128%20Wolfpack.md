== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The M1128 Wolfpack's narrow profile turret provides a significant advantage in combat situations. The vehicle may face challenges in terms of survivability due to its thinner armour and the relatively close proximity of its crew members. In certain circumstances, the tall vehicle profile can be a disadvantage because it restricts the vehicle's ability to take cover and remain hidden, leaving it more open to enemy fire.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

'''Notes:''' <!-- Any additional notes which the user needs to be aware of -->
<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The M1128 Wolfpack, with its advanced suspension and powerful engine, has high forward mobility and can effortlessly manoeuvre through rough terrain.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|M68A1E8 (105 mm)}}
Target identification is effortless thanks to third-generation thermal imaging technology integrated into the gunner, commander, and driver optics. On some maps, such as those where you are engaging targets on uneven terrain, the limited gun depression and elevation is a significant disadvantage.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
