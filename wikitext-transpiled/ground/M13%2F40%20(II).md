== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened as '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]] as a battle reward in the [[wt:en/news/5967-news-festivities-in-war-thunder-en|2018 War Thunder Festivities]]. It has since been available for purchase with Golden Eagles.

The M13/40 (II) is nearly identical to its other in-game variants. Compared to the [[M13/40 (I)]], it has 5 degrees worse gun depression, but its reload rate now matches other rank I tanks, being 3.5 seconds after experting the crew. Compared to the [[M13/40 (III)]], it just has worse gun depression with everything else being same.

Visually, it can be distinguished from the [[M13/40 (I)|mark I]] by its default African camouflage and folded antenna on the right side (left if head-on), and by the lack of chassis parts on top of its left track (right if head-on). It can be distinguished from the [[M13/40 (III)|mark III]] only by lack of the block on top of the middle of the turret.

An average gun for its BR, it can penetrate the front of some of the tanks it will face and knock them out with a single shot. It has decent armour, strong enough to bounce shots at high angle. The worst aspect of the M13/40 (II), as with the rest of them, is its speed. Poor acceleration makes it hard to achieve its top speed of 32 km/h, and with worse vertical angles it's even less worth it to go up hills.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

All of your armour, which can realistically be targeted, is flat, so despite quite high frontal armour values the {{PAGENAME}} must always be angled when squaring off with an enemy combatant or risk direct shot penetration of your vehicle. Your side armour value is not as good as the front, but at extreme angles, it becomes more effective.

As long as you angle your tank right, you will have 36 to 50 mm of effective armour thickness and use it to block enemy shots. Destroy British tanks and any SPG as soon as possible, as every single one of them can destroy your tank. It is also worth destroying Soviet and certain USA tanks first as well, however, not every one of them can penetrate your armour.

The rear end is also rather long, so enemies could pick this piece off if it is exposed. But it's better to be shot at your engines, than your crew compartment, located in the middle of the tank. Don't give your opponent any time to do that and make them go away before they started firing onto your second tier.

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour
- Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)

{{main|47/32 mod.35 (47 mm)}}

Like the other M13/40s, the M13/40 (II) has a 47 mm gun with ammunition capable of destroying most of tanks in one shot, assuming they are within 200 m range. Upgraded ammunition improves performance against angled tanks and damage potential at long range.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

{{main|Breda Mod. 38 (8 mm)}}

Although the pintle-mounted machine gun cannot traverse independently of the turret on the horizontal, its limited vertical traverse can make it useful against unprotected enemy crew as well as incoming aircraft. The coaxial-mounted machine gun is hard to use for anything, as it's limited by the traverse of the main gun.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Like the [[M13/40 (I)]], it can be used as a breakthrough tank to push through enemy defences and slowly, but surely destroy them, while driving at them at an angle to maximise armour effectiveness.

Just as with other models, you can also use flank route to go along with your team and to destroy every enemy tank that tries to flank your team.

The important difference from other models is that your gun depression is somewhat worse, so scaling hills is even more risky and has less worth than before. Instead, focus on pushing enemy tanks, as your ammunition is good enough to destroy most tanks in one shot.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very thick gun mantlet
- Good gun depression
- Its shells deal good post-penetration damage

'''Cons:'''

- Unsloped armour is easy to penetrate for opponents
- Slow and unable to climb well
- Struggles against better-armoured foes

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Intended to replace the unsatisfactory M11/39, the M13/40 retained its main mechanical features, but with a more powerful gun in a fully rotating turret. The M13 was slow, unreliable, and suffered from the tank commander doubling as the gunner. Similar to early Soviet and French tanks, it did not receive radios as standard equipment until 1942. Nevertheless, it became the standard Italian medium tank from 1941 on, and is the best known Italian tank of the war. In War Thunder, the M13/40 (II) represents those made in the mid part of the production run, with hydraulic traverse gears and fixed radio installations.

It first saw service with the 3rd Medium Tank Battalion (Battaglione Carri M) in Libya's Sollum-Halfaya region. It later equipped 132nd "Ariete (Ram)" Armoured Division (Divisione Corazzata) in North Africa. From January to April of 1941, it also saw action in Yugoslavia and Greece with the 131st Centauro (Centaur) and 133rd Littorio armoured divisions. For a short time after the first rush of British victories in North Africa in early 1941, there were enough captured M13s to equip a British armoured unit, 6th Royal Tank Regiment, in Libya. These were all lost in turn to Rommel's offensive in March of that year. In late August of 1941, Italian medium tank platoons increased their number from four to five.

When Italy surrendered in September 1943, 22 M13s were captured by Germany, who handed them over to the Italian fascist forces. It is uncertain how many in total were produced, as many were converted to M14/41s: estimates range from 710 to 1,049.
