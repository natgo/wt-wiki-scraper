== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened as '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

The M13/40 (III) is a superior version of the M13/40, which has reload speed and default camouflage of [[M13/40 (II)|model (II)]], while retaining gun depression of [[M13/40 (I)|model (I)]]. You can distinguish it visually from other 2 by spotting small "bump" on its turret's top (above the gun), which was made so that the gun can depress with the new loading mechanism.

The M13/40 (III), as with the rest of the family, is typically used as a breakthrough tank or a "blockade runner" due to the fact that it is very resistant to enemy fire, especially when angled, and can disable or destroy enemy vehicles with only one shot when up close. Beware, however, around the 500 m mark the cannon ammunition starts to lose its punch and can fail to penetrate effectively, and it's not any faster than other tanks of the family.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Most of the hull armour is flat, so despite quite high frontal armour values the {{PAGENAME}} must always be angled when engaging an enemy combatant or risk easy penetration of the vehicle. The side armour value is not as good as the front, but at extreme angles, it becomes more effective. The turret, however, is not as reliably weak. The strange angles of the mantlet and small size makes the turret quite strong against Rank I vehicles and even if a shot does penetrate, the mantlet will likely absorb enough of the shrapnel to keep your turret crew relatively unharmed.

As long as you angle your tank right, you will have 36 to 50 mm of effective armour thickness and use it to block enemy shots. If a hull-down position is available, that will be your best option to increase survivability. Destroy British tanks and any SPG as soon as possible, as every single one of them can destroy your tank. It is also worth prioritizing Soviet and certain USA tanks as well, however not every one of them can penetrate your armour reliably.

The rear end is also rather long, so enemies could pick this piece off if it is exposed. But it's better to be shot at your engines, than your crew compartment, located in the middle of the tank. Don't give your opponent any time to do that and make them go away before they started firing onto your second tier.

This tank has the desert camouflage as the default one, which means you will be at a disadvantage on non-desert maps at first in terms of stealth.

'''Armour type:'''

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=201|rbMinHp=115}}

Mobility of the {{PAGENAME}} is sluggish on anything but flat land, but it's adequate as long as you don't try to climb steep hills or to cross the entire map fast. Attempting steep hill flank will just get you stuck and leave you exposed to enemy fire.

{{main|47/32 mod.35 (47 mm)}}

Ammunition is good enough for flank shots and direct shots at flat armour up to 500 m. Post-penetration effect is enough to destroy most opponents of rank 1 with one or two shots.

Upgraded ammo does not have increased performance against flat armour, however against angled armour it does increase your chances to penetrate turrets along with angled armour and damage something like French tanks at longer range.

Overall, almost nothing can deflect your shots at 100-200 m range.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

{{main|Breda Mod. 38 (8 mm)}}

Although the pintle-mounted machine gun cannot traverse independently of the turret on the horizontal, its limited vertical traverse can make it useful against unprotected SPAA as well as strafing aircraft. The coaxial-mounted machine gun is hard to use for anything, as it's limited by the traverse of the main gun. Additionally, it has a very small magazine size so it's recommended not to needlessly fire your machine guns throughout the battle, and keep a full magazine at all times.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Try to push through enemy fire, while being angled at least 30° to your enemy. Destroy anyone who dares to fire at you, specifically targeting SPGs and those who forgot to angle their armour. Upgrade your ammunition for a better damage profile.

Alternatively, take a slightly flanking direction near to your team and use your strong characteristics to intercept any fast-moving vehicles while moving along with your team. After finishing the cleanup, flank main battle and destroy defenceless opponents.

It's not worth fighting heavily armoured vehicles alone while being angled without upgraded ammo. At a range of 500 m, you will probably only penetrate each other's turret and it's more up to luck than anything. One possibility if fighting from this range, your shell can potentially incapacitate turret crew, disabling the tank and allowing a team member with heavier firepower to finish the target off without the threat of being fired upon.

Tanks equipped with autocannons can destroy you from the rear and sides, however, they often go for engines first. Keep an eye out for them.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Thick gun mantlet
- Excellent gun depression
- Its shells deal good post-penetration damage

'''Cons:'''

- Struggles against better-armoured foes
- Slow and unable to climb well
- Unsloped armour is easy to penetrate for opponents

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Intended to replace the unsatisfactory M11/39, the M13/40 retained its main mechanical features, but with a more powerful gun in a fully rotating turret. The M13 was slow, unreliable, and suffered from the tank commander doubling as the gunner. Similar to early Soviet and French tanks, it did not receive radios as standard equipment until 1942. Nevertheless, it became the standard Italian medium tank from 1941 on, and is the best known Italian tank of the war. In War Thunder, the M13/40 (III) represents those made earlier in the production run, with hydraulic traverse gear and radios in place. They have less maximum ammunition than the (I) model as a result.

The tank first saw service with the 3rd Medium Tank Battalion (Battaglione Carri M) in Libya's Sollum-Halfaya region. It later equipped 132nd "Ariete (Ram)" Armoured Division (Divisione Corazzata) in North Africa. From January to April of 1941, it also saw action in Yugoslavia and Greece with the 131st Centauro (Centaur) and 133rd Littorio armoured divisions. For a short time after the first rush of British victories in North Africa in early 1941, there were enough captured M13s to equip a British armoured unit, 6th Royal Tank Regiment, in Libya. These were all lost in turn to Rommel's offensive in March of that year. In late August of 1941, Italian medium tank platoons increased their number from four to five.

When Italy surrendered in September 1943, 22 M13s were captured by Germany, who handed them over to the Italian fascist forces. It is uncertain how many in total were produced, as many were converted to M14/41s: estimates range from 710 to 1,049.
