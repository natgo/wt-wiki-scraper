== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

As American surplus equipment at the end of WWII, the [[M16 MGMC]] was handed down to Japanese national forces for self-defense and building of a Japanese reserve in the image of the US military.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

As an open-top half-track, the chassis can only really offer some protection against rifle calibre machine guns, even not completely being true for the anti-air turret, which has a viewport with no glass that can knock out the gunner if aimed at correctly with any kind of small arms.

'''Armour type:'''

\*Rolled homogeneous armour

'''Notes:'''

- Suspension bogies are 10 mm thick, suspension wheels are 15 mm thick, and tracks are 7 mm thick. Front wheels provide 2 mm armour.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

Decently mobile for a half-track it offers better off-road capability over fully wheeled trucks allowing it to be a decent choice to capture points and even plausible to flank lightly-armoured vehicles with the AP-I belt.

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=210|rbMinHp=131}}

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

After unlocking parts and FPE, the best course of action is getting the API belt, offering about 30 mm of penetration and a full belt of incendiary munition which will cause havoc among planes and lightly-armoured vehicles alike. After unlocking the API belt, turret adjustments and mobility upgrades can be chosen at player's discretion.

=== Main armament ===

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

'''Notes''':

- Although there are 24 ammo boxes, only 10 are modeled including 4 loaded on the machine guns.
- Since there are four .50 M2HB machine guns, each reload will load 4 ammo boxes onto the guns with each box containing 200 rounds.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

As a lend-lease vehicle from America, the M16 will play exactly like its [[M16 MGMC|American counterpart]]. Posing a large threat to most planes within roughly 1.5 km range, the 4 x .50 cals can shred both plane and pilot after a good burst of direct hits on the plane.

While the M16 and its .50 cals doesn't offer the same explosiveness over Japan's earlier arsenal possessing the [[Type 98 (20 mm)]], it does make up for it in sustained fire due to the multiple barrels and larger belts making sure that once engaged with an enemy plane, there are very few moments where the plane can fly easily as long as you keep sights and trigger on it. You can switch target once the plane flies out of range, gets set on fire, or the pilot is knocked out.

Also unlike the previous Army's arsenal of anti-air, the M16 only offers a maximum penetration of 31 mm and purely is meant to shoot down planes with Incendiary rounds. Though some daring tankers might be able to knock out a light tank or two from the side, with the mediocre mobility of a half-track and lacklustre HMGs, it is ill-advised to use this dedicated anti-air in the anti-tank role.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Strong machine guns that can shred aircraft with a well-aimed burst
- Good mobility; accelerates quickly, fast on flat ground
- Fast turret traverse allows for easily tracking any aircraft
- .50 can knock out open-topped or lightly armoured vehicles

'''Cons:'''

- Any armament above light machine guns (>7.92 mm) poses a threat
- Vulnerable to explosive rounds and bombs dropped by aircraft due to it being open top
- Can easily be taken out by an aircraft with one well-aimed pass; the entire crew is exposed

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

[[File:Parade during establishment of NSF.jpg|right|thumb|x250px|Parade during the establishment of the NSF]]
Prior to the creation of the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force in July of 1954, the Japanese were delegated a security force called the "National Safety Force" (NSF) in 1952. Similar in function to the national police, they were trained by American officers and equipped with American military equipment including most firearms and uniforms. Limited under treaty from building their own military designs, Japan sought assistance from the US to provide its heavy equipment. In particular, Japanese personnel were supplied with 168 M16 half-tracks for logistical needs but also close infantry support. M45 turrets with quad .50 cal mountings were supplied from surplus American stocks and fitted to the vehicles. Under the 1st District Force (NSF), the first anti-air units were comprised using the "hand-me-down" M16s. These vehicles would pass into the JGSDF in 1954 and while they would see use until 1974, almost 20 years after America had discontinued their M16s, they eventually were deemed obsolete for their primary purpose.
