== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', like the [[M16 MGMC (Japan)]], was American surplus equipment at the end of WWII, and was gifted to the start-up of the JSDF. Serving in the JASDF and JGSDF, they were in service until 1979 when they were deemed obsolete.

It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]]. Being a simple hand-me-down from the US, it plays and is exactly the same as the [[M19A1]], offering 2 x 40 mm in a large open-top turret. Having relatively high armour penetration and the benefit of being built on the chassis of the [[M24 (Family)|M24 Chaffee]], it can be used to flank and demolish ground targets. Fighting air targets with the M19 may prove more difficult than previous Japanese anti-aircraft vehicles: offering 40 mm auto cannons, the fire rate is diminished but is exchanged for increased shell velocity and single shell damage potential that can shred planes with a single hit.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)

{| class="wikitable"

! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 10 mm thick while tracks are 15 mm thick.

The {{PAGENAME}} is so lightly armoured that it is very vulnerable to nearby ammorack detonations, bomb blasts and even heavy MG fire can reliably penetrate the vehicle from beyond 1,000 m.
As the {{PAGENAME}} has an open-topped turret, gun servants are also very exposed to MG fire, artillery strikes and plane strafings.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

'''Notes''':

* Ammunition is modelled as 44 clips of 8 rounds
* The visual discrepancy concerns the total number of rounds: 312 rounds are modeled but you can pack 352 rounds.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
