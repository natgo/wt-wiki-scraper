== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
One of the primary M1A1 variants used by the USMC (US Marine Corps) was the HC, or Heavy Common variant. The biggest upgrade this variant has is the AN/VLQ-8A Softkill APS system mounted on the roof, which no other mainline Abrams variants get. One such example of the M1A1HC is the real tank named "Click-Bait". The tank was made somewhat notorious in online circles after an image of the tank with a plastic lawn chair surfaced on the internet during one of its combat deployments.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]]. Besides the chair on the roof, the Click-Bait is differentiated from the normal tech tree [[M1A1 HC|M1A1HC]] with the kill marks on its gun, which accurately title some of the vehicles it has destroyed in combat. The M1A1HC seats itself as the chairman of the top tier premium tank selection for the US tree. Players playing the Click-Bait should take a seat (preferably not in the chair on top of the tank) as they use their mobility to move to advantageous spots in combat and their great reload rate to quickly finish off opponents who did not succumb to the first shot.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful and versatile ammunition selection between kinetic sabots, HEATFS, and a proximity-fused round
* Has an active protection system that can provide some protection against older ATGMs
* Has better turret protection than older versions of the Abrams

'''Cons:'''

* Has a big weak spot under the cannon breech and also the turret ring
* No commander's sight
* The softkill active protection system is visible through night vision devices
* The antennas are tall can can easily be spotted by an enemy
