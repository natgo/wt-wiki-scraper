== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

The {{PAGENAME}} is a modification to the preceding [[M1A1 Abrams]] with features requested by the United States Marine Corps. The designation M1A1 HC, which stands for "'''H'''eavy '''C'''ommon", is to indicate the M1A1's "commonality" of features as the M1A1 HC was used by both the US Army and the US Marine Corps.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
The armour of the M1A1 HC is a drastic improvement from its predecessor. Like the succeeding M1A2, the M1A1 HC has 2nd generation depleted uranium (DU) inserts in the turret, making the turret practically impervious to most attacks. It also retains the same crew layout of its predecessors along with the blowout ammo rack, meaning it is quite survivable. The hull remains unchanged however, and due to the increase in BR, most enemies will be able to penetrate it even at long range.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

==== Ammunition ====
The M1A1 HC is armed with the same 120 mm M256 smoothbore gun as the M1A1 and has access to the same ammunition of APFSDS and HEATFS. However, the M1A1 HC also gets access to a new HEATFS shell, M830A1. The M829A1 APFSDS round is an excellent anti-tank munition, boasting high penetration figures, at 598 mm of flat penetration at point-blank and decreasing to just 560 mm at 2 km. Its angled performance is also excellent, penetrating 346 mm of armour at 60 degrees point-blank and 324 mm at 2 km. It is sufficient to reliably engage any vehicle in the game frontally. The M830 HEATFS shell penetrates a meagre 480 mm of armour. It is not recommended to use this shell after unlocking the M829. The M830A1 is a special type of HEATFS round. Instead of using a conventional impact fuse, M830A1 is a sub-calibre HEATFS round that has been saboted into a 120 mm casing and fitted with a proximity fuse. This allows it to effectively engage low flying aircraft and helicopters up to a range of 4.5 km. The sub-calibre nature of the round means it travels extremely quickly at 1,400 m/s. However, its effectiveness against armoured vehicles is limited as it penetrates a mere 350 mm of armour.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
The M1A1 HC is essentially the [[M1A2 Abrams|M1A2]] without the CITV but with a soft-kill active protection system (APS) that is only useful against early missiles but useless against laser-guided missiles like Hellfires or Vikhrs. The M1A1 HC also has good acceleration which allows for flanking manoeuvres. Due to its increased turret protection and better APFSDS round, it is also suited for sniping at long ranges especially when hull down. With a higher BR than its predecessor, it faces tanks that have no problem penetrating its hull necessitating proper utilization of hard cover found in maps. Its M829A1 round allows it to more comfortably engage targets at range and penetrate armour more reliably up close.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful and versatile ammunition selection
* Has an active protection system that can provide protection against some ATGMs, also comes stock
* Better turret protection when compared to the M1A1
* M829 is a Tier I modification, with NVDs being Tier III
* Carries 4 charges of smoke grenades (4/16 compared to the 6/12 carried by its brothers)

'''Cons:'''

* No commander's sight
* APS is visible through night vision devices and cannot intercept modern ATGMs

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

===Development & Procurement===
Though the [[M1 Abrams]] became accepted into service of the United States Army in November 1981,<ref name="Green_Abrams1">Green 2015, Loc 241 of 1808</ref> the United States Marines Corps (USMC) were not able to immediately look into procurement of the Abrams tanks due to budget constraints. It was not until February 1985 that Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Paul Kelly sought to officially replace the [[M60A1 (AOS)|M60A1]] in USMC service with the [[M1A1 Abrams]], with plans for 490 M1A1 to replace 760 M60A1 beginning in November 1990.<ref name="Green_Abrams2">Green 2015, Loc 1187-1201 of 1808</ref>
[[File:M1A1 HC V18 amphibious assault 130519-M-DA099-026.jpg|x250px|right|none|thumb|A USMC M1A1 HC in an amphibious exercise. The ability of the M1A1 to accept a deep water fording kit, a feature the USMC requested, is an indicator of a "Heavy Common" variant.]]

The USMC's plan to acquire the M1A1 (or the M1A1 {{Annotation|HA|Heavy Armor}} model with {{Annotation|DU|depleted uranium}} armour since October 1988<ref name="AFVDB_Abrams">Conners 2021</ref>) also requested design changes to the tank to fit the USMC's needs. These requests culminated to eighty engineering changes, such as deep-wading adapters for fording kits, stronger chain tie-downs, and a position location reference system.<ref name="Green_Abrams2" /><ref name="AFVDB_Abrams" /><ref name="Zaloga_M1vsT72">Zaloga 2009, Loc 908-916 of 1274</ref> Instead of producing this modified Abrams tank just for the USMC, {{Annotation|GDLS|General Dynamic Land Systems}} integrated these changes into the overall M1A1 HA production lines beginning in November 1990. These new M1A1s were not distinguished by the service branch, being sent to both the US Army and US Marine Corps. As such, the US Army began referring to the M1A1s produced after November 1990 as the '''M1A1 HC''', with '''HC''' for "'''H'''eavy '''C'''ommon" in reference to the commonality of the M1A1 HA tank design between the service branches. The USMC came to referencing the tank as the '''M1A1 Common''', while referring to any pre-November 1990 builds of the M1A1 HA as a "Plain Jane".<ref name="Green_Abrams2" /> The primary distinction between a US Army and a US Marine Corps M1A1 HC is the smoke grenade launchers, the US Army uses the M250 smoke grenade launcher while the USMC uses the M257 smoke grenade launcher.<ref name="inetres_smoke">Cooke 2008</ref>

Though the USMC requested for 490 M1A1 HC tanks, they would only receive 269 units by the delivery end date of 1992.<ref name="Green_Abrams2" /> An insufficient number for their needs, the USMC would receive additional support from US Congress between 1994 to 1995, which allocated enough funding for the transfer of 134 M1A1 tanks from the US Army. As these were "Plain Jane" M1A1 HAs, an upgrade program was started between 1995 to 1997 to apply "Common" design changes into the "Plain Janes". Another transfer would occur in between 2002 to 2005 for 181 M1A1 HA from the US Army to the USMC, which were likewise modified to HC standards.<ref name="Green_Abrams3">Green 2015, Loc 1201-1208 of 1808</ref>

===Combat usage===
The USMC's stock of M1A1 Abrams tank would see first use during the 1991 Gulf War. However, their primary tank deployed to the theater was the [[M60A1 RISE (P)]] as they were still procuring and transitioning to the M1A1 tanks. To bolster the US Marine's number of Abrams, the US Army provided 60 "Plain Jane" M1A1 HA to the US Marine's 2nd Tank Battalion while the two companies of the 4th Tank Battalion of the USMC Reserve was equipped with 16 of the newer M1A1 HC. As such, the Abrams made up of 76 of the total 353 USMC tanks in the Gulf War, the rest of which was composed of M60A1s.<ref name="Zaloga_M1vsT72" />
[[File:USMC M1A1 Afghanistan - DIVDSHUB 364427.jpg|x250px|left|thumb|Two M1A1 HC of the USMC in Helmand province, Afghanistan. The front tank has a dozer blade attached. The two large cylindrical antennas on the turret bustle of each tank is for the CREW-1 jammer unit.]]

The USMC's Abrams were committed into action during the ground phase of Operation Desert Storm. 4th Tank Battalion's Bravo Company<!--Zaloga's 2009 source state it was 2nd Tank Battalion's Bravo company (meaning a M1A1 HA engagement), but more recent sources state it was the reserve 4th Tank Battalion's Bravo company--> saw action in the pre-dawn hours of February 25th when a T-72 battalion from the 3rd Saladin Armored Division approached their location.<ref name="Zaloga_M1vsT72combat">Zaloga 2009, Loc 1160-1168 of 1274</ref><ref name="NHHC_Feb1991">Naval History and Heritage Command 2015</ref> The M1A1 HCs, benefitting from their thermal imager gun sights, were able to engage and decimate the battalion, destroying up to 34 of the 35 total T-72 tanks in a span of 90 seconds.<ref name="NHHC_Feb1991" /><ref name="Green_Abrams4">Green 2015, Loc 1214 of 1808</ref> One crew was even credited with hitting seven tanks with seven rounds in about a minute.<ref name="Zaloga_M1vsT72combat" />

The M1A1 HC would continue to see use wherever the USMC deployed their armoured units, such as in Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The M1A1 HC's usage in Afghanistan stand out as the US Army did not bring any Abrams, and the Abrams were present from 2011 to 2013. The tanks deployed to these two operations are distinguished by the fitting of a CREWS 1 electronic receiver/jammer unit, intended to prevent the transmission of electronic frequencies from detonating improvised explosive devices (IED). These are distinguished by two large antennas usually located at the turret rear.<ref name="Green_Abrams5">Green 2015, Loc 1222-1258 of 1808</ref>

===Further upgrades and the Future===
The USMC stuck with the M1A1 HC throughout its service life, lacking the budget to upgrade to the US Army's [[M1A2 Abrams]]. However, the USMC integrated several M1A2 and other US Army features such as the Stabilized Commander's Weapon Station (SCWS) and Tank-Infantry Phone (TIP). One unique upgrade the USMC implemented on their tanks was the Abrams Suspension Upgrade (ASU), intended to improve the Abrams' supported weight to 77 tons. A Firepower Enhancement Program (FEP) was also implemented to improve the fire control system and {{annotation|IFF|Identification friend or foe}} recognition.<ref name="Green_Abrams5" />

In 2020, the United States Marine Corps was reorganized under Commandant Gen. David Berger as part of Force Design 2030, with the decision made to deactivate all tank units under the USMC.<ref name="Military_TankGone">Harkins Mar. 2020</ref> The process began in July with 4th Tank Battalion's deactivation and ended in on 21 May 2021 with the 1st Tank Battalion's deactivation.<ref name="Military_4thTank">Harkins Jul. 2020</ref><ref name="USMC_1stTank">Athey 2021</ref> The 452 M1A1 HC tanks in USMC inventory are to be transferred to the US Army by 2023.<ref name="USMC_TankEnd">South 2021</ref> Should tanks be required to support USMC operations in the future, it is expected that the US Army's M1 Abrams can provide the needed capabilities.<ref name="USMC_ForceDesign2030">Commandment of the Marine Corps 2020, 8</ref>
