== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The combat operations of the early 2000s with Operation Iraqi Freedom showcased that the [[M1A2 SEP|M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP)]] still had rooms for improvements. Combat-oriented upgrades such as the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) I and II were first fitting to the M1A2 SEP. However, following the cancellation for the US Army Future Combat System program, it becomes clear the M1A2 Abrams will remain the workhorse of the US Army for the foreseeable future, and work began on the next upgrade for the M1A2 Abrams with SEP V2. SEP V2 incorporated many internal changes to the sights, computers and electronics, as well as a new auxillary power unit. The most notable exterior change was the addition of a CROWS (Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station) to allow the commander to remotely operate the heavy machine gun atop the tank. The '''M1A2 SEP V2''' was accepted into service for the US Army in 2008, equipping all Armor Brigade Combat Teams by 2013.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]]. The primary differences on the M1A2 SEP V2 compared to the preceding M1A2 SEP is the elevated CROWS for the M2 Browning machine gun and the ARAT II explosive reactive armour that can be attached. The extra weight from these non-removable additions put the M1A2 SEP V2 at around 66 tons, reducing the tank’s overall mobility compared to M1A2 SEP. The only characteristic that went unchanged is the firepower, firing the same shells through the same M256 cannon. The biggest plus of the M1A2 SEP V2 is that player has the opportunity of being able to bring two M1A2 SEP into battle without having to use a backup, which can be an advantage for team composition in its own way.

As the [[M1A2 SEP]] (System Enhancement Package) tank came in to become the new standard US Army tank for the turn of the millennia, focus on developing the M1A2 Abrams declined as priority went into the development of the Future Combat System (FCS) that was expected to start replacing the Abrams in 2015. Instead, development steps during the early 2000s were moreso reactionary to the insurgency warfare in Iraq after the US invasion in 2003. Such modifications included IED jammers, bustle rack extensions, armored gun shields for the machine guns, and Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK).<ref name="ZalogaM1A2_OIF">Zaloga 2019, 21-25</ref>

However, as FCS continued to have development problem and would eventually be cancelled in 2009, the US Army realized that the M1A2 SEP would be the main battle tank for the army a little while longer than expected. As such, in 2006, the US Army contracted General Dynamics Land System (GDLS) to begin developing the next SEP version, simply designated “SEP V2”. SEP V2 was primarily an improvement to internal components, adapting the gun controls to accept the latest ammunitions, new processing and memory improvements for the computers, new color displays, new operating system, refurbished engines, new transmission, and a battery-powered auxiliary power unit. For external components, the most prominent change was the implementation of a M153A1E1 CROWS-LP (Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Low Profile) that allowed the commander to fire the machine gun from within the tank’s protection. 
In February 2008, the M1A2 SEP V2 was accepted into service and GDLS would be awarded a contract to upgrade 435 M1A1 Abrams into M1A2 SEP V2 standards, which was fulfilled by January 2017.<ref name="GreenM1Abrams">Green 2015, 150-153</ref><ref name="ZalogaM1A2_SEP">Zaloga 2019, 30-31</ref> The M1A2 SEP V2 remained the primary workhorse of the US Army. It also served as the basis of tests for the hard-kill active protection systems, such as Raytheon’s Quick Kill APS system, the Rafael Trophy system, and a new Modular APS program. In September 2017, the US Army provided a contract for 261 Trophy systems to be implemented onto M1A2 SEP V2 tanks,<ref name="ZalogaM1A2_APS">Zaloga 2019, 35-36</ref> and in July 2022 GDLS was contracted to procure and provide Trophy for M1A2 SEP V2 tanks and onwards.<ref name="DOD_APS">US Department of Defense 2022</ref> 

Work already began on improving the M1A2 SEP V2 further down the service life and in June 2011, a new set of improvements in the form of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) was set.<ref name="ZalogaM1A2_SEP"/> The improvements called for new power generation and monitoring capabilities, utilization of Line-Replaceable Modules maintenance scheme, IED jammers, an ammunition data link for smart munition usage, auxiliary power unit, and armor upgrades.<ref name="USArmy_SEPV3">Givens 2017</ref>  These ECP were folded into M1A2 SEP V3, of which GLDS was contracted in September 2012 to develop, with the first M1A2 SEP V3 begin deliveries in October 2017. <ref name="ZalogaM1A2_SEP"/>

A further development of the M1A2 Abrams started in 2022 as the M1A2 SEP V4 with the first prototype arriving at Fort Hood for the 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Brigade Combat Team in 1st Cavalry Division. The SEP V4 was supposed to introduce a new commander and gunner primary sight, both with new laser range finders, thermal imagers, and video cameras; a new meteorological sensor to collect weather data, new communication and data sharing systems, and an upgrade to the ammunition data link for the upcoming XM1147 Advanced Multi-Purpose (AMP) round.<ref name="TWZ_M1A2SEPV4">Trevithick 2022</ref> However, SEP V4 was officially cancelled in September 2023 as the US Army announced a change in focus in improving the Abrams combat capability for the future with the development of the M1E3 variant.<ref name="USA_M1E3">US Army Public Affairs 2023</ref>
