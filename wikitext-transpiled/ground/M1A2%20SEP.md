== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

The M1A2 SEP (System Enhancement Package) is an upgraded [[M1A2 Abrams]]. Its most significant upgrades is the better thermal sights for not only the gunner and commander, but also the driver as well who previously only had access to night vision devices. Another difference of the {{PAGENAME}} from previous Abrams is the TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit) modification, which adds explosive reactive armour on the tank sides to protect against chemical warheads.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

In terms of armour, the M1A2 SEP has the same protection as its predecessor from the front, the tank has used depleted uranium composite armour behind the turret cheeks of the tank, as with previous Abrams the turret's overall kinetic energy protection ranges between 680 mm to 780 mm and the chemical energy protection ranges between 1,000 mm and 1,200 mm. As with previous Abrams the M1A2 SEP retains the same weak spots as the M1A2's hull because it doesn't use depleted uranium in the lower front plate as well as the turret ring and breech being weak spots.

The improvements in M1A2 SEP from previous Abrams is that it has from the sides of the hull as it can use the TUSK kit (ARAT ERA) which provides 20 mm kinetic energy protection and 450 chemical energy protection, this will improve protection from ATGMs and HEAT-FS rounds.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The M1A2 SEP uses 1,519 horsepower AGT-1500 gas turbine like previous Abrams variants, the tank has gained an additional 0.5 tons of weight from M1A2, putting the total mass of the tank at 62.2 tonnes. This causes a slight change from M1A2 which means that commanders should expect the vehicle to respond a bit slower to movement commands compared to previous modifications. However, the tank retains the same 68 km/h top speed and 40 km/h reverse speed as the M1A2 and is still fairly mobile. Without upgrades, the hull traverse is slow and acceleration is lacking as with previous Abrams, however those issues can be remedied by upgrading the tracks, filters, engine and transmission modifications.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|M256 (120 mm)}}

The M1A2 SEP is armed with the 120 mm M256 smoothbore gun which can also be found on the M1A2, the M1A1 and the M1A1 HC, and has access to the same APFSDS and HEATFS ammunition as the M1A2.

As with the previous Abrams tanks, the M1A2 SEP's gun handles very well, with an excellent stabilizer that can be used to accurately fire at any speed and having a quick turret traverse. The gun has good depression and elevation angles which are the same as previous Abrams; negative 10 and positive 20 degrees respectively. An aced crew can reload the gun in six seconds which is the same as previous Abrams, on par with the Leopard 2s but slower than the Challenger 2s, Type 90s, TKX, and Type 10.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Depleted uranium composite armour layout in the frontal turret cheeks makes it extremely resistant from most munitions in the game
- The M830A1 HEAT-FS shell can be effective at destroying helicopters and aircraft through proximity detonation
- 2nd generation thermal sights for the commander, gunner and driver; an upgrade from previous Abrams series tanks
- Like with other Abrams series tanks, it has good crew survivability
- M829 APFSDS modification unlocked at tier 1
- Powerful M829A2 APFSDS shell with excellent ballistics and penetration properties
- Optional TUSK kit is available on the M1A2 SEP, coating the tank in ERA on the hull sides and increasing its chemical protection as well as adding an additional .50 cal HMG over the gun mantlet that can be fired by the gunner similar to Israeli MBTs

'''Cons:'''

- Numerous weak spots in the armour layout:
  ** Large and poorly armoured turret ring
  ** Hits to the highly angled upper frontal plate will likely cause the incoming shell to ricochet into aforementioned poorly armoured turret ring, creating a massive weak spot exploitable even by low rank 5 tanks
  ** Like with most high-rank MBTs, the gun mantlet is poorly armotred and creates an easy way to disable the cannon breech
  ** The lower front plate is huge and has poor protection (~400 mm protection)
- The engine deck is slightly raised, meaning that the gun cannot be depressed over the rear of the tank
- High penetration APFSDS shells such as the Leopard 2A6's DM53 can still penetrate the turret cheeks at short ranges and at the right angle
- The M1A2 SEP is the least manoeuvrable Abrams in the game due to its weight of 62.2 tons, with an additional 3.25 tons of weight if the TUSK kit is equipped
- The stock HEAT-FS shell is very difficult to use at top rank battles as nearly all tanks the M1A2 faces has high levels of chemical protection and/or is coated in ERA. This leaves flank shots as the only option to deal damage, which in itself isn’t the most reliable due to many tanks having high all-round chemical protection

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In September 1994, just one month prior to the delivery of the first M1A1 HC, which would subsequently evolve into the M1A2, General Dynamic Land Systems was awarded a contract to conduct studies on the development of a modernization package for the upcoming M1A2. The work was intended to study the possibilities of equipping the M1A2 with the latest technology in the areas of firepower, protection and digital assets.

Becoming known as the System Enhancement Package (SEP), the upgrade was envisioned as a whole new production standard for newly produced units as well as being a refit for previously built ones. In 1995, the requirements for the upgrade package were formulated and the production contract was awarded to General Dynamic in 2001, with production lasting up until 2004.

While the M1A2 SEP was still in production, experiences from the US Invasion of Iraq unveiled in 2003 the vulnerability of tanks in urban combat environments. In response to this, American engineers designed the 'Tank Urban Survival Kit' (TUSK). It used readily available components to provide a substantial protection upgrade for M1 Abrams tanks, which could be flexibly fitted onto the vehicles by troops in the field, depending on mission requirements. In 2006, a total of over 500 of such kits were ordered and by 2008 all of the M1 Abrams stationed in Iraq were fitted with this modification.
