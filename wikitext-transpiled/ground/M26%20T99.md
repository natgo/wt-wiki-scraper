== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium tank introduced into War Thunder in [[Update 1.53 "Firestorm"]]. The vehicle is essentially a [[M26|M26 Pershing]] tank equipped with rocket pods on both ends of the turret. With a total of 44 [[M8]] rockets, players have more firepower options aside from the [[M3 (90 mm)|90 mm M3 gun]], allowing for quick follow-up attacks while the 90 mm reloads.

Though the [[M26|M26 Pershing]] brought a new level of firepower and protection for American tankers in the late end of World War II in Europe, there was a perceived need for additional firepower to be attached to the vehicle. Perhaps inspired by the [[Calliope]] based on the [[M4|M4 Sherman]], the M26 upgrade was done by attaching T99 rocket launcher pods on both sides of the turret that can hold a total of 44 rockets. This modified M26 was tested at Aberdeen around December 1945, after the conclusion of World War II. With not much mentions of the tank after this testing period, the M26 with T99 launchers was presumably caught up in the post-war military budget cuts and cancelled.

'''Notes''':
* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 9 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 10 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 9 - 1 - 2 - etc. until 8.
* If you pack 17&nbsp;''(+53)'' shells, it will keep most of the hull empty of ammo.
* Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready rack 9.  If the ready racks is empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-8 into rack 9. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
* 1 shell from rack 2 remains in the rack until it is fired after rack 7 is emptied. For the purpose of clarity, it is counted as belonging to rack 7 in the table above.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Even being designated as a medium, the Pershing can perform in many different roles in battle. It can be used for supporting allied tanks with long reload time as [[IS-2]]s, [[T32]]s, etc. Participate in flanking manoeuvres — the M26 speed and agility is not brilliant but enough for that — and be successful in sniping and ambushing situations. Use the lower profile of Pershing compared to the Sherman's to navigate through. The vertical guidance (-10°/20°) allows the M26 to shoot from upper positions without exposing too much of the tank. That's an advantage compared to Russians which have many ground depression problems.

The 90 mm M3 gun owns a wide selection of ammunition to be used. The M82 APCBC with 200 g of explosive filler is extremely deadly. Usually, successful penetration with this shell can lead to a quick end to the enemy. It lacks a bit of penetration for the rank this vehicle sits, but it's great for flanking shots. The M304 HVAP shot, gives the vehicle the ability to penetrate thick armour, mind the APCR/HVAP has poor slope characteristics. This means these need to aim for flat armour. Against a [[Tiger II (H)]], this means aiming for the turret on the gunner side. At that position, the M26 can penetrate out to distances of 1,800 m.

Although moderately armoured for a medium tank class, most enemies can easily destroy the M26 at this rank. A safe playstyle is a must. To reduce direct impacts in frontal engagements angle the Pershing, the V-shape frontal armour can deflect some shots. The lower glacis is a very good target, try to keep it hidden from the enemy. One down side to the Pershing is the engine. The power to weight ratio is poor and does not allow for very quick manoeuvring. It uses the same Ford GAF that can be found in the late series M4 Medium tanks, with nearly 8 tons more weight. Being slightly underpowered, the Pershing has a hard time climbing hills. Good knowledge of maps and areas of operation will help immensely, so use them wisely.

Urban maps (Poland, Eastern Europe, Hürtgen Forest, Cologne) are perfect for ambushing, use the tank's moderate speed to catch off-guard heavier enemy tanks. Drop artillery in front of suspected enemy positions if the M26 need to cross a street and relocate, the [[Smoke screen|smoke screen]] will cover the M26.

If the {{PAGENAME}} has been able to flank an enemy, the first shot is decisive. Always shoot the breech to knock out the gun. The best ammo to do this is M304(APCR) round, or M82(APCBC). M304 will guarantee a 100% successful shot, M82 can also work very good and might destroy everything inside the turret. But some Germans have tracks in the hull sides and if the enemy saw the M26 and is turning the turret, the M82 could bounce off the turning turret armour. Most importantly, don't miss.

The large sides of German heavies are tempting targets but are very easy to overpenetrate with the wrong ammo like the T33(APCBC) or M304.

If flanking an SPG like the Jagdpanther, Jagdtiger or Ferdinand, just aim for the engine, and the vehicle is basically down for easy picking.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''
* Armament:
** The 90 mm gun is adequate for most contemporary tanks it will face
** Gets 44 M8 rockets, which can be used to blind other tanks in a pinch
* Armour:
** Armour does not differ at all from the regular Pershing
* Utility:
** Can be used as a backup for the regular M26
** Does not require any significant learning curve to operate, can be used just as the normal M26 would

'''Cons:'''
* Survivability:
** Rocket pods create external (and unarmoured) ammunition racks
** Frontal hull armour on the Pershing has relatively little sloping
* Armament:
** 90 mm gun lacks penetration to take on tanks frontally
** Rockets are not very effective at destroying tanks

In 1944, the main tank development in US Ordnance was the ''T26E1'' tank, which would later become the [[M26|M26 Pershing]]. The M26 was made into many different variants in the hope it could fulfil multiple roles. One variant hoped to increase the M26's firepower with the addition of rocket launchers, in a manner similar to the [[Calliope|T34 Calliope]] on the Shermans. The rocket launchers were attached on M26 serial number 2011, the 250th of its kind made from Detroit Tank Arsenal. The rocket launcher attached was the ''4.5-inch multiple rocket launcher T99'', consisting of two racks on both sides of the turret, carrying a total of 44 rockets for use. The rocket launchers were traversable by the same turret controls for the main 90 mm gun. The T99 launchers were mounted on trunnions and could be jettisoned from inside the tank when empty. Settings for rocket firing came at one at a time, two at a time, and a full salvo dump. The last of these settings can fire all 44 rockets within 7 seconds.<ref name="PershingHunnicutt">Hunnicutt, R.P. ''Pershing: A History of the Medium Tank T20 Series'' U.S.A.: Feist Publications, 1971</ref> The design was informally called '''M26 T99'''.

Testing with the M26 with the T99 commenced in sometime in late 1945 at Aberdeen Proving Grounds.<ref name="PershingHunnicutt">Hunnicutt, R.P. ''Pershing: A History of the Medium Tank T20 Series'' U.S.A.: Feist Publications, 1971</ref> However, the tank apparently did not seem to have any interest like no other mention of it is made after that. It was presumably cancelled sometime in early 1946.
