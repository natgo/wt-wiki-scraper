=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=406|rbMinHp=232}}

The overall mobility is decent. The top speed is great, easily getting to around 50 km/h on solid roads which is faster than most of the reserve tanks like the [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]] or the [[T-26]]. However, wheeled vehicles like the [[Sd.Kfz. 140/1]] can easily outrun the M2A4 on road. On softer roads like grassland and sand, it remains around 30 km/h which is still quite fast.

The hull traverse brings the overall mobility down quite a bit, since when the tank is still it turns very sluggishly, especially on soft terrain. The hull traverse gets faster when the tank is moving, but in full speed, it starts to snake around like a wheeled vehicle which makes it hard to control. Thus you must get used to this handling.

The reverse speed is only adequate to dodge shots from a distance. Do not expect to quickly reverse back to cover like a [[Sd.Kfz.234 (Family)|Sd.Kfz.234]].

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

{{main|M5 (37 mm)}}

The overall firepower is decent at its BR. The main cannon has an adequate penetration of about 60 mm which is more than enough to go through most tanks below BR 2.0, for example, [[T-26]], [[Panzer III (Family)|Pz.III]] and [[Pz.35(t)]]. Although the available ammunition is all solid shells, they still make quite a bit shrapnel when penetrated which is enough to knock out compact tanks like T-26 and Pz.35(t) with a single shot. For larger tanks like the [[LVT (Family)|LVT(A)]], accurate shots pinpointing the crew are required which might be a little hard for new players. The cannon has enough accuracy to precisely knock out the enemy's crew within 500 m. If one shot misses, the reload time of around 3.5 seconds allows quick following shots.

There is a nice stabiliser for the cannon which is a big advantage when exchanging fire, as it allows you to move out of cover and fire (usually before the enemy) without having to wait for your tank to stop wobbling. The stabiliser should be utilised to maximise your chance of surviving and taking out enemy tanks. Note that it only works below 10 km/h, so remember to slow down or it will not stabilise the gun.

Targets like the [[15cm sIG 33 B Sfl]] or [[M3 GMC]] (in mixed ground battles) can be quite hard to destroy, as their armour is thin enough to create little shrapnel, but are also thick enough to stop MG bullets. Against them, you can only rely on you fire rate, accuracy and of course your knowledge of their crew position to knock out their crew one by one. Always go for the gunners or drivers first, if you failed then they can always fight back and knock your tank out with a single shot.

The main cannon is only effective in close quarter combat (usually within 200 m) or against weakly-armoured targets, since the penetration drops drastically as the range increases, plus the small calibre makes the shells easy to ricochet. When encountering fairly well armoured tanks like the [[M13/40 (Family)|M13/40]] or [[H.35]], try and break their gun barrels first or track them. If they are too far away, pin them on the map and call teammates to help.

{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|3}}

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

The machine gun is only enough to destroy poorly protected vehicles such as the [[AS 42]], [[Flakpanzer I]], [[GAZ-AAA (4M)]], and [[GAZ-AAA (DShK)]]. The penetration of around 10 mm is not enough to go through the frontal armour of those not-so-weakly-armoured tanks like the [[SU-5-1]], [[Panzerjäger I]] or [[15cm sIG 33 B Sfl]]. If you are skilled, the two MG can effectively damage low-flying biplanes.

The fixed MG in the hull are useless most of the times, as they have absolutely no traverse. It is very hard to point the hull directly at a target given the poor hull traverse of the M2A4.

== Usage in battles ==

The M2A4 light tank is the reserve tank for the USA. As such, it is very manoeuvrable and fast, being a light tank. However, it has many distinguishing features that make it a forgiving beginners tank.

The M2A4 is most comparable to a cross between a [[BT-5]] and [[T-26]]. The M2A4 has slightly less mobility than the BT-5 while being a larger target and having better armour, like the T-26. The M2A4 also has a fast-firing 37 mm M5 cannon that can fire M74 or M51 shots, as well as the M61 shell.

Its gun has better accuracy than the majority of tanks on its rank, and its APC ammo retains its penetration at most ranges. This ability to hit rapidly from range and still penetrate in part makes up for the somewhat anaemic damage of the 37 mm gun.

Like all tanks of this rank, it is lightly-armoured and can be damaged or knocked out by any other vehicle from almost anywhere on the map. A useful tactic is to make use of its speed by engaging at range and then relocating when enemy presence gets too heavy around you.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

Specific enemy vehicles that bear mentioning are firstly any Germans with the [[KwK38 (20 mm)|20 mm KwK/FlaK38]] cannon, this gun might be small but can have up to 64 mm of penetration, which is enough to go through the M2A4 almost anywhere. These guns can also fire 10 rounds at 280 rounds/min before having to reload the clip, meaning that they will very easily take out your crew before you have a chance to respond. To counter, the best chance you have is to angle your frontal armour which can make it difficult for the PzGr 40 rounds to penetrate. The Soviet [[T-50]] and [[T-126]] are vehicles you will also see commonly, these have fairly thick and angled frontal armour that will prevent you from easily getting through. These tanks can also carry an APHEBC round that will destroy you in one shot with little difficulty, so to counter you should use your speed to attempt to get a side shot into either the turret or engine. If the T-50 cannot move you can outrun its turret and finish it without much difficulty.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Fast and agile
- Acceptable gun
- Fair armour all around
- Machine gun secondary armament allows for flexibility in taking out exposed SPAA and Tank Destroyers
- Roof-mounted .30 cal MG is quite effective at taking out unarmoured aircraft

'''Cons:'''

- Uneasy handling, prone to slide at high speeds
- Quite flammable, even when hitting from the front
- Terrible steering, not adequate under 2<sup>nd</sup> gear
- Driving this straight into a wall at a fast speed can result in a crew knock out
- Can struggle to destroy larger vehicles due to lack of explosive filler
- One of the weakest tank in the USA lineup
- Easily penetrated by others
- While fast on flat ground, it has problems with climbing steep hills
- Becoming immobilised renders tank as sitting duck, easily eliminated

===Development===
The '''M2 Light Tank''' series was an American pre-World War II design as their answer to a fast, effective tank in a cavalry role.

The idea of light tanks started with the Defense Act of 1920, which defined tanks as an infantry support weapon. However, multiple theorists brought up the idea of a cavalry role for the tanks to which the British were the first to incorporate with the ''cruiser tanks''. Limitation in American development leads to the establishment of light tanks as the ''combat cars''. The development team soon looked at the tank prototypes ''T1 light tank'' and the ''T2 medium tank'' from which they decided to use them as the basis for the light tank design.

Modifications made onto the experimental tanks including installing the new Vertical Volute Spring Suspension (VVSS) which became the main suspension in future American tank development, made the tanks into the '''M2A1 light tank'''. The main version used before the war was designated the [[M2A2]] and had two turrets, both with a .50 calibre M2 Browning machine gun as their armament. However, the Spanish Civil War demonstrated that this kind of light tank was insufficient for the ever-evolving tank warfare. Revising the armament of the tank, the two M2 Browning turrets were removed and replaced with a turret outfitted with a 37 mm cannon and improved armour. This became the '''M2A4''' and served as the main light tank variant in US service prior to World War II.

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
The M2 series traced its family tree back to the experimental T2s, with the M2A4 ending up the largest and most successful modification. Development began in 1939 after running trials for light tanks designed for infantry support as well as the M1 series. The M2 infantry tank was used as the base for construction, a model that was to undergo significant modification. The turret armour as well as the front end were thickened to 25 mm, capable of withstanding hits by light cannons and high-calibre machine guns. The tank's weaponry was also improved with the installation of an M5 37 mm cannon paired with a 7.62 mm machine gun in the single turret.

Another 7.62 mm machine gun was mounted in the front hull plate, with two more on the sides. An antiaircraft machine gun could be mounted on the top of the turret, and additional viewing slits were cut out of the turret and cupola. Most tanks featured the 360 hp Continental W-670-9A engine, which pushed their top speed to 56 km/h. Several tanks in the series were equipped with Guiberson T1020 diesel engines.

Given that September 1939 saw a spike in orders, the Rock Island Arsenal was no longer able to keep up on its own with the demand being placed on it by the US army. A tender for an additional batch was announced and won by American Car & Foundry. In October 1939 a contract for 329 tanks was signed, though it was soon expanded to 365. The last ten were assembled in April 1941 by Baldwin Locomotive Works, meaning that 375 M2A4s were produced in 1940.

The tanks only saw action on Guadalcanal and other Pacific islands. A few others were shipped to the UK via Lend-Lease and used there to train M3 medium tank crews.
