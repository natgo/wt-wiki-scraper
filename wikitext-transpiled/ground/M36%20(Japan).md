== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' were M36B2s assembled at the Japanese depot of Akabane to be shipped to the Korean Peninsula to fight in the Korean War among US troops. Not meant for Japanese service, a single M36B2 was redirected to the JGSDF for research purposes in assistance towards the domestic tank program of the Japanese, which would eventually become the [[Type 61]].

It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]]. The M36B2 GMC is essentially the same as the [[M36 GMC]], with a few improvements. It has a new muzzle brake and bore evacuator that increase its penetration power. It also has a hull MG, and roof armour that is 6 mm thick. The most attractive feature of this M36 is its HEAT-FS ammunition, which can easily destroy most targets.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour of the turret roof is only 6.5 mm thick, the sides are 17-31.75 mm thick and ammo stowage is only 25.4 mm thick, this makes it vulnerable against attacks from aircraft, artillery strikes, SPAAGs, overpressure and machine guns (namely 50. caliber and above). The M36B2 is notably tall and large for a tank destroyer, which makes it harder to conceal and somewhat limits what type of cover is effective.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Transmission area)

'''Notes:'''

* Tracks are 20 mm thick, bogies are 10 mm thick while the wheels are 20 mm thick.
* Small slivers of 5 mm armour hang off the top side hull armour, giving minuscule protections at those areas.
* Track blocks on the side hull armour allows an extra 20 mm of armour at their locations.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The lacklustre acceleration makes the tank struggle greatly with climbing slopes, hills and limits its manoeuvrability, the engine upgrades only somewhat alleviate this issue.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|M3A1 (90 mm)}}
The 10° gun depression gives the M36B2 the capability to shoot over hills. The reload speed is pretty long with a loaded ready rack, making engagements more dangerous, especially if there is a lack of cover.

The M36 has a roof-mounted M2HB to shoot down low altitude planes. It can also be effectively used against light armoured vehicles to great effect.

In the hull, the radio operator gunner has the ability to use a M1919A4 light machine gun which, other than spotting and against unarmoured vehicles, can't provide much anti-vehicle support.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast speed
* Roof cover to protect from air attacks
* Fast turret traverse
* Carries a powerful gun
* HEATFS and APCBC to fight German heavies and post-war vehicles
* Browning .50 cal to deal with light vehicles and aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* Slow and lacking in manoeuvrability when stock
* Most opponents can penetrate your thin armour with autocannons, guns, and bombs
* Roof armour is 6.5 mm thick, meaning most cannons and rifle-calibre weaponry can knock out the crew
* HEATFS explodes on fences and bushes
* Useless APCR shell
* Stock APBC is mediocre
* HEATFS sometimes requires extra shots for destroying heavily-armoured targets

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

=== M36s in Japan ===
Due to the outbreak of the Korean War, the GHQ (General Headquarters of Allied occupation) ordered Japan to re-militarize, while the US also provided plenty of [[M4A3 (76) W (Japan)|M4A3 (76) W]] and [[M24 (Japan)|M24]] tanks to help Japan form their armed police force, the NPR (National Police Reserve), so more US forces could fight in Korea while Japan could still maintain reserve manpower for defense. Multiple M36B2s were assembled at a depot in Akabane which would be shipped to the Korea peninsula to support South Korean and American forces.

However, the tanks that the NPR received were too big for the average Japanese tanker. In order to replace the obsolete Sherman and Chaffee tanks, Japan got a M36B2 for research purposes to help develop a new domestically designed tank, which would eventually be developed into the [[Type 61]].
