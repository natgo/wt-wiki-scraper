== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened to '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret, gun mantlet, transmission housing)

* The belly of the tank destroyer is 25.4 mm thick.

At its battle rating, the {{PAGENAME}}'s chassis is quite weak, being unable to survive most shots by other tanks. As with all M4A3: the sides are even more vulnerable, their high profile makes them a large target as well. The lightly armoured turret is often vulnerable to ammo rack detonations, with its first stage ammo being stored in the rear of the turret. The {{PAGENAME}} is also an open top, exposing it to aircraft that can easily rip and tear apart the tank.

'''Notes''':

* Shells in racks 1, 2, 7 and 8 are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Shells in racks 3 to 6 are modeled by sets of 2 and disappear after both shells in the set having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 7 and 8 are first stage ammo racks. They total 11 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 7 - 8 - 1 - 2 - etc. until 6.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-6 into racks 8 then 7. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
* If you pack 20&nbsp;''(+44)'' shells, it will keep most of the hull empty of ammo.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The M36B1 is best used as support vehicle or flanker, it is heavily recommended that you play in Ground Realistic battles in this role, as in Arcade battles you'll be at a major disadvantage, due to enemies being able to spot you easier (as your nametag will be visible). At its battle rating, your armour won't be able to withstand much that comes towards you frontally. From the sides you are at your weakest point, experienced players will easily make short work of you by shooting where your ammo is stored. Another weakness is the fact that the M36B1 is an open-topped vehicle, meaning that artillery and enemies attacking from the air will be much more effective in eliminating you. So it is advised that you stick with teammates who are able to withstand hits. For tactics, although this vehicle is not the most mobile in the Italian tech tree, it can still be effective if in the right conditions. Not all is bad however: one of the upsides of this vehicle is the armament. This vehicle has access to a HEAT shell as its top tier round, which will be very effective for most tanks you'll face. With it, you can become a very effective, albeit not very fast, support flanker. If an enemy knows your location and has an operational gun, you should not push out into their line of fire, as they are likely to come off better than you. You aren't the most stealthy, and considering you dont accelerate very quickly either. Therefore make sure your enemy isn't aware of your presence before you engage, this will maximize your survivability and should allow you to stay in the battle for longer. Overall either stick with teammates and support, or flank the enemies and try to take out targets whilst being hidden.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Hard-hitting 90 mm gun, the same one as the [[M46]] Patton
* HEATFS can take on any target, even frontally
* Good mobility overall
* Angling can bounce some lower tier shots
* Best frontally armoured and most powerful variant of the M36

'''Cons:'''

* The armour on the Sherman chassis is thin for the rank
* Open turret makes it vulnerable to strafing planes and artillery shells

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In September of 1942, the US Army had begun to equip its specialized departments to bolster their fight against German tanks, with the new self-propelled M10 armed with a powerful 76 mm M7 cannon, although it was evident that the evolution of armour from the opposing tanks would soon force the US Army to equip itself with a new vehicle armed with a much more powerful cannon. The ideal candidate for this new role was the 90 mm M1 anti-aircraft gun, so in April 1942 the first prototype of the new vehicle was built based on a turret mounted directly on the hull of an M4 tank and armed with this gun. To evaluate the installation on an armoured vehicle, two examples of the M1 cannon were modified, subsequently this new weapon was standardized with the provisional abbreviation T7 to which became the M3 model. One of these two guns would be mounted on the prototype of the self-propelled M10 in order to evaluate the possibility of converting part of the production of this vehicle, and in fact no particular problems arose that suggested the opposite. However, it was decided to evaluate the possibility of creating a new turret because the M10 turret presented many balancing problems that made it difficult to continue using it. The task of making the new turret was entrusted to Chevrolet.

On December 9, 1942, the vehicle was standardized as "90 mm Gun Motor Carriage T71" when based on the hull of the self-propelled M10A1 (equipped with the Ford GAA petrol engine) and "90 mm Gun Motor Carriage T71E1" when based on the hull of the self-propelled M10 (equipped with the General Motors 6046 diesel engine made by combining two GM 6-71 commercial engines). In 1944, of these models, only the first was standardized which ended up becoming the "90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36", due to the fact that the US Army was only willing to equip itself with petrol-powered tanks. The M36B1 version also first appeared in 1944, mounting the turret of the M36 on the hull of the M4A3 tank. The production of the M36 was continued up until December of 1944 when it ceased, with an estimated total of 1,400 units being made. In May 1945, due to the continuous demand of troops in Europe, the assembly line was reopened. Unfortunately due to the lack of M10A1 hulls, ones originating from M10 had to be used instead, therefore the M36B2 version was born which would be built in 672 units.

In Italian service, most of the M36B1's would be given by America under the "M.A.P" (Military assistance Program), since post-war Italy was scavenging for any military vehicles they could get their hands from. In some instances they managed to bring back several versions of Semoventes to reuse. Due to the M36B1 being used in limited numbers, there's not much documentation on their use, but they would likely have been on the frontlines if the Soviet Union had ever decided to actually invade.
