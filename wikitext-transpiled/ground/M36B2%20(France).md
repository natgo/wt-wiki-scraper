== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Transmission area)

'''Notes:'''

* Tracks are 20 mm thick, bogies are 10 mm thick while the wheels are 20 mm thick.
* Small slivers of 5 mm armour hang off the top side hull armour, giving minuscule protections at those areas.
* Track blocks on the side hull armour allows an extra 20 mm of armour at their locations.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''T33''': APBC; a solid shot with an average penetration power and no explosive filler.
* '''M71''': HE; useful for destroying open-topped and lightly-armoured vehicles.
* '''M304''': APCR; a composite round with a very high penetration power but no explosive filler and will only penetrate flat vertical surfaces.
* '''M82''': APCBC; a capped armour-piercing shell with a ballistic cap that has a better but still average penetration power and an explosive filler. It will destroy any armoured target it penetrates.
* '''M348''': HEATFS; a HEAT round with very high penetration.
* '''M313''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|M1919A4 (7.62 mm)}}

The M36 has a roof-mounted M2HB to shoot down low altitude planes. It can also be effectively used against light armoured vehicles to great effect.

In the hull, the radio operator gunner has the ability to use a M1919A4 light machine gun which, other than spotting and against unarmoured vehicles, can't provide much anti-vehicle support.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent ammo selection
* Fast turret traverse speed
* Two mounted machine guns provide effective defence against enemy aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* Thin armour
* Vulnerable to overpressure (chemical shells, artillery, rockets)
* The turret's roof armour is too thin to protect against cannon fire from aircraft
