== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''M36B2''' tank destroyer, formally known as the 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36B2, is an improved modification of the [[M36 GMC]] tank destroyer deployed by the U.S. Army near the end of World War II and throughout the Korean War. The M36B2 shared many traits with the original M36 GMC, including the same armour layout, engine, and main anti-tank gun. Beginning in May 1945, the American Locomotive Company rebuilt 672 M10 hulls into the 90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36B2 variant. In May 1945, the Montreal Locomotive Works delivered another batch of 52 M36B2s. As Germany in World War II unconditionally surrendered in May 1945, this upgraded variant of the M36B2 saw no combat following its introduction. Instead, it was heavily utilized by the U.S. Army and the Republic of Korea Army against Soviet-made North Korean armoured vehicles during the Korean War, which began five years later, in 1950. Because [[M26]] and [[M46]] tanks were in short supply, the M36B2 became one of the favoured armoured vehicles for MAP (Military Assistance Program) transfers.

Introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]], the M36B2 GMC performs extremely similarly to the original M36 GMC. Armoured turret cover shields were added to the M36B2, providing some modest protection against small artillery shrapnel and strafing by small-calibre aircraft machine guns. Despite this, the vehicle remains poorly armoured, leaving it vulnerable to strafing by large-calibre aircraft heavy machine guns or aircraft cannons. For the M36B2 variant, new HEAT-FS ammunition has become available, allowing it to engage strongly armoured enemy vehicles at a significantly greater range with reliability.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (Turret, Hull)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Transmission area)

'''Notes:'''

* Tracks are 20 mm thick, bogies are 10 mm thick while the wheels are 20 mm thick.
* Small slivers of 5 mm armour hang off the top side hull armour, giving minuscule protections at those areas.
* Track blocks on the side hull armour allows an extra 20 mm of armour at their locations.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|M3 (90 mm)}}

The 90 mm M3 is the same gun available for the Super Hellcat, the T25 or the M26 and stays reliably accurate until 800 m distance. Beyond 1,000 m the loss of accuracy becomes a real handicap. The high muzzle velocity of your shells grants you pretty flat firing trajectories and thus helps fire at moving targets from a distance. In that regard, using the "sight distance control" feature can increase your chances of successfully hitting enemy tanks.

The rotation speed of the gun is better than average compared to other tanks at the same rank or battle rating. Which makes tracking a target from a distance an easy task to perform as your targeting process is fast. Elevation and depression angles of the gun are important, allowing you to fire from unusual positions (behind a ridge, from uphill, etc.). Your reload time is similar to vehicles at the same BR, if not a little longer than average. Your recoil is important but not powerful enough to throw your gun off target after firing. Lacking a stabilizer, the tank can't reliably fire on the move.

==== Ammunition ====
The available ammunition allows for engaging all types of targets:

* '''T33''': APBC; a solid shot with an average penetration power and no explosive filler.
* '''M71''': HE; useful for destroying open and lightly armoured vehicles.
* '''M304''': APCR; a composite round with a very high penetration power but no explosive filler and will only penetrate flat vertical surfaces.
* '''M82''': APCBC; a capped armour-piercing shell with a ballistic cap that has a better but still average penetration power and an explosive filler. It will destroy any armoured target it penetrates.
* '''M348''': HEATFS; a HEAT round with very high penetration and excellent performance on angled armour
* '''M313''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 5 and 6 are first stage ammo racks. They total 11 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 5 - 6 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4.
* Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready racks 5 and 6. If the ready rack is empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-4 into rack 6 then 5. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast speed
* Roof cover to protect from some air attacks
* Fast turret traverse
* Carries a powerful gun
* HEATFS and APCBC to fight German heavies and post-war vehicles
* Browning .50 cal to deal with light vehicles and aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* Slow and lacking in manoeuvrability when stock
* Most opponents can penetrate your thin armour with autocannons, guns, and bombs
* Roof armor is 6.5 mm thick, meaning most cannons and rifle-calibre weaponry can knock out the crew
* HEATFS explodes on fences and bushes
* Useless APCR shell
* Stock APBC is mediocre
* HEATFS sometimes requires extra shots for destroying heavily-armoured targets
