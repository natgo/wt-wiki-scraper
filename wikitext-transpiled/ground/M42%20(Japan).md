== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was purchased by the JSDF to replace the aging [[M19A1 (Japan)|M19]] in the 1960s. While the [[Type 87]] was still in development, only a few M42s were bought, due to the high development cost of the Type 87. Even though the Type 87 was adopted in 1987, the M42 stayed in service until 1994 to fill the ranks.

The {{PAGENAME}} was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]]. It is identical in characteristics to the American [[M42]]. Its twin 40 mm Bofors guns and exposed crew make the M42 quite a mediocre anti-aircraft vehicle, with relatively slow-firing guns that make it hard to quickly get a hit, and low protection that any aircraft can strafe to pieces. However, this SPAA is quite fast and can relocate and get to a different position quite quickly.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Armour may as well be non-existent on the M42. Built off the chassis of the [[M41A1 (Japan)|M41 Walker Bulldog]], the SPAA can be penetrated by anything in the game, except for those few tanks armed with only machine guns, of course. In this tank, speed is your armour. A stationary Duster is a scrapped Duster unless you're firing on an aircraft, in which you should stop behind some cover.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=710|rbMinHp=442}}

This tank can go about 72 km/h forwards and -20 km/h backwards. Either way, it's fast. Being built with neutral steering and lighter than the [[M41A1 (Japan)|M41A1]], it should take no difficulty to get out of a situation in a pinch.

{{main|Dual Automatic Gun M2 (40 mm)}}

The M42 Duster is armed with two 40 mm anti-aircraft guns. They have a decent rate of fire and you will seldom have to stop and wait for a reload - more likely, you'll have to wait for the gun barrel to cool down. Against aircraft, these guns are deadly. A shot or two will be more than enough to shoot down an enemy. They are also quite deadly against lightly armoured vehicles, such as enemy SPAAs or light tanks such as the [[M24]], and you can penetrate the side of [[Panther D|Panthers]], too. However, they require direct hits. Against the German and Soviet heavies you are likely to encounter, however these guns will do nothing for you. You will rarely get an opportunity to use the Bofors on another tank, as they simply lack the penetration to do so - 72 mm doesn't get you very far at its BR. However, if you can get the guns to hit, you should have no trouble knocking aircraft out of the sky.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|FI-T*|Fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - These work fine, a hit on an aircraft means instant disassembly for it and still is able to hurt ground vehicles, especially if it is side into the side of a enemy tank.
* '''Mk.II:''' {{Annotation|FI-T*|Fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - These mean bad news for aircraft, what should be used for AA work.
* '''M81A1:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}} - These are the worst belts against airplanes. However, they are able to hurt ground vehicles especially if shot into the side of an enemy tank. If you plan on penetrating tanks, load this and flank, since side shots are almost a necessity.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This tank has no armour, but a lot of speed and guns that do nothing against anything with actual armour. Refrain from attacking enemies that can take a hit from you, unless you like getting a lot of hits and assists. You can roam around the battlefield with your insane speed and act as a scout. Ironically, shooting enemies you know will bounce, you have a reason for it because it makes them show up on the mini-map for all players to see, although it will also expose you. However, you could stay with your teammates and shoot down planes that are harassing them - they will see you, with your open-top and exposed crew, and think of you as an easy target. They know the danger of the Bofors guns but for some pilots, that is a gamble they are willing to take. A good way to lure planes toward you is the act like you don't see them - shoot off at some distant (ground) target, at which the plane will notice you are "distracted" and dive to attack you, where you can show them the error of their ways in the form of the 40 mm Bofors gun.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 40 mm cannons are devastating against planes
* AP rounds able to penetrate up to 72 mm can be used against some tanks' side armour it could face, like the [[M4]], [[T-34-85 (D-5T)|T-34-85]] or [[Panther D]]
* Unsynchronized firing helps to improve the overall fire rate
* Outside from default belts, the other belt options are made of a single type of shell that can be relied on
* Relatively fast vehicle with good mobility due to the [[M41A1]] light tank basis
* Fast turret traverse rate helps track aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* Despite 40 mm cannons and the unsynchronized firing, the overall fire rate is still lower than its contemporaries
* 40 mm AP rounds are not the best AP rounds to use overall due to relatively low penetration; cannot penetrate all-round protected heavy tanks like the [[IS-1]] or [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]]
* Open turret allows aerial attacks and machine guns to decimate the exposed crew
* Very thinly armoured hull, can be penetrated by .50 cal MG rounds
* Is vulnerable to overpressure
* Careless driving can damage the vehicle
* Ammo can be used up rather quickly due to the dual-gun firing, prolonged combat can find the ammo stowage run empty
* Easily ammo-racked due to racks scattered all around the turret, aerial autocannons could set it off if hit

{{main|M42 Duster (Family)|l1=History of the M42 Duster}}

===Development===
During late World War II and the Korean War, the US Army were using the [[M19|Twin Gun Motor Carriage M19]] as their main armoured forces anti-aircraft gun. However, during the Korean War, the US Army decided to phase out their M24 Chaffees and its variants, M19 included, in order to implement newer designs made in the time period. One of these newer designs was the development of the [[M41A1|M41 Walker Bulldog]] light tank. The 40 mm armament on the M19 was deemed effective enough to continue usage past the M19, so the turret of the M19 with the twin 40 mm cannons was taken off the chassis and modified to fit the chassis of the M41 light tank, which had a larger turret ring than the M24 Chaffee. This instalment of the anti-aircraft armament onto the M41 light tank was designated as the '''M42'''. Production of the vehicle began in early 1952 at the General Motors Cleveland Tank Plant and entered service in 1953, replacing the many other self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicles the army was fielding. Production continued from 1952 to December 1959, ending with a total number of 3,700 units. During the production, the M42 was upgraded in 1956 with a new engine and other upgrades common with the M41 light tank, this upgraded variant was the ''M42A1''.

===Japanese Service===
The JGSDF purchased 22 '''M42''''s in 1960 to replace the 35 [[M19]]s which were quickly starting to become outdated. The few models purchased by the Japanese defense force is explained by the high development price of the to become [[Type 87|Type 87 SPAAG]].

Even after the [[Type 87]] was adopted in 1987 within the JGSDF, the M42 remained in service long after until March 1994.
