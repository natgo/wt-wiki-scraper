== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5894-development-semovente-105-25-m43-low-profile-high-power-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]], and was discontinued after the [[wt:en/news/6263-shop-war-thunder-summer-sale-en|2019 Summer sales]]. It was made available briefly for purchase with Golden Eagles {{ge}} during the [[wt:en/news/7955-special-italian-national-unity-and-armed-forces-day-en|2022 "Italian National Unity and Armed Forces Day"]] mini-event.

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick while tracks are 20 mm thick and bogies 10 mm thick.
* The belly is 15 mm thick.
* Mudguards are 4 mm thick.

The {{PAGENAME}} got rid of the biggest vulnerabilities of the previous Semoventi: the vertical armour front plate is now much thicker, the sides were reinforced and the crew is less cramped thanks to the widened hull. However, the poor roof armour and a crew of only 3 are still weak points. Your front plate is also now wider and easier to target. With the BR increase, foes are also better armoured, which slightly tones down the benefit brought by your armour increase.

==== Ammunition ====
The ammunition choice for the {{PAGENAME}} is focused on the anti-tank role:

* '''Granata Perforante da 105''': a capped armour-piercing shell with explosive filler that has a good penetration power and whose explosive filler offers a good single-shot knock-out capability.
* '''Effetto Pronto mod.43''': a shaped charge with high penetration power that does not diminish over distance. This type of shell is very effective on open and lightly armoured vehicles. It will also penetrate thicker armour, provided it is not sloped  and will in most cases require a second shot to finish the enemy vehicle. The long reload time of the gun will be a clear handicap in such cases as the enemy will have time to return fire. Always pack a few HEAT shells as you lack HE shells and a machine gun to deal with lightly armoured vehicles.

Both shells have slow muzzle velocity and will have a curved trajectory. Use this to hit enemies hiding behind a ridge.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

;Combat tactics

The {{PAGENAME}} is best when used as a tank destroyer thanks to its good frontal armour and the good penetration of its rounds, provided you stay at a distance guaranteeing your survivability (800-1,000 m). Although the Leoncello lacks any kind of turret, there are benefits and also some disavantages. At a distance, the Semovente's limited traverse is less a handicap and makes it harder for the weak spots of the vehicle to be hit. The vehicle's primary advantages include its low profile and powerful gun which can easily defeat most enemies it will encounter at range while remaining a relatively obscured target With a maximum penetration of 72 mm at 1,000 m for the APC round and 120 mm for the HEAT shell, the vehicle will have no problem penetrating the armour of most enemy vehicles at the BR. However, the low-velocity 105 mm howitzer makes it difficult to target and hit reliably enemies at long range and the long reload time prevents you from coming quickly with another shot. If you play too close to the frontline, most tanks will be capable of disabling you. Your weak sides will be exposed if you are taken in a pincer move and your long reload time will give enemies the opportunity to get to a better shooting spot or to close the gap between their location and yours. So it is overall vital that you do not get flanked and you always have friendly tanks to aid you whenever you are in trouble.

;Notable enemies include;

* Tank destroyers with long guns that can penetrate from long range like the Marder III, the Marder III H, the Gun Carrier (3-in), the Archer, the StuG III F, the SU-57B, the YaG-10 (29-K), the Chi-Ha LG or the Na-To,
* Tanks with powerful HEAT shells like the M4A3 (105), the Pz.III N, the StuH 42 G, the M4A3 (105) (France) or the Sav m/43 (1946),
* Tanks with APDS shells like the Swedish 37mm gun tanks,
* Frontline tanks with sloped armour like the M4A1, the T-50, the T-126 or the T-34 (1940) or the M4A1 (France),
* Fast and agile light tanks such as the M24, the Sd.Kfz. 234/2 or the Crusader III that can easily flank the Semovente undetected are dangerous threats. Their speed and small size make them difficult to target for the Semovente's howitzer and they can disable you easily at close range, and the Crusader with Shot Mk.9 can easily penetrate the M43 at longer ranges.

;How to defeat a {{PAGENAME}}

* Avoid any frontal encounter. Flank it and aim for the sides of the casemate.
* Wait for it to have shot and be reloading (it gives you at least 10 seconds to act).
* If you're forced to engage the Semovente frontally, be as close as possible to increase your chances to penetrate.
* If you can't disable it in one shot, immobilizing the {{PAGENAME}} buys you time to finish it off. Either shoot the transmission, the driver or the engine to do so. Stay out or get out of its line of fire once it is immobilized.
* When flying an aircraft, target the crew compartment to knock the crew out or the engine bay to immobilize it.

=== Pros and cons ===

* <!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 105 mm gun that can fire HEAT rounds

*Small frontal profile makes the tank easy to conceal and difficult to hit
*High gun depression, can be used to crest over hills while only exposing the more heavily armoured superstructure
*Decent mobility and good hull traverse
*Overpressures most opponents easily with APC

'''Cons:'''

* The mantlet armour can be penetrated by the majority of the guns at its rank
* 75 mm of armour has to be angled to to block shots from most American and British tanks.

* No turret
* Confined interior

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In mid-1942, the Italian Army put out a set of requirements for a new vehicle that could double up as both an infantry support vehicle as well as a tank destroyer, depending on the situation. In response to this, Fiat-Ansaldo and OTO both began developing prototypes around these requirements in parallel.

The two competing designs primarily differed in the chassis choice. OTO picked the newer chassis of the P40 heavy tank whilst Fiat-Ansaldo chose to opt for a newer and larger version of the chassis already in production for their Semovente M42.

This decision allowed Fiat-Ansaldo to complete their prototype much sooner. In February 1943, the Semovente 105/25 M43 was presented to military officials and was soon afterwards ordered into production, following successful trials.

Production began in April 1943, with a planned production run of over 800 vehicles. However, with Italy's industry at this late stage of the war being severely crippled, production was slow and reaching such high production goals was more than unlikely.

Just prior to the signing of the armistice in September, the 30th vehicle rolled off the assembly line. The Semovente 105/25 M43 proved itself in combat during the defence of Rome, where the SPGs successfully engaged German forces trying to retake the city.

After the occupation of northern Italy by German forces, the Fiat-Ansaldo company restarted production of the Semovente 105/25, this time however, for the Germans. Germany only used a limited number of these vehicles under the designation Sturmgeschütz M43 mit 105/25 853(i), of which most were no longer in use by late 1944.

Around 120 Semovente 105/25 M43s were built by 1944, primarily serving with Italian or German forces. By the late stages of the war, only a limited number was still in service and after the end of WW2, the vehicle was retired from service.
