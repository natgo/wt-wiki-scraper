== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]]. Private venture of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann company aimed to bring obsolete M48 Patton tanks to modern standards, this tank is the ultimate evolution of M48 tanks in German tech tree.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The mantlet caps at 480 mm against HEAT rounds and just 209 mm against APFSDS projectiles, nothing to brag about. You are resistant to autocannons and older HEAT rounds, but that's about it. Being based on the M48 Patton hull from the '60s, the hull is able to stop only autocannon fire and only from the front arc, as side shots will get through. Avoiding getting shot is vital to your survival. Sadly, blocky ineffective armour coupled with a tall profile makes this task difficult, if not impossible to achieve. Adopting hull down tactics is a must; on the bright side, your gun can depress to -9° and you can perform well in hilly terrain.

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour (hull, turret)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheel, tracks, and torsion bars are 20 mm thick.
* Belly armour is 38 mm thick in the front half and 25 mm in the rear half.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,550|rbMinHp=884}}

The M48 Super's mobility is average at best. Do not expect to rush favourable positions as most of the light tanks and wheeled combat vehicles will be there first.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Your focus should be on firepower upgrades. After parts and FPE, go for the DM23 round, as most tanks at this rank have either composite armour, ERA or in the worst case scenario both, making your stock HEAT round very ineffective. After that focus on getting thermals, those help you tremendously with finding targets and it is impossible to fight at night without them. Lastly, go for DM33 and laser rangefinder. Those make you a potent sniper and level your fighting chance against most opponents.

The M48 Super mounts a late-generation fully stabilised L7 cannon, which is pretty standard at this rank. It also has access to standard ammunition selection, though one thing to note is that it has the option to equip lethal DM33 rounds, which are the third best NATO rounds available for 105 mm guns (after M800 and DM63).

==== Ammunition ====

* '''DM12; HEATFS''' - Your stock round. HEAT round does not lose penetration with distance travelled. Unlike sabots, it has one downside: given that it is a chemical round, its fuse is highly sensitive in regards to its practical application in battle. With the emergence of composite and reactive armour, it quickly becomes obsolete in the anti-tank role. Requires careful aiming to properly damage newer tanks, though it can hold its own while fighting older tanks, lighter vehicles and low flying helicopters.
* '''DM512; HESH''' - This round was always plagued by a plethora of problems. Low velocity, low penetration, inconsistent mechanics and sensitive fuse make this round gimmicky at best. That being said, with the overpressure mechanic, this round can be used in CQB against light vehicles with devastating effect.
* '''DM23; APFSDS''' - Available as a tier I modification, this round allows you to engage modern tanks more reliably, since it performs better against composite and reactive armour. Penetration is relatively below average when compared to rounds available to your contemporaries, so use it as a stop gap solution until a better round becomes available.
* '''DM33; APFSDS''' - Best round available to your tank and third best NATO round available for 105 mm cannons. It allows you to engage most enemies at your BR at any range reliably. With careful aiming, even higher BR vehicles are not safe. Be of note that this round can easily over penetrate light vehicles such as BMP-2 or SPAAGs, so aiming at vital components is preferred in order to create shrapnel necessary to destroy them.

'''Notes:'''

* Racks 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks.
* The ammunition model depletes every two rounds after most shots but this depends on how much ammo is left.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG3A1 (7.62 mm)}}

The coaxially mounted 7.62 mm MG3A1 is, in most situations, not useful. While being able to "blind" opponents by shooting at their optics, as with any MG, and able to easily dispatch of vehicles with exposed crew that have uptiered themselves, such as the [[M56]], 2 factors really hold this MG back from being truly useful. These are:

* The MG is mounted coaxially, limiting its traverse and AA capabilities (especially against helicopters)
* This MG has very low penetration, as almost any thin armoured plate can withstand its fire

Against some of the bigger and meaner helicopters such as Ka-50, it is simply better to not fire at all in order to stay hidden and not draw attention to yourself.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
While the M48 Super can be played as a regular main battle tank, it works best as a sniper or support tank.

As a sniper, thermals, DM33 round and laser rangefinder allow you to quickly and effectively engage enemy tanks at any range. Using uneven terrain and going hull down, an entrenched M48 Super can shut down large portions of maps for the enemy team.

As a support, stabilised gun coupled with DM33 round can work wonders in CQC. Go with your allies with better armour, let them take shot, and as soon as you see enemy tank fire, lunge forward and send the enemy back to the garage. Your tall profile, which is otherwise handicap, can allow you to fire over friendly tanks without obstruction.

If you are forced to brawl, it is mandatory to make the first shot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Improved in all aspects compared to M48A2-G-A2
* Unlike the M48A2-G-A2 its gun has a two-plane stabilizer so it can fire on the move
* Much better turret protection than the previous M48A2-G-A2 model
* Has a new better transmission and engine so it can go around as fast as a Leopard tank
* Has access to 1st gen thermal vision device for gunner
* Has access to the powerful 105 mm DM33 round

'''Cons:'''

* All the add on armour on the turret is ineffective against APFSDS rounds and ATGMs
* It has a high chance of getting ammo detonation due to ammo layout inside the tank
* Penetrating shots will always take out the gun breech and at least two crews
* It has a large profile compared to other tanks  of the same rank
* Has a large engine bulge at the back so it cant fire from its back at all

'''Development'''

The Super M48 was a private venture offered by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann in the 1990s as a potential upgrade for the M48 Patton that was in service with a number of nations at the time. A total of 5 demonstrator vehicles were built using the M48A2GA2 as their basis. Unfortunately for the Super M48, its creation coincided with the end of the Cold War, which resulted in a surplus of newer American and Soviet tanks which were preferred over an upgraded older tank such as the M48. As such, no nation chose to procure the Super M48 upgrade solution.

'''Design'''

The Super M48 maintained the general layout and basis of the M48A2GA2, with a crew of four. It weighed a total of 53 tonnes and was 6.87 m long, 3.63 m, and 2.9 m tall.

The old engine of the M48A2GA2 was replaced by an MTU MB 837 Ea-500 V12 diesel engine producing 1,000 hp, much more powerful than the old engine. The transmission was also replaced by a Renk RK-304 transmission with four forward and four reverse gears. The suspension was nearly unmodified other than the five return rollers being reduced to only three. The new powerpack gave the Super M48 a top speed of 56 km/h.

The protection of the Super M48 was also improved by fitting a layer of composite material around the turret front and sides. This appliqué armour was modular and could be removed when not necessary or replaced when damaged. A spall liner was fitted to the interior of the vehicle. Four smoke grenade launchers were fitted to each side of the turret for a total of eight. Additionally, new sideskirts were fitted on the hull sides.

The main gun was the L7A3 105 mm rifled gun which could fire APFSDS, HESH, HEATFS, and HE. The secondary armament consisted of a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun and a pintle-mounted 7.62 machine gun mounted on the commander's cupola. 46 rounds of 105 mm ammunition and 10,000 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition were provided.

The tank's fire control system (FCS) was replaced by a MOLF 48 FCS built by Atlas Elektronik. It included a digital ballistic computer, a thermal sight for the gunner with an included laser rangefinder, and an optical rangefinder as a backup. The gun was fitted with a two-plane stabilization system and the gun and turret controls were replaced by an electro-hydraulic system.
