== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.59 "Flaming Arrows"]].

A first glance towards the M48A1 can give lots of similarities towards the [[M60|M60]]. However, there are some aspects that can distinguish the M48 from the M60.

The M48A1 is probably most distinguished first by its rounded turret and gun, with the square-shaped gun mantlet covered by a cloth. The 90 mm gun has a cylinder muzzle brake going in a T-shape while a fume extractor sits only slightly behind the muzzle brake position.

The hull is distinguished compared to the successor M60 with its curved cast shape instead of straight welded plates.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Cast homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret)
- Rolled homogeneous armour (Rear (low), Roof)

'''Notes''':

- Shells are modeled by sets of 2 and disappear from the rack after you've fired both shells in the set.
- Racks 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 23 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
  ** These rack are also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3.
  ** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-3 into rack 5 then 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The M48A1 plays as a general medium tank, acting as a jack-of-all-trades in all of the tank's traits with average armour, firepower, and mobility.

The M48A1 front hull glacis and turret are the strong points of the tank and have the best chance on the tank to bounce off rounds. However, its lower glacis and side armour remain a significant weak point for the tank, so take extra caution when exposing those weak points.

One of the best ways to use this tank when a player does not have access to its HEATFS round is to refrain from using it as a brawler. This is because most of the shells that this tank has in its arsenal, do not have the ample firepower to eliminate most of the targets it faces at its BR. However, since the tank is incredibly mobile, it can be used as an excellent flanker. It can out-manoeuvre most of its medium tank rivals and expose their side armours.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Semi-hemispherical design removes shot traps seen on the [[M47 (Family)|M47]]
- Good front hull armour
- Strong roof armour on the hull

'''Cons:'''

- Quite under-armoured for the rank
- Low top speed
- The APCR shot is the stock round
- The HEATFS round suffers from poor post-penetration damage
- Turret roof armour is thin, allowing penetration by heavy machine guns in air attacks
- Cupola weak spot: even small-calibre APHE shells can penetrate it and knock out the turret crew

===Development===
In February 1951, Ordnance opted for a new tank design to modernize the [[M46]] and [[M47]] in the U.S. inventory. The tank was designated the ''90 mm Gun Tank T-48'' and featured a new hemispherical turret, new hull, and an improved suspension. The new design was also the first to remove the hull machine gunner position in American tanks, reducing the total crew from the usual 5 to 4. Further testing and trials with the T-48 design proved its worth and in April 1953, Ordnance standardized the design as the '''90 mm Gun Tank M48 Patton''', which would be the third in the Patton series, all named after General George S. Patton.

Production started in 1952 with the original M48 models. During the initial production run, several hundreds of the M48s were found to not be up to the standard protection ratings it should be, these were relegated to training tanks as the M48C. The model was developed into the '''M48A1''' with a redesigned driver hatch and commander's cupola that integrates a .50 cal machine gun for the commander to use. Next variant was the M48A2 with an improved power pack and transmission, along with a new rear plate and improved turret control. The M48A1 models improved with the M48A2 specifications in 1959, up to 1,019 were converted and are labelled the M48A3. The last major model was the M48A5, which is an upgrade of the M48 models in the 1970s with a [[M68_(105_mm)|105 mm Gun M68]], up to 2,069 converted. In total, about 12,000 M48 models were produced in all from the time period of 1952 to 1959.

===Combat usage===
The Americans mainly used the M48A3 Patton tanks in Vietnam, with 600 models deployed. Each battalion in the US Army and Marines armed with the M48 Patton had 57 tanks each. The Armored Cavalry Squadrons were initially armed with M48s before they were replaced by the lighter [[M551|M551 Sheridan]]. A flamethrower variant was developed from the M48, which became known as the M67A1 "Zippo". The M48 also strengthened the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces by supplementing their [[M41A1|M41A1 Walker Bulldog]] light tanks. The main armour conflicts between the North and South Vietnamese forces usually involved an armour mix of [[T-54_(1951)|T-54]]/[[PT-76B]] for the North and M48 Pattons/M41A1 Bulldogs for the South. In the conflicts, an incident on 23 April 1972 had an NVA anti-tank force with the new 9M14M Malyutka [[Anti-tank_guided_missiles|anti-tank guided missile]] destroy an M48 Patton, marking one of the early uses of the wide-spread infantry anti-tank missiles. Despite that, the M48s performed favourably in the Southern forces. Even after US forces withdrew from South Vietnam and North Vietnam started the Ho Chi Minh Offensive in 1975, the M48s left in the ARVN hands were able to hold back the assaulting [[T-34-85|T-34]] and T-54/55 tanks, only falling when supplies ran out. After the war, the Americans mainly replaced their main tanks with the [[M60|M60 Patton]].

Like with most of the American equipment, the M48s were supplied to NATO allies across the world to assist in their conflicts. They became involved in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and 1971 in the hands of Pakistan along with some [[M47|M47s]] against India's [[Centurion_Mk_3|Centurions]]. Its overall performance in the conflicts was that they performed very well in the battlefield, only failing due to the poor tactics used by the armour forces. The M48s also saw service in the Middle Eastern conflicts. It was notably used in the conflicts against Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of 1973 in the hands of the Israelis and Jordanian Army. The Israels upgraded their M48s with the 105 mm guns, about 5 years earlier than the Americans, and fight against the Egyptian Soviet-supplied armour. They also saw use in the Lebanese Civil War in the hands of nearly all sides involved. They were also used in Turkey's military in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The M48s were also used in Iranian hands in the Iran-Iraq war against Soviet-supplied weaponry in Iraq's hands. Morocco also received a hundred M48A5 Pattons from America in 1987. One of the most recent conflicts the M48s were used was in the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 when assisting the stranded US Rangers and Delta Force in the city.

The M48s were used by 19 different countries in the world during its service life, of which 9 countries still use in varying quantities. Despite being rather outdated in the later part of the Cold War, which warranted its replacement by the M60, the M48 help supplemented the forces around the world in their conflicts. With many models remain in inventory across the world, it still proves a valuable weapon against countries without advanced anti-tank weaponry.
