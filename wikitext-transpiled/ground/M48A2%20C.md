== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull roof, hull rear - engine vents, turret roof, turret ring)
* Cast homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels, tracks and torsion bars are 20 mm thick.
* The turret ring is 70 mm thick.

The armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is identical to the M48A1. The ammo rack in the turret is removed and the shape of the front hull ammo racks are improved. The front armour is able to handle almost most APHE shells it might face, but struggles against HEATFS and APDS rounds. The lower front plate is a weak spot. The sides are decently armoured, but not thick enough to make angling the hull a valid tactic. Some thin vents on the top of the hull are vulnerable to strafing runs by enemy aircraft, which may cause engine fires. Overall, the {{PAGENAME}} has excellent armour protection for its tier.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled by sets of 2 and disappear from the rack after you've fired both shells in the set.
* Racks 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 27 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
** These racks are also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3.
** Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready racks 4 and 5. If both ready racks are empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 3 into rack 5 then 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
* If you pack 21&nbsp;''(+43)'' shells, it will keep the front hull and the turret bustle empty of ammo.

'''Stock Gameplay:'''

The stock grind of the M48A2 C is problematic since the M332 APCR shot is the only stock ammunition provided, excluding the HE shell. Because of the lacklustre performance of APCR shots against angles, and the limited post-penetration damage it inflicts, players need to aim very carefully. Players may find the most success through flanking, and assisting teammates disable enemy armour. Sticking close to allies is near mandatory, as being caught off guard with the APCR is often times a death sentence. Players should prioritize unlocking the M82 APCBC round immediately, as it improves the tank's offensive capability significantly. Along with the M48A2 C's decent manoeuvrability while stock, flanking with the APCBC shell is a viable, and quite effective, option.

'''Spaded Gameplay:'''

The M48A2 C is a powerful tank. The M431 HEATFS round has adequate penetration, and in the event that a round with higher post-penetration effects is needed, the M82 APCBC is also available. The gun and reload rate are comparable to other main battle tanks of the battle rating, although the M48A2 C relies on its HEATFS round for most situations. The armour on the M48A2 C is adequate, able to bounce enemy shells depending on the angle. The night vision image intensifier equipment and IR lamp can be a big advantage during night battles, but M48A2 C players should be careful not to expose themselves using their own IR lamp. The M48A2 C does not excel spectacularly in any way, but it is an adequate medium tank that is well suited to most situations.

'''Close Range Engagements:'''

The M48A2 C is capable at close range, but it is not exceptional. It has decent acceleration and gun handling, meaning it will do decently. Additionally the armour can prove useful even at close range. The only issue for the M48A2 C at close range is the post-penetration on the HEATFS round. Generally using the APCBC round is more effective at close ranges.

'''Long Range Engagements:'''

The M48A2 C is very capable at long range. The HEATFS round will easily penetrate almost any enemy tank at any range. The biggest issues the M48A2 C will face in regards to long range engagements is the velocity and drop on the HEATFS round. Once this can be accounted for, it will perform very well. Additionally, the armour is even more effective at long range.

'''Gameplay summary:'''

Although the M48A2 C is very difficult to play when stock, it is an adequate frontline tank while spaded. The good HEATFS round gives it a strong position in the German tech tree. The M48A2 C is a true main battle tank, and will perform well in any situation. The one disadvantage the M48 may suffer from is a lack of a stabilizer on the main gun. While most tanks which it faces also lack stabilization, those that have it will have a big advantage over the M48A2 C.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent frontal hull armour, impenetrable UFP for most conventional ammo
* Good firepower
* Good mobility
* Has a commander's .50 calibre machine gun
* APCBC round with devastating high-explosive filler for great damage upon penetration
* Surprisingly survivable, two crew members often survive a shot
* Gun mantlet tend to stop conventional rounds
* More favourable matchmaking compared to other 90 mm armed M48 Pattons

'''Cons:'''

* Difficult APCR stock grind
* Turret armour isn't reliable
* Commander's cupola weak spot
* Ineffective armour in an uptier
* No stabilizer
* Ammunition explosions are common as most of the shells are in the front next to the driver

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In the mid 1950s, West Germany received several versions of the M48 Patton III tank from the US. Of these versions were the standard M48A2 and the M48A2C, the latter featuring the M13 fire control system and lacking the rear track tension roller present on the standard M48A2. Later on, these vehicles would be modified by the Germans. They would receive IR equipment, new storage boxes, and banks of four smoke grenades on either side of the turret face. These upgrades were not performed on all German M48A2s and was thus not standardized, however, the vehicles that did receive the upgrades would be unofficially referred to as M48A2 G and M48A2 C G, similar to the M47 which was unofficially referred to as M47 G after it received a similar upgrade. (The vehicle represented in-game is an M48A2 C G) These upgraded vehicles would see service until the 1970's were it was replaced by the M48A2 GA2.
