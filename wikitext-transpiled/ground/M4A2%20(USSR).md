== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.45 "Steel Generals"]].

The M4A2 (76) W has an unusually high profile and thus it is difficult to drive around undetected. While playing this tank, the M4A2 is an easy target for [[Jagdpanzer_IV|Jagdpanzers]]. However, if correctly camouflaged, it is possible to get the first shot off. Also, the sides and rear of this tank are very poorly armoured. Thus, Sherman's fuel tanks and engine catch on fire very easily.

One redeeming fact of this model is that the ammo is in the centre of the tank so it's harder to hit than in previous Sherman models ([[M4]], [[M4A1]], [[M4A2]], and [[M4A3 (105)]]), but the more powerful tanks like the [[Tiger H1]] and [[Panther D]] can easily destroy the M4A2 even if it shoots first. In addition, they can easily penetrate the frontal armour at almost all ranges and in most cases, if they are using the correct ammo, the shells' shrapnel will knock out the entire crew. Consequently, the best chance of survival is to fight near allied tanks which allow the 76 mm gun to be effective. With two machine guns, the M4A2 can defend itself and the team from enemy aircraft or clear forested areas where German tank destroyers could be.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
'''Armour type:'''

*Rolled homogeneous armour

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The most important modules to research are Parts and FPE. The M62 APCBC shell is superior to the stock M79 AP shot in performance, so researching the M62 shell module is a priority. After that, the player may prioritize either mobility or firepower upgrades, depending on playstyle.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The M4A2 (76) W is a classic Sherman tank. It requires careful positioning and avoidance of enemy fire, possesses an above-average gun, and works best when played around teammates.

As such, it is well-suited to city brawls in which it can use rubble as cover and protect its flanks effectively. The city environment also suits the tank's below-average mobility. In close quarters, this shortcoming will not be too much of a hindrance. That being said, the M4A2 is also a classic medium tank, and highly adaptable. If needed, it can engage at most, if not all, ranges. It can be used to rush a point, or to defend from an assault. Certainly, the powerful cannon is capable against all but the most heavily armoured enemies.

This vehicle has mediocre armour and a highly visible profile, so it must be played carefully if the player wishes to stay alive for more than a few minutes. It is not uncommon for the M4A2 to be destroyed in a single hit, especially when facing the German cannons. Other enemies to watch out for include enemy aircraft: although the roof armour will protect crew members from strafing runs, the vehicle's above-average size makes it rather visible from the air, and makes it a target for bombing and rocket attacks.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Higher top speed compared to the previous vehicle
* Great rate of fire for the main gun
* Angled frontal slope which may sometimes bounce larger calibres if angled correctly
* A standard 5 crew members, which equates to 3 spare crew members to take over positions of the tank if necessary
* A pintle-mounted heavy machine gun (12.7 mm), which can be used for anti-aircraft and against light armoured vehicles
* Wet ammo storage - Which reduces greatly ammo rack chances, is indicated by the "W" in its name, this also means tightly packed ammo only placed under the turret
* Fast turret traverse

'''Cons:'''

* Is quite tall
* Prone to tipping over when travelling across steep inclines
* Sides and rear are thinly armoured
* Engine compartment is poorly armoured
* Susceptible to nearby artillery explosions
* Narrow tracks mean poor ground flotation and cross country performance
* Only reaches its top speed on paved surfaces
* Lacks the add-on armour module found on the 76 mm M4A1 and M4A3
* Unlike the earlier M4A1 (76) W, Cruise Control 1 setting is slightly above the maximum speed that the stabilizer operates at
* Armour might not stand up against common guns like the Soviet 85 mm or the KwK36.

===Lend-Lease===
[[File:Matilda Mk II USSR.jpg|x250px|right|thumb|none|Matilda Mk II tanks in Soviet service.]]
The Soviet participation in the United States' Lend-Lease program started in Autumn of 1941 when the United States and United Kingdom agreed to give military aid. Tanks were of particular interests to the Soviets in order to replenish their Summer losses against Germany during Operation ''Barbarossa''. The first tanks sent were from Great Britain with [[MK-IX_"Valentine"_(USSR)|Valentines]] and [[MK-II_"Matilda"_(USSR)|Matildas]], which played a part in the Battle of Moscow.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_British">Zaloga 2017, Loc 63, 95 of 1264</ref> The United States provided their [[M3 Stuart]] light tanks and [[M3_Medium_(USSR)|M3 Medium]] tanks in late 1941/early 1942 (The two were designated ''{{Annotation|M3L|Legkhiy/Light}}'' and ''{{Annotation|M3S|sredniy/Medium}}'' respectively to avoid name confusion).<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_M3Stuart">Zaloga 2017, Loc 245-257 of 1264</ref><ref name="ZalogaLendLease_M3Medium">Zaloga 2017, Loc 305 of 1264</ref> These American tanks were not viewed with satisfaction, with the head of Soviet tank industry, Vyacheslav Malyshev, even considering stopping all American tank imports and focusing instead on American trucks.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_Trucks">Zaloga 2017, Loc 420-426 of 1264</ref> Despite that, the Soviets were interested in America's newest medium tank, the M4 Sherman, and were eager to obtain some as soon as possible. 

===Shermans in the Soviet Union===
Though the M4 and M4A1 were available, the Soviets disliked the gasoline Continental radial engine due to their experience with the M3 Light and Medium tanks. Instead, they asked for the diesel GMC engine variant M4A2 Sherman upon learning of its existence in August 1942.<ref name="SamsonovRedArmyM4A2(1)">Samsonov 2021, pg 28</ref> The M4A2 had been in production since April 1942, but the time needed for the production to supply the demand meant that the first M4A2 only arrived in the Soviet Union by 21 September 1942.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_M4Intro">Zaloga 2017, Loc 616-633 of 1264</ref> Concern on shortfalls in M4A2 productions caused the Soviets to order and receive two M4A4 tank models for evaluation in 1943. After trials with the M4A4, the Soviet disliked the Chrysler A57 engine configuration and low fuel efficiency compared to the M4A2, and so opted not to receive anymore M4A4 tanks.<ref name="SamsonovRedArmyM4A4">Samsonov 2021, pg 51-55</ref><ref name="TankArchivesM4A4">Samsonov 2013</ref>

The low numbers of M4A2 received in 1943 caused the Soviet Union to field the first M4A2 tanks in small units, with the first of these being the 563rd Independent Tank Battalion in 04 January 1943 with 9 M4A2 tanks and the 5th Guards Tank Brigade with two M4A2 in January 12th. <ref name="ZalogaLendLease_M4Intro" /><ref name="SamsonovRedArmy1stcombat">Samsonov 2021, pg 61</ref><ref name="GillonoUnits">Gillono and Hulbert 2011, pg 23</ref> The first major campaign the M4A2 were involved in was the Battle of Kursk with the 229th Independent Tank Regiment with 39 M4A2 Shermans, which was put into combat on 11 July 1943.<ref name="SamsonovRedArmyKursk">Samsonov 2021, pg 70</ref> As combat experience with the M4A2 grew, the Soviets came to appreciate the qualities and recognize the flaws of the M4A2 Sherman. A report on 23 October 1943 from the 5th Guards Tank Brigade regarding their M4A2 Shermans noted:<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_M4Intro" />

{{Quote
|Due to its high speed, M4A2 tank is very convenient for exploitation, and offers great manoeuvrability. Armament is consistent with its design and it has fragmentation and armour-piercing shells with very high penetration. The 75 mm gun and two Browning machine guns are trouble-free. Its disadvantages include a great height making it a bigger target on the battlefield. Armour, despite the greater thickness (60 mm), is substandard. There were cases when it was penetrated by an antitank rifle at a distance of 80 m. In addition, there were a number of cases where Ju 87, while bombing the tanks, penetrated the side armour and turret armour with 20 mm cannon fire, resulting in crew casualties. Compared with the T-34, the M4A2 is easier to operate, and more durable when making long marches as the motors do not require frequent adjustment. In combat, these tanks are working well.
}}

As the inventory of the M4A2 grew in the Soviet Union, the formation of larger tank units composed of M4A2s was possible. The first of such was the 5th Mechanized Corps (later renamed the 9th Guards Mechanized Corps) which, on 01 January 1944, had a total of 131 M4A2 among the regiments and brigades.<ref name="SamsonovRedArmy5thMC">Samsonov 2021, pg 80-81</ref> The M4A2 in service was given the nickname "emcha" by the Soviet soldiers, which was a contraction of the Russian pronounciation of M4 (M-''Chetire'').<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_M4Intro" />

The Soviets continued requesting more M4A2 Shermans to fill their armies, with 2,000 more expected from July 1943 to June 1944. This was at odds with America's plans to switch M4 production over to the 76 mm gun at the end of 1943. To continue supplying the Soviets, the Fisher Body production lines at the Grand Blanc Tank Arsenal continued to produce 75 mm armed M4s until May 1944 to fulfill the Soviet's order.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_3rdProtocol">Zaloga 2017, Loc 166, 649 of 1264</ref>
[[File:Soviet M4A2 tanks on Krenova street in Brno.gif|x200px|left|thumb|none|Soviet M4A2 (76) W in Brno, Czechoslovakia in April 1945.]]

===76 mm Shermans ===
The Soviet Union's next order of 3,000 Shermans would be for M4 Shermans equipped with the new 76 mm M1 gun.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_76mm">Zaloga 2017, Loc 660 of 1264</ref> These M4A2 (76 mm) Shermans began arriving to the Soviet Union in September 1944.<ref name="TankArchivesEmcha">Samsonov 2017</ref> ​The first combat unit to be equipped with these M4A2 (76) Shermans was the 1st Mechanized Corps in October. Other units that received and used the M4A2 (76) Shermans were the 8th and 9th Guards Mechanized Corps, as well as the 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps.<ref name="GillonoEUUnits">Gillono and Hulbert 2011, pg 17-18</ref>
[[File:M4A2 (USSR) Historical - 03 May 1945.jpg|thumb|right|x250px|none|A Lend-Lease M4A2 (76) W Sherman in Soviet service in May 1945 at Grabow, Germany.]]

The first action the M4A2 (76) Sherman saw in Soviet service in was in December 1944, when the 6th Guards Tank Army and its associated 9th Guards Mechanized Corps conducted offensive operations in Hungary.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_76mm" /><ref name="LozaShermans">Loza and Gebhardt 1996</ref> The M4A2 (76) Shermans would see large-scale usage in 1945 during the Soviet's offensives towards Germany, sometimes alongside the M4A2 (75) versions. Some of the most notable Soviet actions the M4A2 (76) were in the Vistula–Oder offensive in Winter 1945, the Vienna Offensive in Spring 1945, and finally the Battle of Berlin in April-May 1945, where most notably the 1st Mechanized Corps, equipped with 165 M4A2 Shermans prior to the battle, participated in the heavy fighting.<ref name="TankArchives1stMCBerlin">Samsonov 2015</ref> 

The final M4A2 Sherman usage by the Soviet Union was in Operation ''August Storm'', the Soviet invasion of Manchuria against Japan in August 1945.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_76mmUsage">Zaloga 2017, Loc 665-672 of 1264</ref> This offensive saw M4A2 Shermans used on the Transbaikal Front, with the M4A2s in the 3rd and 9th Guards Mechanized Corps, as well as smaller units such as the 48th Independent Tank Battalion and 201st Tank Brigade present (the 201st were held in reserves).<ref name="GillonoUnits" /><ref name="LozaShermans" /> In all, 250 M4A2 Sherman tanks were present in the Soviet forces when the invasion of Manchuria commenced.<ref name="TankArchivesEast">Samsonov 2014</ref> <ref name="TankArchivesHVSS">Samsonov 2018</ref>

===Lend-Lease numbers===
Of the 12,485 tanks and armoured fighting vehicles sent to the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1945 in the Lend-Lease program, 4,102 of those were of the M4A2 Sherman tanks, with 2,007 being of the M4A2 (75 mm) version, and 2,095 being the M4A2 (76 mm) version. Of the tanks sent, the Soviet records reported the receiving of 3,664 tanks; the difference mainly due to deliveries being sunk on the way and discrepancies between the United States and Soviet Union archives.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_Tables">Zaloga 2017, Loc 899-1212 of 1264</ref><ref name="GillonoShermans">Gillono and Hulbert 2011, pg 1</ref><!--Samsonov source states that 3,938 were received instead of 3,664. Awaiting author response to inquiry on the matter.<ref name="SamsonovRedArmyLLNumbers">Samsonov 2021, pg 31</ref>--> Of the 76 mm variants, 460 tanks were versions with the HVSS suspension designs, which began arriving in March-April 1945, delivered too late to see combat in Europe.<ref name="ZalogaLendLease_76mmUsage" /> However, 128 of the tanks saw use with the 9th Guards Mechanized Corps (84 tanks) and the 201st Tank Brigade (44 tanks) in Manchuria.<ref name="TankArchivesHVSS" /> These figures also indicate that the Soviet Union was one of the largest users of the M4A2 (76 mm) Shermans, of which 2,915 were manufactured in total by the United States.<ref name="M4(76)_LendLease">Zaloga 2003, Loc 686 of 977</ref>

Large quantities of military vehicles were delivered to the Soviet Union as part of the lend-lease program. These deliveries made a considerable impact on the Soviet Army's arsenal and played a significant role in the final victory over Germany in WWII. One of the vehicles provided as part of the lend-lease program was the American Sherman medium tank.
