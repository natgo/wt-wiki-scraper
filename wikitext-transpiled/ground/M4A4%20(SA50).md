The '''M4A4 (SA50) Sherman''' is an up-gunned modification of the [[M4A4 (France)|M4A4]], which is the fifth variant of the early-generation [[M4 Sherman (Family)|Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family]]. The M4A4 (SA50) is the result of a joint Israeli-French program in 1954 to enhance Israel's existing M4 Shermans with more firepower to confront the growing threat from neighbouring countries in the 1950s. An Israeli military delegation visited France in 1953 to see the then-new AMX-13/75 light tank, which was armed with the 75 mm SA50 L/57 tank gun. While the tank's main gun was assessed as adequate, its armour was deemed insufficient. The AMX-13 was eventually purchased by Israel, but in a parallel development, it was decided that the high-velocity 75 mm SA50 L/57 tank gun of the AMX-13s Israel purchased would be transferred to the more familiar and better-armoured hull of its M4 Sherman fleet, which was the standard tank family of the Israel Defense Force armoured units during the early 1950s. This project began in 1954, and an AMX-13 turret was transferred from France to Israel in 1955. In March 1956, Israeli Ordnance Corps military facilities began modifying their first 50 tanks of the [[M4A4 (France)|M4A4 variant]] to be equipped with high-velocity 75 mm SA50 L/57 tank guns. The high-velocity 75 mm SA50 L/57 tank gun was known as the M-50 in Israel; hence, the up-gunned Sherman was dubbed the Sherman M-50 (but M4A4 (SA50) as the official designation).

Introduced in [[Update 1.75 "La Résistance"]], the M4A4 (SA50) has been significantly modified to provide far more firepower than the standard M4A4. The salvaged components of the 75 mm Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 42 L/70 tank gun from destroyed German [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther medium tanks]] during the German conquest of France inspired the high-velocity 75 mm SA50 L/57 tank gun. However, when compared to the [[M4A1 (FL10)|M4A1 (FL-10)]], another tank prototype constructed by the French for Egypt, which had an autoloader, the M4A4 (SA50) lacks an autoloader and consequently reloads much slower than the M4A1 (FL-10). Nonetheless, players are sure to appreciate this modification, and there will be few opponents on the battlefield that can withstand the high-velocity shots fired by the M4A4 (SA50). At this rank, however, the M4A4 hull protection is barely adequate; therefore, rather than playing aggressively, it is vital to choose strategic areas early in the battle to set an ambush for the enemies.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
With its sloped frontal armour, many low-calibre shells will just bounce off the Sherman, though any actual anti-tank gun you will face at this BR will easily go through this relatively thin armour at medium range. Keep in mind not to linger too long in front of SPAAs as there are two very convenient flat plates in front of the driver and machine gunner which can possibly be penetrated by AA's of the BR. As for the turret, some angles may deflect shots but don't count on it. Side and rear armour plates are vulnerable to anything bigger than HMG rounds since they are only 38 mm thick. In conclusion, this armour is there to provide occasional protection from poorly aimed shots and autocannon fire, but nothing more.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret, gun mantlet, cupola, transmission carter, MG port)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The Sherman chassis, with all its good and bad attributes carries this tank around on the battlefield. It will carry its user wherever it likes but it takes some time to do so; don't count on it for hasty retreats as both reverse speed and hull turning are slow when this tank is stopped. As long as it is not required to do back-flips and drifting, this chassis does it's job fairly well.

The Sherman's turret was not made for such a huge gun. This is why this tank has an elongated mantlet: to provide space for the long SA50 L/57 cannon. Originally, this tank was provided with a vertical stabiliser but it was disabled with this new gun mount as the strain was too great for this piece. Thus, unlike most Shermans, the French M4A4 SA50 does not have a stabilized gun; this however is more than made up for by the egregious penetration rates of the high-velocity cannon. This main armament performs a bit better than its British counterpart, the [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder (76 mm)|QF 17-pounder]], as it has superior penetration rates at all ranges. With such a gun, sniping is an easy task as only [[Panther D|early Panthers]] will be able to bounce an incoming round (they still have weak spots, though).

With this great amount of firepower come some downsides however: it is not stabilized which makes target acquisition quite slow and the lack of explosive filler means that you will have to aim each shot to make it count. This specific Sherman's main weakness however is its lack of top-mounted MG, leaving it mostly vulnerable to strafing planes.

Experienced Sherman commanders will like this tank as it drastically increases this old boy's lethality. This tank is a very good representative of the medium tank line, with average mobility, sufficient armour and enjoyable firepower. Get into position, manage to avoid shots doing so and play any role an average tank can fit into: sniper, brawler, flanker, etc.

With good overall characteristics, this vehicle can play many roles on the battlefield. Here are some of them:

'''Brawler:'''

This tank has bad armour for the BR and the tank gives that away very clearly. Using its good turret traverse rate and close-quarter penetration rates, it should blast through almost anything it looks at. This tactic is very efficient in urban combat, where long range precision shots are not required. Do note that only reaction time and situation awareness can save you, as any main gun will make short work of you. Make sure to surprise your enemies while you avoid being targeted yourself. This tactic can deliver you some points if executed well. The most important thing about this tactic is to know when to hold back, as enemies will be aware of a rampaging Sherman in the area and will take advantage of it as soon as they get the opportunity. This is a high risk/high reward type of playstyle.

'''Sniper:'''

This scenario is the most advantagious for the M4A4 (SA50) because the vehicle is very suited to open maps. It can easily dominate the field (especially against tanks of a lower BR) when you employ the right tactics; keep a good distance from your enemy and use your own cannon to penetrate them from any range. Even if your armour is not the best, it should block most incoming rounds which will have lost most of their penetration power at those ranges. Make sure to reposition your vehicle after every 2-3 shots as you may get spotted by a tank destroyer, which is one of the few dangerous foes even on longer ranges. This tactic is even more effective when you are in a hull-down position: unlike Soviet vehicles, this tank has -10° of depression which you can make good use of.

Use your imagination: any tactic that doesn't rely on your armour is effective with the M4A4 (SA50). Supporting your teammates, ambushing oblivious enemies, many tactics are effective with this versatile tank.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent 75 mm gun, arguably better than the legendary 17-pounder due to the penetration and accuracy of the gun
* Outstanding penetration on the default APCBC at all ranges
* Unlike the Sherman Firefly, the SA50 gets 10 degrees of gun depression. Makes cresting ridgelines a good tactic
* Set of optics with 7.5x magnification
* The gun mantlet is both large and V-shaped. Can reliably stop or bounce incoming fire
* Due to all the pros listed above, the SA50 is one of the best pound-for-pound snipers and ridgeline shooters in the game

'''Cons:'''

* Bad overall armour layout: doesn't have any add-on tracks lining the sides like the Firefly
* Doesn't have access to any shells with explosive filler
* Higher-than-average reload time for the battle rating
* No roof mounted .50 cal HMG like on other Shermans at the same BR

===Israeli M4 Shermans===
During the Cold War, the Israelis received stocks of [[M4|M4 Sherman]] tanks to equip their armoured force. They were obtained from the British, French, and scrap yards across Europe.<ref name="ZalogaIsraeli">Zaloga 2008, "Chapter 11: Cold War Sherman"</ref> Their designations on the Shermans were based on their armaments, leading to names such as the ''Sherman M-1'' with the [[M1 (76 mm)|76 mm M1 gun]], the ''Sherman M-3'' with the [[M3 (75 mm)|75 mm M3 gun]], and the ''Sherman M-4'' with the [[M4 (105 mm)|105 mm M4 howitzer]], regardless of Sherman hull and engine model types. Sherman tanks equipped with the horizontal volute suspension system (HVSS) were given the added name "Super" in the designation.<ref name="ShermanTankIsraeli">Jeeps_Guns_Tanks 2015, ''#34''</ref>

The M4 Shermans were seen as adequate in the early 1950s conflicts, but the Soviet arms trade with the neighboring Arab countries in the 1950s caused the Israelis to focus on uparming their existing Sherman inventory. Their program was a 1954 joint venture with France to arm the Sherman with the 75 mm SA50 gun from the [[AMX-13]] light tank. The modifications to hold the 75 mm SA50 gun required the extension of the Sherman turret front and rear to make room for the gun and add a counterweight for the heavier front weight. With the success of this modification, the Israelis chose the 75 mm SA50 gun to be the new armament for the M4 Sherman inventory. The first fifty tanks with the 75 mm SA50 guns were added into a M4A4 Sherman hull converted to use a R975 radial engine by the French, these tanks designated as the '''M-50 Sherman''' by Israel. These used a vertical-volute suspension system (VVSS), but the added weight of the gun inhibited the M-50's flotation and mobility, so this was shifted to use the HVSS and the Cummins diesel engine. These two variants are distinguished by engine type as the ''M-50 Continental'' and the ''M-50 Cummins.'' Other hulls outside the M4A4 were also used in the conversions.<ref name="ShermanTankIsraeli" />

===Combat usage===
The M-50 Sherman was used by Israeli during the 1956 Suez Crisis and the 1967 Six-Day War. The 1956 Suez Crisis against Egypt was a curious case as the Egyptians also send their M4 Sherman inventory through a similar uparm program by adding the [[M4A1 (FL10)|AMX-13 turret onto their M4 Shermans]], giving them their own usage of the 75 mm SA50 gun on the M4 Sherman tanks.<ref name="ZalogaIsraeli" />

Its use in the 1967 war was interleaved with the more powerful M-51 Sherman, a similar upgun program with the French 105 mm Modèle F1 from the [[AMX-30 (1972)|AMX-30]] tank.<ref name="ShermanTankIsraeli" /> Though the early M-50 Continentals were retired by 1972, the
the M-50 Cummins and M-51 served together up until the early 1980s, having to fight more modern Soviet tanks such as the [[T-55A|T-54/55]] tanks in the 1973 Yom-Kippur War. The Israeli gave away several of the M-50 Shermans to Lebanon to aid supporting militia groups in the Lebanese Civil War, in this conflict two were captured by Palestine, which they used against during the 1982 Lebanon War.<ref name="ChadM-50">Chad 2011</ref> About 50 M-50 were given to Chile in late 1980s, rearmed with an IMI-OTO 60 mm Hyper Velocity Medium Support gun, which they used until 1999 when they replaced them with the [[Leopard I|Leopard 1]] tanks. The Israelis cleared their stocks of M-50 and M-51 by this time, sold to collections, used as range targets, or repurposed to other usage such as engineer vehicles.
