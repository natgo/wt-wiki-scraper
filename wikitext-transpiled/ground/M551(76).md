== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Air Superiority"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season XIV, "Airborne General"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

High mobility, around the same top speed and performance of the regular M551. 

76mm Cannon is fully stabilized. 

High turret traverse rate of 27.1/s, mostly on-par with even top-tier MBTs, and faster than many tanks it will encounter. 

Optic zoom is effective for long-distance and "sniping" shots.

*

'''Cons:'''

Unlike the regular version of the M551, the 76mm M551 does not have NVD or the UAV modifications available.

The armor of both the hull and turret is poorly armored against splash-damage from artillery explosions. 

M331A2, despite having decent penetration ratings, has a poor post-penetration effect.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== [[wt:en/news/8700-development-battle-pass-vehicles-m55176-en|Devblog]] ===
The history of the M551 Sheridan light tank started in 1959, when at the request of the US Army, work began on a promising tank to replace the M41 Walker Bulldog and M56 SPG. During the final stages of testing, problems emerged with the 152 mm M81 cannon launcher due to an unreasonable amount of recoil and a gun breech prone to cracking. To address these issues with the M551 which had already been put into production, Allison developed a variant with a 105 mm howitzer by March of 1967, and then with a 76 mm M32 gun which had been used on the M41 Walker Bulldog. However, none of the prototypes received approval from the army’s leadership.
