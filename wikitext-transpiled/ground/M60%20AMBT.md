== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Starfighters"]] as a reward for World War Mode [[Season 3: Road to the West]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour - The main armour of the turret and hull.
* Rolled homogeneous armour - Engine deck and engine compartment rear, additional armour panels (upper and lower glacis).
* Structural steel - Slat armour, fenders, storage boxes.
* Gun steel - All gun barrels.
* Composite screens - Side skirts.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|M256 (120 mm)}}

The M256 is the same cannon that is used on the [[M1A1 Abrams|M1A1]], [[M1A1 HC]], and [[M1A2 Abrams]]. The main item that differentiates this cannon is the round. The M60 AMBT has the "KE-W" APFSDS round which has very high penetration for its BR. The round can be reliably shot centre mass and penetrate most opponents it faces, excluding the top BR tanks in a full uptier. 583 mm at 0° point-blank is an extremely potent round for most engagement ranges you will experience, close to the penetration rate of M829A1 at 598 mm at point-blank range. The AMBT also has access to the M830 HEAT-FS round which can be useful for destroying lightly armoured vehicles and destroying some map obstacles such as buildings or trees. The M60 AMBT also has good gun handling up its sleeve, essentially being on par with top rank MBTs. The vehicle shares the same reload as most other Patton tanks armed with the 105 mm cannon: 8.7s reload stock, 7.7s reload maxed crew, 6.7s reload with an aced crew.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The M60 AMBT excels as a tank which is able to defend cap zones and destroy foes at far ranges. However, it lacks the protection of other MBTs. The main weaknesses of the M60 AMBT are the armour and pure size of it. All enemy tanks which it engages within combat are able to penetrate it with ease.

The cannon is the same cannon which you find on the [[M1A1_Abrams|M1A1]], [[M1A1 HC]], and [[M1A2 Abrams|M1A2]]. It offers great penetration, able to penetrate the toughest of foes. Its armour is that of an '''''[[M60A3_TTS|M60s]]'''''. It also shares the same platform as the '''''[[M60A3_TTS|M60s]]'''''. It's a tall, high profile tank, which can be seen with ease. However, an advantage of this is it's able to see over objects which most MBTs can't see over, due to their sleek low profile designs.

The M60 AMBT offers thermal sights, which allow it to spot the heat source of the enemy tanks, additionally it has a 25 mm LW25 grenade launcher which can cause major damage to critical parts of the enemy. Using its 25 mm HE grenades to knock out the enemy tank cannons and de-track them preventing them from escaping to safety. To get the best out of this tank, at long range, use the 120 mm cannon to snipe them to do this setup an ambush, watching their cap zones, engage thermal sights and await for the them to come. At close and medium ranges use the map and sneak up on the enemy foes, using the thermal sights to gain your advantage.

===Handling air threats===

To defeat these threats, scan the skies with the thermal sight and you will see the heat source of them. If they are approaching you or have fired a missile - pop smoke and withdraw, await for your SPAA to shoot them down, make sure to tag them on the map!
If the helicopter is close, shoot it with your main 120 mm cannon a single hit will see the tail drop of it. Now if the helicopter is right on top of you or within in machine gun range, use the 25 mm grenade launcher which will be able to bring it down with a few well placed bursts. Aim, for the flight deck and engine compartment. The M3P heavy machine gun also has a very fast fire rate which can deter enemy aircraft.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High penetrating APFSDS round, allowing effective engagement of any target from the front.
* Has much higher mobility than the other M60 series tanks, making it much more pleasant to play.
* Has a 25 mm autocannon on the turret roof, allowing easier engagement of low-flying helicopters.
* Is protected on the sides by composite screens and slat armour which can protect against HEAT projectiles and low-penetration autocannons, though it should not be relied upon.
* No ammunition is located in the turret bustle, which minimizes ammo detonation risk upon a turret hit.
* Has good 2nd generation gunner and commander Thermal optics (800x600)
* Quick gun handling

'''Cons:'''

* Has a stock HEATFS round with the APFSDS round as a Tier III modification; HEATFS can be useful but is generally less effective and versatile than APFSDS.
* Lacks useful armour such as composite or spaced armour: just about any shell that hits it is going to penetrate except for low-penetration autocannons from the front.
* Has a very large and weak mantlet which is able to be penetrated by high-penetration autocannons, such as those on the CV90 series; the turret ring is a target for even weak autocannons.
* Despite the much more powerful engine when compared to earlier M60s, the AMBT still does not have the mobility of the other MBTs at its BR.
* The commander's cupola is very large and the 25 mm gun is mounted high above the turret, and they will often give away your position, especially when trying to go hull down or when cresting a hill or ridge.
* Relatively tall silhouette, enemies have no problem identifying and spotting you.
* Reloads slower than other tanks armed with 120 mm guns

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

In 2011, the Turkish company StandartBio proposed a large-scale modernization program for outdated M60 tanks. The program was called the Affordable Main Battle Tank (AMBT) and was aimed to increase combat effectiveness of M60 tanks to a level roughly equivalent to modern main battle tanks. The main changes of this modernization were a new 1200 hp diesel engine, a modern fire control system with a ballistic computer and independent stabilization of the aiming line through a digital gunner's sight, as well as a new smooth-bore M256 120-mm gun. The tank's protection also increased slightly by installing solid hull side screens and tower slat screens. In addition, the tank received an electric turret drive, new surveillance optics, and a 25-mm automatic cannon in the commander's turret. The AMBT modernization program was designed entirely for foreign operators of the M60 from several countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
