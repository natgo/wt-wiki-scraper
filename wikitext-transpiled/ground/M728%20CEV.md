== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]] but was removed from the Gaijin store after the [[wt:en/news/8580-shop-war-thunders-birthday-sale-in-the-gaijinnet-store-en|War Thunder's 11th Anniversary sale]].

The M728 is a full-tracked combat engineer vehicle designed to provide maximum ballistic protection for the crew. It is a heavily armed derivative of the M60 series tank modified to provide a mobile and manoeuvrable weapon for combat support of ground troops and vehicles.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 2 and 3 are first stage ammo racks. They totals 23 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 3 - 1.
* Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready racks 2 and 3. If the ready racks are empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 into rack 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The M728 CEV has a very unique role in combat due to its high survivability and low-velocity gun. The M782 performs best in urban or mountainous locations as it has heavy armour in the right places to survive high intensity engagements and its gun can decimate almost every tank you will encounter at its BR with a well-placed shot. On maps with larger open areas, it is best to either stay back and try to play as artillery, although this will require a good feel for the shells' trajectory, or rush in as close as possible, tanking sniper shots on your armour as you close the distance to wreck havoc.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has a powerful 165 mm gun that fires shells with 20.31 kg TNT equivalent, one hit can always deal serious damage to the enemy vehicles
* Low muzzle velocity can allow the trajectory to hit some enemies hiding behind the slope, especially in AB
* The dozer blade in front it can provide additional utility, especially to protect the lower glacis

'''Cons:'''

* Terrible muzzle velocity makes this vehicle not very useful in spaced area, especially in RB
* Low reverse speed
* Top of the engine deck can be easily penetrated by planes
* HESH is inherently unreliable, a hit to a wrong spot on a certain enemy tank chassis or armour may do no damage at all despite the shell's potential, while a close miss might annihilate the enemy tank regardless
