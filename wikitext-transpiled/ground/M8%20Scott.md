== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened to '''{{specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 "Assault"]].

An infantry support variant of the [[M5A1]] light tank produced in World War II, the main difference in the {{PAGENAME}} is the open-top turret housing the 75 mm M2 howitzer. The 75 mm howitzer features large explosive shells, however it suffers from a relatively low muzzle velocity that hinders the long-range fighting performance of the {{PAGENAME}}.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

{{main|M2 Howitzer (75 mm)}}

Thanks to its HEAT shell, the M8 Scott's firepower can handle everything with ease, from destroying soft targets with overpressure like the LVT(A) to knocking out common foes like the [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Chi-Ha]] with a single shot to piercing tough adversaries like the [[B1 bis|B1]] and [[Matilda III|Matilda]]. The extremely slow turret traverse makes close quarter combat super challenging. Its short gun is also bad for long range engagements: it requires the player to be crystal clear of what they are doing, and have great situational awareness to predict the enemies' location in order to make up for the slow turret traverse and slow muzzle velocity.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)}}
The 12.7 mm M2HB is an excellent machine gun at this tier. It not only has the capability to threaten low-tier fighters and ground attack aircraft, but can even threaten armoured vehicles. Generally, the M2 should be saved for emergency situations against ground targets, as generally an HE or HEAT round is objectively more effective.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In general, the M8 Scott plays like a beefed-up M5A1. The massive increase in gun calibre and destructive potential gives it more flexibility when engaging heavier armoured targets. Like the M3/M5 Stuart, playing this tank aggressively will almost always guarantee a place on the leaderboard. Push for the cap and then take it without hesitation. Should an enemy get there first, enter the cap and flank the target. Get behind their turret and go for a shot to the turret rear. Once the capture point is held, find a good hull down position and use the 75 mm HEAT to destroy any and all oncoming tanks.

Against heavier armour, the need to find a good hidden position is critical. On certain tanks, the addition of track armour can give the M8 difficulty in penetrating them. Hence a good hull down position on their flank can provide a good position to hit their side armour, with almost certain destruction coming from it.

Tanks like the [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV F2]] and it's line of tanks can be a serious headache for the vehicle to encounter. Aim for the right side of their turret and knock-out their gunner first, then aim for the middle of their hull (upper or lower glacis works) for a final shot. Outside of that most of the heavy armour will be out of the M8's BR range, leaving most encountered vehicles viable to destroy.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* When hull-down its double layer turret front can bounce some low-calibre or low-penetrating shells like the [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]]s' 20 mm
* Speed and mobility akin to the [[M5A1]] light tanks, allowing it to manoeuvre and flank with ease
* Great firepower: thanks to its HEAT shell, the M8 can handle every vehicle it faces
* Extremely rare gun depression of -20 degrees making it able to peek above almost every slope and launch surprise attacks
* Short reload time for the calibre allows quick follow-up shots
* Low muzzle velocity shell's parabolic path can allow for shooting over hills which can be surprisingly useful
* 12.7 mm heavy machine gun is very lethal at the battle rating as most tanks have thin armour, for example the [[BT-7]], [[Marder III|Marder]]

'''Cons:'''

* Open-top turret exposes crew to overpressure and aircraft strafing fire
* Thin armour and tight crew makes it very vulnerable to tank destroyers that have APHE shells, like the SU-76
* Poor steering at high speeds
* Extremely slow turret traverse
* Shells have low muzzle velocity and huge drop, hard for shooting long-range or moving targets

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
===Development===
In United State's entry into World War II, the troops in the front lines require a support vehicle similar to those in use by the German forces in the form of the [[StuG III A|StuG III]]. The project for such vehicle began as a design submitted in late 1941, which was a [[M5A1|M5 Light Tank]] mated with a howitzer on the hull front, designated the ''T41''. This design didn't pass as the howitzer on the hull sacrificed crew protection. The design was revised on the same M5 light tank and instead had the M5 turret removed and replaced with an open-topped turret similar to the US tank destroyers [[M10 GMC|M10]] and [[M18 GMC|M18]], which mounted a 75 mm howitzer. This change caused the hatches for the driver and assistant driver to be placed on the glacis front rather than the hull roof. This design, called the ''T17E1 HMC'' was approved and put into production under the designation ''75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8'', or the [[M8 Scott]]. The 75 mm M2 howitzer was the initial armament of the M8 before switching to the updated 75 mm M3 howitzer later in production. The howitzer was capable of firing smoke M89 or high-explosive M48 rounds, the vehicle could hold 46 of these 75 mm rounds. The M8 does not have any machine guns on the coaxial or hull-mounted area, but a .50 cal Browning was mounted on the rear right corner of the turret for infantry defense. The vehicle was put into production in April 1942 and continued until January 1944, of which a total of 1,778 units were produced by Cadillac only.

===Combat usage===
These vehicles would go on to serve in the Italian Campaign, European Campaign, and in the Pacific in the hands of the US Army. The M8 saw use in American service until the M7 Priest 105 mm self-propelled gun could be fielded in large numbers, which stopped the M8 production and service in American units. After being phased out of American service, the M8 was then given to the Free French forces that use them in the Western Front of the European operations. The French continue to use them all the way to 1954 in the French-Indochina conflict in use by South-Vietnamese forces. Other users of the M8 included the Khmers national army, Laos, China, and the Philippines.
