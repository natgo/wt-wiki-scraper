== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.45 "Steel Generals"]], alongside the initial American ground tree, but wasn't available until Winter of the 2014 as an unlockable gift in the [[wt:en/news/2736-holiday-war-thunder-marathon-en|"War Thunder Christmas Special"]]. After that, the M8A1 became available again as a Warbond shop reward as part of [[wt:en/news/4312-shop-how-can-you-get-premium-vehicles-warbonds-en/|War Thunder's 4th anniversary]].

An upgunned [[M8 Scott]] armed with [[M3 (75 mm)|75 mm M3]] gun, the M8A1 is a light tank destroyer capable of flanking & destroying enemy tanks at the same time with its outstanding mobility.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This vehicle plays along with the American concept of the tank destroyers, fast and powerful, but lacking in armour. Using the terrain for cover is necessary to survive against the enemy shells, plus constant repositioning is needed to keep the enemy guessing where the M8A1 is located. However, if able to get the jump on the enemy, the 75 mm gun on this vehicle can destroy the vehicles at its rank and the addition of the .50 cal M2 Browning on top aids its versatility against lightly armoured vehicle and aircraft.

The main tactic for this vehicle is ''Shoot and Scoot'', constant repositioning after every shot as the armour on the M8A1 is rather thin for its battle rating. If hiding behind a rock, pop up from one side then the other rather than just from one side to force the enemy to spend milliseconds reacquiring the M8A1 in their sights, milliseconds that can put the favour of the battle to the M8A1. This involves many trick and will take some time to learn, but once learned, the M8A1 will be a huge assist to the team. Be careful to not get greedy and trigger-happy, the exposure trying to get a target may result in a loss, so play conservatively and know full well when that sometimes there will only be assist and move on. An M8A1 that is used properly is such a powerful tool that it can single handily swing the game. That being said one unlucky second and it is a pile of charred metal, due to the huge amount of ammo crammed into such a small area. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Deadly firepower at its BR, penetrating the toughest tanks with ease, such as the [[B1 bis|B1]], [[Matilda Mk II|Matilda]] or even the early [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1]] in an uptier. Other tanks like the [[T-80]] will easily get one-shot.
* Great gun depression allows hull-down shots on hills
* Multirole capacity (tank destroyer/light tank) allows flexible and fun gameplay
* Great mobility: reaches top speed relatively fast, and it doesn't lose speed drastically upon turning, allowing it to perform flanking manoeuvres easily.
* .50 cal machine gun can eliminate low flying aircraft & soft targets such as [[BT-7]], [[Marder III]], [[SU-76M]]. Also its low profile makes it easier to hide.
* No ammunition is stored inside the turret, decreasing the chance of ammo detonation which increases survivability
* Commonly misidentified as short-gunned M8 Scott

'''Cons:'''

* Thin armour plus the cramped crew gives it poor survivability. Can get destroyed easily by vehicles like [[ZiS-30]], [[SU-76M|SU-76]], [[StuG III A]]
* Gun breech is often damaged when turret is penetrated, making it defenceless
* Prone to drifting when cornering at high speeds
* Rather slow turret traverse speed (around 11 deg/s)
* Open-topped turret (exposing the crew & ammo rack) makes it vulnerable to artillery strikes and air attacks
* Although the gun is powerful, it still struggles to frontally penetrate the [[StuH 42 G]] especially with add-on tracks, while the StuH usually knocks out the M8 with a single shot
* All of its ammunition are stacked in every corner inside center compartment, single explosion in the middle of the hull can explode the ammo racks.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

===Development===
In United State's entry into World War II, the troops in the front lines require a support vehicle similar to those in use by the German forces in the form of the [[StuG III A|StuG III]]. The project for such vehicle began as a design submitted in late 1941, which was a [[M5A1|M5 Light Tank]] mated with a howitzer on the hull front, designated the ''T41''. This design didn't pass as the howitzer on the hull sacrificed crew protection. The design was revised on the same M5 light tank and instead had the M5 turret removed and replaced with an open-topped turret similar to the US tank destroyers [[M10 GMC]] and [[M18 GMC]], which mounted a 75 mm howitzer. This change caused the hatches for the driver and assistant driver to be placed on the glacis front rather than the hull roof. This design, called the ''T17E1 HMC'' was approved and put into production under the designation ''75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8'', or the [[M8 Scott]]. The 75 mm M2 howitzer was the initial armament of the M8 before switching to the updated 75 mm M3 howitzer on the [[M8A1|M8A1]] variant. The howitzer was capable of firing [[Smoke screen|smoke]] M89 or high-explosive M48 rounds, the vehicle could hold 46 of these 75 mm rounds. The M8 does not have any machine guns on the coaxial or hull-mounted area, but a .50 cal Browning was mounted on the rear right corner of the turret for infantry defense. The vehicle was put into production in April 1942 and continued until January 1944, of which a total of 1,778 units were produced by Cadillac only.

===Combat usage===
These vehicles would go on to serve in the Italian Campaign, European Campaign, and in the Pacific in the hands of the US Army. The M8 saw use in American service until the M7 Priest 105 mm self-propelled gun could be fielded in large numbers, which stopped the M8 production and service in American units. After being phased out of American service, the M8 was then given to the Free French forces that use them in the Western Front of the European operations. The French continue to use them all the way to 1954 in the French-Indochina conflict in use by South-Vietnamese forces. Other users of the M8 included the Khmers national army, Laos, China, and the Philippines.
