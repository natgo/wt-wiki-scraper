The '''{{Specs|name}}''', currently known as VT-1 in NORINCO catalogue, is an export MBT solution by NORINCO as the result of Sino-Pakistan Type 90-II program since 2001. After helping Pakistan to built their domestic tank maintenance and overhaul factory (now Heavy Industries Taxila), the menacing T-72S fleet in India became a major threat of Pakistan, thus they seek for the help from Mainland China which was developing new MBTs as well; the new MBT would have to follow the requirements from Pakistan while NORINCO design and manufacture the tank accordingly. Thanks to the improving relationships with western powers, NORINCO also acquired German engines and transmissions for their prototypes; the new BK1871 prototype was approved by Pakistan and was set as the foundation of the new MBT. The agreement was signed in 1990 and thus earning the name of Type 90 (-II was added to avoid confusion with JGSDF's Type 90); although there were plans to use NATO powerplants and transmission, after the political complications both at Mainland China and Pakistan, Type 90 would have to source the power pack from Ukraine (6TD from T-80UD which was also imported by Pakistan). The 3rd Type 90-II prototype was approved as the Type 90-IIM; with domestic FY-series ERA and AC unit for crew comfort installed, the new MBT, now under the name of MBT-2000 was finalized in 2000 and first shown in Abu Dhabi IDEX 2001 as the new export product of NORINCO. MBT-2000 is still listed on catalogue with revised designs and equipment for future battlefield.

Introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] and belongs to the NORINCO export vehicle family, MBT-2000 broke the curse of tanks using Warsaw-Pact powerplant and transmissions: not only it has the forward speed of a T-80UD, it also has an unpreceded reverse speed and neutral steering capabilities on most Eastern Bloc MBTs. The tank featured identical firepower to T-72 equivalents while having more advanced FCS and a chassis with design influence from western tanks; while the protection is relatively inferior to its Chinese cousins (namely ZTZ96A with FY-4 ERA), the great mobility and sufficient firepower can lead the tank to victory.

<small>''Note: HIT and NORINCO are both eligible for the production of MBT-2000, where those Pakistan-exclusive tanks are known as Al-Khalid and those produced by NORINCO as VT-1.''</small>

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The overall design philosophy of MBT-2000 departed from the conventional Eastern-Bloc/Chinese design in terms of the chassis - instead of having a well-sloped hull at around 68°, it has a design similar to Leopard 2 which has extended UFP for better protection. But in this case, MBT-2000 also retained a relatively low profile like Eastern-Bloc tanks while having a welded turret. Aside from the the standard protections on tank, this was in fact the first production Chinese tank with ERA installed on the hull and turret (FY-2) with both KE and CE protection against respective threats; although the extended UFP might be more familiar to NATO players, MBT-2000 doesn't have the best capability defending itself at higher tiers due to the low KE protection from the FY-2 ERA, this intensifies as the LFP is also relatively large and makes it vulnerable to oncoming shots. Another note is that the problem of casted gun mantle still haunts MBT-2000 and future Chinese tanks, any penetrated shots would very likely disable the gun system to certain extent, sometimes even detonation of ammunition stored behind the crew.

The internal layout is more or less the continuation of Chinese design philosophy, the crew of 3 with a driver on the centerline of tank and side fuel tanks next to the driver, as well as the AZ-172 inspired autoloader makes MBT-2000 feel like a oversized ZTZ96 to some extent; in most cases, due to the internal layout and aforementioned protection, penetrated shots will very likely take out the driver right away; while fuel explosions, crew knock-down and the worst case possible - complete kill due to ammunition detonation are always types of death sentences to the tank.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The most uncommon feature of MBT-2000 is the powerpack. There are stereotype that Eastern Bloc-made transmissions could only go forward but not in reverse (due to the need to rescue friendly tanks or itself), but thanks to the addition of a side-transmission designed by Ukrainian designers, the Kharkov 6TD-2 powerpack not only can push the tank at up to 69 km/h, it can also go reverse at -31 km/h and neutral steering like NATO tanks, vastly improving its flexibility on battlefield.

{{main|ZPT98 (125 mm)}}

As MBT-2000 was finalized by late-1990s and for the need for better firepower, it uses Chinese equivalent of 125 mm smoothbore cannon with an AZ-172 style autoloader; the overall handling of the gun would be identical to post-ZTZ96/99 MBTs before domestic electric drive gun layer could enter service, while the horizontal traverse is sufficient, be extra careful when crossing terrains as the vertical traverse is rather slow.

==== Ammunition ====
{{:ZPT98 (125 mm)/Ammunition|DTP-125, DTB-125, 125-I, DTB12-125}}'''DTP-125, HEAT-FS, Stock''' - DTP-125 has been a long-time friend to Chinese 125 mm gun and one of the stock shells for the MBT-2000; like many HEATFS of its tier, due to ERA and composite armor are commonplace at its tier, hitting enemies from the front would very like be fruitless. So if opting for HEATFS to take out enemies, make sure to aim for non-ERA/composite covered parts or by flanking enemies if possible; remembering where their ammunition located can earn players a quick kill against enemies. It is still a versatile shell to have against all types of ground target.

'''DTB-125, HE-FS, Stock''' - DTB-125 is also available as the other stock shell; like suggested by Chinese thesis, HEFS could in fact serve as a makeshift anti-tank shell to hit enemy optics or top plates with low protection and possibly trigger overpressure, dooming the crew and internal compartments of enemy vehicles. This also enables the tank to do "top-down" attacks against tanks behind cover, notably NATO tanks with higher profile and CITV. Thanks to the high explosive content, it is also a better option to knock-out light vehicles right away than the HEATFS.

'''125-I, APFSDS, Tier III''' - 125-I (aka 一期弹; Stage 1 ammunition) is the only kinetic shell for the tank and would be the ammo of choice for MBT-2000 once researched. The higher mass and velocity of 125-I makes it quite easy to hit long-range target while retaining sufficient penetration to do extensive damage to internal compartments, this might not have the highest penetration at higher tiers, but well-placed shots on where the enemy crew is sitting or going for the ammunition is always a good way to send enemy tanks to their kingdom come.

'''DTB12-125, HE-FS (VT), Tier IV''' - Unlike Soviet/Russian HE-FS with timed fuse, DTB12 is currently the only HE-VT for its caliber; not only it can still be used as "anti-tank" shells like its stock counterpart albeit at lesser explosive content, enemy aircrafts will have to face a 125 mm makeshift AA gun with 7 m triggering radius - it is never a good idea getting hit by such a huge shell.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Excellent mobility 
** 6TD-2 powerpack with high engine output
** Additional side-transmissions enables "neutral steering" albeit being single-flow transmission
** -31 km/h reverse speed to get away from danger
* Devastating firepower with varieties of ammunition
* Optics with variable magnification for different engagement ranges
* TVD sights for faster target acquisition
* Commander override and CITV for last-ditch retaliation
* Thick turret protection

*

'''Cons:'''

* Inconsistent protection
** The cast gun mantle still haunts the turret protection
** Overall lesser hull protection than ZTZ96A due to ERA selection and large LFP
* Slow gun vertical traverse
* Rear arc of fire is restricted by the elevated engine deck
* Inferior TVD than Chinese domestic MBTs with only Gen 1 TVD available
* Rather cramped compartment and crew layout
* Infamous autoloader with relatively slow fixed reload rate and high chance of detonation once hit
