== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/4976-shop-the-new-e-r-a-bundles-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]]. It was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6263-shop-war-thunder-summer-sale-en|2019 Summer sales]], was then made available briefly for purchase with Golden Eagles {{ge}} during the [[wt:en/news/6412-special-german-unity-day-en|2019 "German Unity Day"]] event, and was finally reintroduced as a premium vehicle purchasable in-game for Golden Eagles {{ge}} during the [[wt:en/news/6442-special-war-thunder-reaches-its-7th-year-en|7th Anniversary sale]].

''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.''

'''Notes''':

* As they are modeled by sets of 2, shells disappear from the rack only after you fire both shells in the set.
* Racks 3, 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 11 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 2.
* When refilling from racks 1 and 2, the refill order of ready racks is 5 - 4 - 3.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} tank is great for rushing the capture points in Realistic battles. Once there, fall back a little and find a good place for surveying the battlefield while looking for targets to snipe using your great HEAT rounds.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very good turret - most of shots will either bounce or non-pen it
* The hull can't be penetrated by most of the tanks it faces; only a few tanks with high calibre cannons can penetrate it
* Very good speed and turning ability
* Very good acceleration
* Decent reverse speed (-19 Km/h)
* Very fast turret rotation
* Very potent gun with access to a variety of shells to use in any situation
* Gun depression of -10° is usually sufficient
* Roof-mounted and coaxial 12.7 mm machine guns, useful against airplanes and lightly armoured vehicles
* Have access to smoke grenades

'''Cons:'''

* The hull machine gun port and the armour plates around it are weak spots
* LFP can't stop a lot of rounds at its BR

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
===Development===
The '''M47 Patton''' came about only a few years after its predecessor, the [[M46|M46 Patton]]. The basis of this design was the [[M26|M26 Pershing]], which was deemed insufficiently mobile for its role as a medium tank. The M46 was mainly the M26 Pershing with a new engine, transmission, and a redesigned 90 mm gun. While a good solution for the lacking M26 Pershing design, it was only considered a stopgap solution while the experimental T42 medium tank was being developed. However, the Korean War put a stop in that development due to an urgent need of tanks, so the T42 project, which would produce a completely new tank design, was put on hold.

An interim decision was made to mount the turret from the T42 onto the hull of the M46 Patton, this modified tank was designated the '''M47 Patton''' and entered production in 1951. A common nickname for the tank was the Patton II, due to the same name as the M46 Patton, this was changed to Patton 47 a few weeks later. The M47 Patton featured most of the armament seen from the M26 Pershing and M46 Patton, with a 90 mm gun and a coaxial and hull-mounted .30 cal machine gun, and a .50 cal machine gun on top of the turret. The M47 Patton has the distinction of being the last American tank with the hull-mounted machine gun on the bow. The new turret required the hull to be redesigned with a larger turret ring and had a "needle-nose" design with the turret mantlet heavily sloped towards the cannon, the design's heavy sloping nature also helped improve protection. The turret also had a large protrusion at the back to act as storage. An M12 stereoscopic range finder was also mounted on a turret, which was difficult to use, but would appear in every American tank design from here on until the M1 Abrams design.

Though technically a medium tank by the army standards, a new standardization in US Army tank designation on November 9, 1950, had the entire system changed from the weight of the tank to the calibre of the vehicle's gun. Therefore in the 1950s, the "Medium Tank M47 Patton" name was changed to '''90 mm Gun Tank M47 Patton'''. This designation would go on for future American tank designs. The M47 Patton began production in June 1951 before its standardization at the Detroit Tank Arsenal. Delays in the production schedule caused a long period of testing to occur until it was standardized in May 1952. Production ran until November 1953 with a total production number of more than 9,000 M47 Pattons between Detroit and Alco.

===German usage===
The rebuilding Bundeswehr of West Germany became one of the largest receivers of American M47 tanks, receiving up to 1,120 M47 tanks in the 1950s alongside [[M48A2_C|M48s]].<ref name="ZalogaM47&48 pg(1)">Zaloga 1999, p.13</ref> However, it was widely recognized in both America and Germany that the M47s quality was of an interim design, and so its replacement by more modern designs was sought out.<ref name="JerchelLeopardI Loc(1)">Jerchel 1995, Loc 17 of 813</ref> This was done by phasing them out with the deliveries of more M48 tanks,<ref name="ZalogaM47&48 pg(1)" /> as well as the production of the new [[Leopard I]] tanks in 1965.<ref name="JerchelLeopardI Loc(2)">Jerchel 1995, Loc 105 of 813</ref>

The phased out German M47 tanks was most notably given out to Turkey, making up a portion of the total 1,347 M47 tanks it received from both Germany and America. These M47s in Turkish service would be involved in the 1974 invasion of Cyprus in Operation Attila.<ref name="ZalogaM47&48 pg(2)">Zaloga 1999, p.38</ref>
