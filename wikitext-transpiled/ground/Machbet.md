== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

An upgrade of the [[Hovet]], the Machbet features 4 all-aspect infrared-tracking Stinger missiles that allow it to engage long-range targets and an IRST tracker that is more reliable than the [[AN/VPS-2]] which also doesn't trigger aircraft RWRs.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Despite its thin armour, the Machbet has the particularity of being able to withstand some misplaced shots, but pay attention to HE shells that are able to destroy instantly the vehicle .

Beware also of tanks equipped with machine guns above 7.62 mm calibre, these tanks can easily penetrate the sides of the vehicle.

'''Armour type:'''
* Aluminium Alloy 5083

=== Mobility ===

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
While not being the fastest vehicle, especially while stock, the Machbet lack power in slope but on flat ground , he can handle himself pretty easily.

{{main|M168 (20 mm)}}

The Machbet is equipped like the M163 with a 20 mm M168 VADS, or Vulcan air defence system. The M168 is a variant of the M61 cannon, which can be found in-game on vehicles such as the Japanese T-2, and the American F-4C Phantom II. Used initially during the Vietnam war, the M168 was a 20 mm air-cooled rotary cannon attached to a small turret on the Machbet. Dangerous to anything in the sky below 2 km, it will lock on and rip through anything in its path. Helicopter and plane will be crippled effectively.

{{main|FIM-92 Stinger}}

The FIM-92 E and K are effective weapons but only under certain conditions. With turns at 10 G maximum, the missile will not be able to follow some aircraft unless the angle is favourable. Opportune moments to hit an aircraft are when it is facing directly towards the missile launcher or flying directly away from it. The K upgrade of the missile is more likely to hit due to its proximity fuse with a trigger radius of 5 m. Helicopters, on the other hand, have a good chance of being hit due to their low altitude. Without the use of countermeasures, the missile can be sure to hit a helicopter. However, missiles may have a hard time acquiring helicopters if they are low to the ground, and helicopters may use the terrain to mask themselves or evade incoming missiles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Machbet is a very good anti-aircraft vehicle if its capabilities and limitations are managed. It excels in many areas behind the front lines, either directly supporting allies during an assault or back towards spawn or capture points to maintain security.

Difficulties will be met around BR 10.0 matches as multiple aircraft types will have access to countermeasures able to defeat the FIM-92 Stinger missiles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to capable FIM-92 Stinger missiles even when stock.
** FIM-92K missile an upgradeable option to enhance lethality due to proximity fuze.
* Have powerful 20 mm M168 for close-range protection against aircraft.
* Lightweight with good horsepower for good mobility
* Access to thermal imager
* Access to a laser rangefinder

'''Cons:'''

* Armour is thin and basically non-existent except against machine gun calibre rounds
* 20 mm only useful within 2 km firing distance

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== [[wt:en/news/7601-development-machbet-desert-vulcan-en|Devblog]] ===
After the M163 VADS began being decommissioned from American service, the vehicle was heavily exported to foreign operators. Israel was one of several states which adopted the M163 VADS into its own military under the name 'Hovet' in the early 1980s. By the early 1990s however, it was realized that the system required modernization. As such, the IAI company was tasked with developing an upgrade package.

Together with General Dynamics, IAI upgraded the Hovet's fire control system and equipped the vehicle with a Stinger missile launcher, in an effort to increase the vehicle's effectiveness against low-flying jet aircraft. Following successful testing of the prototype in 1997, the vehicle was formally accepted into service with the IDF under the name 'Machbet' in 1998. In the upcoming years, several of the older Hovets were modernized to the Machbet standard. However, the Machbet only saw a short service life with the IDF. Because of changing tasks and requirements, the Machbet was officially withdrawn from active service in 2006.
