== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]]. It is identical in armour, armament, and mobility to the German [[M48A2 C]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour of the Magach 2 is identical to the [[M48A1]] and [[M48A2 C]]. The ammo rack in the turret is removed and the shape of the front hull ammo racks are improved. The front armour is able to handle almost most of the APHE shells it might face, but struggles against HEATFS and APDS rounds. The lower front plate is a big weak spot. The sides are decently armoured, but not thick enough to make angling the hull a valid tactic. Some thin vents on the top of the hull are vulnerable to strafing and bombing runs by enemy aircraft, which may cause engine fires. Overall, the Magach 2 has excellent armour protection for its tier.

'''Armour type:'''
* Cast homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull rear, hull rear roof)

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled by sets of 2 and disappear from the rack after you've fired both shells in the set.
* Racks 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 27 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
** These racks are also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3.
** Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready racks 4 and 5. If both ready racks are empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 3 into rack 5 then 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
* If you pack 21&nbsp;''(+43)'' shells, it will keep the front hull and the turret bustle empty of ammo.

== Usage in battles ==	
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Magach 2 is best used in an urban environment when stock due to having only APCR and HE shells and no rangefinder modification. The Magach 2 is good when playing support with teammates or at ambushing. Once you have all engine upgrades installed, you are able to move quite fast so you can keep up with most other tanks at this BR. The most noteworthy enemies are the T-54/55s.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Rangefinder modification greatly increases the speed to rangefind a target 
* The HESH round can be used to overpressure tanks on weak spots like the roof
* The HEAT round can penetrate just about anything at its BR 
* Commander override can save you if your gunner gets knocked out 
* Turret armour can save you sometimes if someone misses and hits too far left, right, or high

'''Cons:'''

* The weak hull armour can't reliably bounce shots or stop them
* Stock APCR round does perform well against sloped armour and will most of the time bounce off the target 
* Ammo is in the left side of the turret and will most of the time get detonated if a shot penetrates the turret
