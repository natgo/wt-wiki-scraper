== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled by sets of 2 and disappear from the rack after you've fired both shells in the set.
* Racks 4 and 5 are first stage ammo racks. They total 27 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
** These racks are also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3.
** Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready racks 4 and 5. If both ready racks are empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 3 into rack 5 then 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
* If you pack 21&nbsp;''(+43)'' shells, it will keep the front hull and the turret bustle empty of ammo.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
