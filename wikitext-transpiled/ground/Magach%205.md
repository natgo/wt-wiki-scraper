== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Magach 5 was, at its core, an upgraded American M48A5. The Magach 5 was introduced in Israel after the Yom Kippur War of 1973. After this war, the IDF had to replace several examples of their Magach and Sho't tanks that were lost, especially due to anti-tank weapons like the RPG-2, RPG-7, and Malyutka ATGMs. To address this issue, the IDF adopted the American M48A5 and designated it Magach 5. This version of the tank was also an upgrade of the M48A3, incorporating the 105 mm rifled gun over the 90 mm gun in earlier M48 models. This upgrade was based in part in Israeli experiences with Magach tanks in 1967 and 1973.

It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]]. The Magach 5 plays like most M48 tanks. However, compared to previous models, the Magach 5 incorporates a more capable 105 mm gun with increased firepower. The upgrade however does not include a stabilizer, which can often be seen at its BR. However, the tank is very much protected against all sorts of HEAT and HE projectiles, as well as early ATGMs like the MILAN that lack tandem warheads. This is because the Magach 5 incorporates Blazer ERA, this is a very early ERA, even weaker than Kontakt-1, so it is not enough to stop APDS and APFSDS projectiles, or even high calibre HEAT projectiles from 120 and 125 mm guns.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Magach 5 is a fairly manoeuvrable MBT but its larger profile makes it easy to spot. The 105 mm Sharir cannon does well at long range shooting, as many tanks in the same BR can be destroyed with a single hit. The Magach 5 fares well in an urban setting with a fairly quick turret traverse and powerful ammo, however it is not the fastest and should have teammates nearby to cover the flanks. The front ammo stowage is the biggest detriment to the tanks survival in a frontal hit, so the ammo count should kept as low as possible. Overall, this tank is just right for most environments with it being most vulnerable to comparable ammo from other Western nations.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good firepower
* Decent mobility
* Surprisingly survivable, two crew members often survive a shot
* ERA able to defeat low-end chemical shells

'''Cons:'''

* Ineffective armour in an uptier
* No stabilizer
* Ammunition explosions are common as most of the shells are in the front next to the driver
* ERA only effective against chemical shells - only provides 5 mm kinetic protection

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.

The Magach 5 was introduced after the Yom Kippur War of 1973. During this war, the IDF suffered heavy losses to Egyptian and Syrian anti tank weapons like the RPG-2, RPG-7 and Malyutka ATGMs. The Magach 5 was a way to address this lack of tanks in the IDF with more modern units, specifically the M48A5. This variant was at its core an upgraded M48A3 and incorporated several lessons from the Israeli experience with Magach tanks in 1967 and 1973.

The Magach 5 incorporated a 105 mm rifled gun, since during the Vietnam War it was evident that the 90 mm gun was not enough to destroy modern Soviet armour or even support infantry. 105 mm projectiles had more power to penetrate the armour in modern tanks and their HE warhead was more suited for direct support tasks. The Magach 5 also incorporated a low profile cupola based in the Israeli Urdan design.

However, the Magach 5 had several differences compared to the American M48A5, for instance, it included the RISE upgrade installed in the M60A1, the most evident upgrade was the installation of the BLAZER ERA kit that was meant to protect against portable anti-tank weapons like the RPG, that caused heavy casualties to IDF tank units in the Yom Kippur War. The biggest improvement could be considered the installation of a gun stabilizer in some units, since originally the M48A5 didn't include any sort of stabilizer.

Israel purchased 150 of these vehicles in 1978 and fitted with Blazer ERA alongside the Centurion-based Sho't Kal tanks. The Magach 5 participated in Operation Peace for Galilee and the new upgrades proved sufficient to deal with older Soviet ATGMs and RPGs. The Magach 5 served with Israel for several years, starting from the mid 1980s the tank was given to reserve units and was gradually retired from active service.
