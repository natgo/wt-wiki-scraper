== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour (hull, turret, roof)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull roof - engine compartment, hull rear - engine grille)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Magach 6A is basically an M60A1 without the stabilizer, an advantage you lose against your enemies. Firing on the move will be difficult and your reaction time will be hindered, depending on the situation.

Similar to the [[Magach 6]], play on the flanks, and/or away from the frontline. Without the stabilizer, it will be significantly harder to shoot on the move. With the new turret, you will be able to bounce more shells than usual, even APDS shots. However, don't rely on your armour heavily, especially if the enemies knows where your weak spots are located. Always expect to be penetrated by an enemy, unless you know you can shrug off a shot or two from them. With the 105 mm M68 cannon comes a new stock shell, the M728 APDS. It's slightly worse on flat penetration than the M392A2 but offers more penetration at an angle, and of course there is the HEATFS round to help overall, while having its own disadvantages.

In closed quarters combat and urban environments, stick to nearby teammates if you are going to the frontline or an objective. Lacking a stabilizer will hinder your reaction time. Noticeable enemies to note are vehicles such as the T-55A/AM-1, all British MBTs such as the Centurion Mk 10, and Leopard A1A1. Try to go around where a battle is taking place to catch the enemy off guard. Your armour will be slightly better than the Magach 6, but don't heavily rely on it, especially in closed quarters combat where shells will be more effective than at range.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to 2 x .50 cal HMGs, perfect for shredding air targets and lightly-armoured targets
** The M2HB will always be a backup if your commander is knocked out
* Very strong turret protection
* The commander can take control of the gun if the gunner is knocked out
* Great mobility and handling characteristics
* Great gun performance with APDS and HEATFS shells

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks a stabilizer
* Big profile
* Commander cupola is a big weak spot for vehicles equipped with APHE shells
* Turret ring is a weak spot.
* Vulnerable to HEATFS and ATGM launchers
* Huge turret ammo rack when fully loaded.
