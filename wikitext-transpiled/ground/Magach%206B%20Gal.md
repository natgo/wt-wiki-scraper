== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Magach 6B Gal was an important upgrade developed by Israel before the 1990s. Since it was obvious that the Merkava would not entirely replace the Magach in service it was deemed necessary an upgrade to older models like the Magach 6B and A that lacked any sort of modern military electronics and optics. As such, the "Gal" Fire Control System was created and then fitted into the Magach 6B and 6A models. It was not given to the C model since this used a more modern American fire control system. The Magach 6B Gal would later be upgraded to the Magach 6B Gal Batash with improvements to the protection and powerplant.

It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]]. The Magach 6B Gal has a decent performance for it's BR, compared to very common tanks like the T-72M1 and Leopard 1A1, it lacks the mobility and protection of both vehicles, but it compensates this with a decent protection against HEAT projectiles and missiles, as well as autocannon ammunition. This is very important at it's BR and is thanks to the Blazer ERA, it would be enough to stop small rockets and missiles, which are very common at that BR with early ATGMs launched from rockets and different IFVs. The mobility, while poor, is not enough to make the vehicle slow, and the Magach 6B Gal has decent acceleration and top speed, it mostly lacks reverse speed like Soviet Tanks around it's BR.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Magach 6B has the same amount of protection as the M60A1, that is, a weak hull with a turret capable of deflecting some shots coming from steep angles. However it has the added benefit of the Blazer ERA, it would be enough to stop older early ATGMs fired from IFVs and Helicopters, as well as HE and small HEAT rounds. It can also help against rockets and autocannon shots. But it would not be enough to stop any sort of APDS or APFSDS projectiles.

The Magach 6B Gal was part of the Magach 6 family, that is, modified American M60 tanks suited to Israeli needs. This modernization was made to the Magach 6B model and incorporated several changes to the electronics and systems inside the tank, as well as the armour.

Since the Merkava tanks were still not available in enough numbers to completely replace the Magach, it was decided to introduce upgrades to the Magach 6B in order to improve survivability and lethality. The most important weaknesses of the Magach 6 were the firepower and optics of the tank and the protection of the tank.

The first upgrade was the installation of the "Gal" Fire Control System that was installed in all Magach 6B tanks, this was a huge improvement over the old M13 and M17 optical rangefinders, since the upgrade introduced laser rangefinders and thermal imaging system for the gunner. This thermal imaging system was the same used in the first models of the Merkava. By the 1990s the Magach 6B Gal was the best Magach in service with Israeli forces, in fact, it's fire control system was offered in the international markets under the name "Matador".

The Gal later received even more upgrades, since it was clear that Blazer ERA was not enough to deal with modern threats in the battlefield, of course, it was not going to be enough to stop modern anti tank projectiles fired from enemy tanks. But it was intended to be enough to stop older missiles and RPGs that were commonly used by Hezbollah militias and other paramilitary groups. This upgrade of the ERA was incorporated in some models of the Magach 6B Gal, however it was mostly used in the Gal Batash model.
