== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

The very last variant of Israel Magach series with redesigned applique armour, although not being the most protected tank of its era, Magach 7C still gives players the chance to fight back with its improved FCS, powerplant, new APFSDS and slightly better protection than its predecessors.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
From Magach 6 (M60A1/3)  to the 7 series, aside from still based on M60s, the redesigns on the 7 series adopted a more Merkava-like approach with applique armours on different spots of the tank; in 7C's case, the hull is now protected by an extra layer of composite applique armour on the front and the first 2 side skirts, while the turret received an complete redesign from being covered by ERA blocks and NERA applique blocks to an arrow-shaped turret with extra layer of composite applique armour. While this is nowhere sufficient for APFSDS of its era, tanks with HEAT; APDS or even APCBC will have a hard time penetrating its  armour, giving it extra survivability to its predecessors. The interior layout though is mostly identical to its predecessors, but the tank is more cramped with shells even with 6 shells less than predecessors- any penetrated shots will very likely detonate the ammunition located on the center mass of the tank.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

{{main|Sharir (105 mm)}}

After the introduction of the M68 gun by the US Army, Israel got the license for producing the gun locally as the "Sharir" tank cannon and later tanks were upgraded with this gun. The Magach 7C is no exception. While the gun traverse speed is slightly better, the overall performance is identical to 105 mm cannons for M60 series, although not being the best tank gun of its tier, the variety of shells can make sure Magach 7C would still have the chance to take on more modern tanks.

==== Ammunition ====
The Magach 7C shares the same ammunition as its tech-tree predecessor Magach 6B [[Gal Batash]], although the 105 mm gun is deemed insufficient to more advanced MBTs like T-64 and T-72. However, utilizing the latest ammunition for the 105 mm gun would still give Magach 7C the chance to defeat them.

'''M152; HEAT-FS''' - The stock shell; while the shell is more than enough to defeat earlier tanks or those without ERA, any advanced MBTs it might face can stop the shell with ease with its composite armour. To make sure the best utilization of the shell, pick the targets wisely: go for light targets or NATO tanks with relatively less protection. Flanking is only viable if the tank could reach vantage points at the first place.

'''M156; HESH''' - One of the first researchable rounds for the tank; while the explosive content is more than enough to take out light vehicles or MBTs showing their sides right away, the ballistic performance hinders its long-range capability. Having the laser rangefinder equipped does help the M156 to reach targets which are in hull-down position at longer ranges. A precise hit on a weak spot can easily overpressurize enemies or cause extensive shrapnel damage to internal compartments.

'''M111; APFSDS''' - The other tier 1 ammunition researchable, it might not have the best penetration of its tier, but being a long-rod APFSDS means the it will have better odds to penetrate well-protected MBTs frontally. While Warsaw-Pact and Chinese tanks could be harder to take out, a precise hit on their LFP is very likely to detonate either their fuel tanks or ammunition racks.

'''M426; APFSDS''' - The final round and the go-to round for the tank; the Israeli equivalent to 105 mm DM63, it is among the best 105 mm APFSDS available and having vastly improved penetration to M111. This also means it can now penetrates earlier Warsaw-Pact MBTs safely even at longer ranges, but MBTs such as T-64BV and ZTZ96A can still cause major problem for Magach 7C.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* High acceleration thanks to the new engine pack
* Access to variety of ammunition (M426 APFSDS and M156 HESH)

* Sufficient amount of smoke grenades

'''Cons:'''

* Slow for its BR
* Rather cramped interior filled with ammunition
* Rather slow gun traverse speed to competitors
* Huge in size, can be easily identified by enemies
* Fixed 8x gunsight that hinders its gun flexibility
