== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

The {{PAGENAME}} is an improvement over the [[Marder A1-]] with additional armour plates added all around the hull that should make the vehicle better withstand autocannon rounds from a distance, though close-range protection is still paper thin. The additional armour implemented on {{PAGENAME}} does make the vehicle slightly heavier than the Marder A1-, and while this should make impact mobility slightly, the differences in in-game performance is negligible. Armament between the two variants are similar too, with the {{PAGENAME}} retaining the MILAN ATGM and the 20 mm Rh202 autocannon. Armament differences lay in the APDS availability for the 20 mm autocannon and the removal of the rear-mounted MG3A1.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

The Marder 1A3's armour is minimal, even if a bit better than its predecessor's. Any calibre larger than light machine guns (7.62 mm) can penetrate the vehicle. Therefore you must be careful and not expose the vehicle. 

'''Armour type:'''

* High hardness rolled armour (hull front and roof)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull sides and rear, gun mount, cupola)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels, tracks and torsion bars are 20 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

The mobility is very good with a top speed of 84 km/h both forwards and backwards. This makes you faster than most other tanks at this battle rating.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good mobility
* Respectable ATGM for defeating most tanks
* Equipped with thermal sights and laser rangefinder
* 20 mm autocannon is effective against aircraft
* Removal of the machine gun from the [[Marder A1-]] provides better view of the back
* Addition of the DM63 APDS belts increases the effectiveness of the 20 mm

'''Cons:'''

* Mediocre survivability
* Poor gun depression of the ATGM Launcher limits close-range effectiveness when firing from behind hills
* The 20 mm gun penetration performance makes it unlikely to common ground units faced except the thinnest armoured ones
* Large profile
* Only carries 4 ATGMs

== History ==
