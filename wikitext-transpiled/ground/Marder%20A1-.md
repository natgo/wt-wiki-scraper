== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Red Skies"]].

Being the first true German IFV in the tech tree, the Marder A1- offers some unique options to its operator with regards to dispatching its opponents, no matter if they come on the ground or in the air.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Overall, armour on Marder A1- is to be expected from an IFV; thin armour that relies heavily on slopes for protection. However, the turret is unmanned and coupled with a great gun depression of -17°, allowing for a hull-down really well.

From the frontal arc, the armour can shrug off most heavy machine guns and autocannons up to 23 mm calibre, like those found on [[ZSU-23-4|Shilkas]]. Be wary though as lucky shots can get through the turret ring or shatter on the driver's optics, sending shrapnel inside the fighting compartment.

From sides and rear, even .50 cal will do some serious damage to the vehicle and crew, so keeping the front of the armour towards the enemy is the key for survival from MG fire.

With only three crew members available, the Marder can't afford to take any hits. When looking at Marder from the front, the driver on the right side is protected only by an 11 mm thin armour plate angled at 73°, so expect the driver to die first a lot to enemy fire. Meanwhile, both commander and gunner sit side by side below the unmanned turret, protected by transmission and engine (similar to [[Merkava (Family)|Merkava tanks]]). While that won't protect them from rounds with explosive filler or modern kinetic penetrators, it can negate shrapnel from older chemical and HESH rounds. Commanders and gunner survivability are thus significantly higher than that of a driver, allowing to fire back at the opponent in most cases.

The last thing to note about the armour is that the roof armour is only 11 mm, making the Marder heavily vulnerable to air attacks if the gun isn't trained on the attacker.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The mobility of Marder is really, really good, allowing it to rush favourable positions at the start of the battle or flank effectively. With a reverse gearbox, it can move backwards as fast as going forward, making disengaging from an enemy or retreating from unfavourable situations an easy task.

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=930|rbMinHp=531}}

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Since the Marder A1- is already powerful in the firepower department thanks to its MILAN ATGMs, even in its stock configuration, it should have no problems dispatching your enemies. After Parts and FPE, one can either start upgrading its mobility or go for a fuller APIT belt to have better chances when fighting light vehicles.

Since it can't engage enemies at longer ranges with the autocannon and MILANs are SACLOS-guided, getting a laser rangefinder is not a priority when playing solo. Instead, going for optics upgrades and smoke grenades might be preferable. Night vision devices could be also considered, but night battles on this BR are uncommon.

== Armaments ==

=== Main armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|Rh202 (20 mm)}}

The Marder A1- is armed with a dual-feed Rh202 20 mm autocannon. This gun can also be found as a secondary weapon on the [[KPz-70]] and [[Leopard 2K]]; the difference being it gets dedicated belts on Marder instead of being limited only to multipurpose stock belts.

Rh202 has fantastic gun handling. Even though it is not equipped with a stabiliser, it's barely noticeable even when firing on the move, allowing to successfully engage enemies without stopping at close range.

With a great rate of fire (noticeably faster than 30 mm found on [[BMP-2]]s), it can shred light vehicles, low flying planes and helicopters to pieces in a matter of seconds. Even heavier tanks are not safe since it is able to disable their critical components with a well-aimed burst, crippling their main and secondary armaments and tracks, making them easy kills for its MILANs or more-heavily armed teammates.

With 65° degrees of gun elevation, it can even work ad hoc as makeshift SPAAG. This is especially useful against helicopter rushes, which are common at the start of the round when chances of friendly SPAA being active are low. Even planes are not safe when the Marder is around, since it is able to successfully engage low flying aircraft with enough practice.

Rh202 operates on 200 round belts, Marder can take 6 of them in total and you can switch between different belts with ~1-second delay. An empty belt is reloaded after 8 seconds when Aced.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}} - The stock belt consists of HVAP-T and HEFI-T rounds in a ratio of 1:1. It works but can have problems penetrating lighter vehicles due to the occasional chance that it won't hit a critical component with an HVAP-T round.
* '''DM51A1:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}} - Stock belt that consists of HEFI-T and HVAP-T rounds in a ratio of 3:1, this belt would be of great use against infantry but have no use in vehicular combat. Although the round can be effective, while taking down helicopters, or low flying planes. 
* '''DM43:''' {{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}} - Tier I modification, this belt consists of HVAP-T and HEFI-T rounds in a ratio of 3:1. This belt should be the primary type of ammo for Rh202, since it has the best available penetration.

* Racks disappear after you've fired all belts in the rack.
* Due to the Marder's belt feed design, the third ammo rack is connected directly to the gun. For the third ammo rack to be emptied, the tank must run out of ammunition.

{{main|MILAN}}

The Marder A1- is armed with a MILAN ATGM launcher with SACLOS guidance. It's an older missile, lacking a tandem warhead, but since composite and reactive armour are a rare sight at the battle rating, it works wonders. The ATGM is the main weapon of choice when engaging targets beyond 200 m and when engaging anything heavier than a light tank or SPAAG. The Marder only gets 4 of those, so firing them recklessly can leave it unable to dispatch heavier opponents. Frequent visits to capture points are a must in order to keep fighting.

To fire them, the Marder A1- needs to be going slower than 5 km/h, which can be disadvantageous against enemy tanks with stabilisers - be sure to distract the enemy first with the autocannon fire or make sure the enemy doesn't know at all from where the Marder will be striking.

Also, be aware that the launcher can't depress as much as the autocannon: this is important to note when fighting in hilly terrain. While it is possible to fire and hit an enemy, the missile needs a few seconds and distance to correct itself, making close-range shots impossible without considerable skill and practise (for some theory on this, see the [[Striker]] page).

MILANs are guided in a SACLOS manner, meaning they follow the crosshair, making them much easier to use than older missiles such as [[SS.11]] or [[9M14|Malyutkas]]. The Marder is also one of the earliest vehicles to get SACLOS missiles, together with [[Ratel 20]] and [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1]], and unlike BMP-1, the Marder is equipped with it stock.

The last thing to note about these is their limited range of just 2 km. Most of its engagements do happen inside this range, but on larger maps such as Maginot Line, it won't hurt checking enemy distance with the laser rangefinder before firing.

As SACLOS missiles, they can be used with some success against ATGM helicopters hovering on the battlefield, but again, checking their range is necessary in order not to waste the few missiles it has.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|3}}
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|4}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG3A1 (7.62 mm)}}

The Marder is armed with two MG3 machine guns. One is coaxial to the Rh202, second is in a small independent turret above the troop compartment.

The MG3 is the standard machine gun for current day Germany. While having a nice rate of fire, they are rifle-calibre and thus have very low penetration, useful only as a deterrent against low flying aircraft and helicopters and to clear obstacles in front of the vehicle. They are almost useless against enemy tanks, and only pose a threat to few open-topped vehicles.

One thing of note is that the second MG3 in its independent turret can only turn in a 90° degree arc on the back of the Marder, thus making it way less practical than the coaxial. It can be used to paint enemies that manage to sneak up on to you from behind, or, if you turn your back against incoming aircraft or helicopters, to increase your firepower against them. Other than that, it only blocks your Rh202 from depressing on the back of your vehicle.

By using the "Select machine gun" key, it is possible to scout enemies with sniper mode from this turret in realistic battles. This allows only the empty rear of the vehicle to be exposed, which, even if shot at, can keep the crew quite safe.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Marder A1- is a pretty decent IFV for its rank, but it is not designed to fight enemy tanks head on.

Best strategy is to either rush favourable positions near capture points in order to spot and counter enemy light vehicles rushing them while occasionally firing your ATGM at high-value targets.

Another good strategy is to go for flanks - most of the time, you will meet enemy light vehicles flanking, and your autocannon shreds them like cheese, denying enemy flanking routes and funnelling them towards your allied tanks. Keep spotting, and save your ATGMs for self-defence, since you will be away from capture points in this scenario and thus unable to rearm. That doesn't mean you can't take out high value targets such as top tier tanks which happen to drive into your sight line.

If forced to CQC or brawl, try to stick to your allies and support them. As soon as you see enemy tank fire, rush him and disable his gun and tracks, making him an easy target for your team mates.

If there are no allies in close proximity, then your speed and ability to fire on the move can be exploited in aggressive pushes, but narrow corridors and streets often present major disadvantages for your lightly armoured IFV; so sticking to ambush tactics might be preferable.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 20 mm cannon is very effective at quickly destroying aircraft, SPAA, and lightly armoured vehicles
** High rate of fire
** Plenty of ammo
** Very fast turret rotation
** 17 degrees of gun depression, 69 degrees of gun elevation, with very fast vertical traverse speed
* Effective MILAN missile
* Very manoeuvrable, high top speed and high power-to-weight ratio

'''Cons:'''

* 20 mm gun is largely ineffective against a large majority of ground vehicles you will face
* Only 4 MILAN missiles
* Thin armour
* Rather tall profile
* MILAN missiles have a rather slow velocity
* Shots to the turret often lead to ammo rack detonation as it is connected to the turret
