== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''' officially designated '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29_Sd.Kfz._Index|Sd.Kfz. Index:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 138''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.47 "Big Guns"]].

The Marder III H is a step above the basic [[Marder III]]. As it is in Germany's open-topped tank destroyer line, its calling card is its superb firepower, in fact, it has a powerful gun for its BR range. APCBC is almost always enough to penetrate and destroy any tank on the battlefield, and with APCR, it has a very high penetration for its battle rating range.

The Marder III Ausf. H mounts a 75 mm gun, slightly surpassing those on the late [[Pz.IV H|Panzer IV's]]⁣; thus its only disadvantages are its weak armour and its open fighting compartment.

Being a modified Pz.38(t) tank, it is one of the more mobile of the German tanks, nearly matching some Russian tanks. The gun is better at close range and the gun shield is curved to the sides, unlike the earlier Marder III.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Always go for "Parts" and "FPE" first to increase the vehicle's survivability. The stock shell is quite effective, so the Ml.Gr 38B HEAT shell and PzGr 40 APCR shell are not priorities either. Instead, focus on mobility upgrades and the Horizontal Drive modification. After that, the order of research will be determined by personal preference.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

Since you are an unprotected tank from behind, try to be as far from the action as possible. If getting close to enemy tanks cannot be prevented (urban maps, allies retreat etc.), then try to face at least a part of your hull against a wall or rock.

Use the horizontal range of the Marder III H as much as possible, the gun traverse is excellent for a turretless SPG. This tank destroyer can be penetrated easily; it has next to no armour at its battle rating. Keep close to other tanks to prevent this. Furthermore, it is imperative to exercise caution when being subjected to artillery fire; a single close hit, especially to your unprotected rear, can result in your demise due to shrapnel. Another important aspect to consider is the fact that ammunition is stored in the nearly unarmoured gun shield. Nearly any vehicle in the game, with the notable exception of the [[GAZ-AAA (4M)]], can penetrate there with ease. To mitigate the risk of ammo rack explosion, bring fewer shells, 33 are more than enough. Another fact to consider is that nearly all shells will over penetrate the superstructure and not explode.

The Marder III H's main APCBC shell, the PzGr 39, is good enough against most standard medium tank models like the M4 Sherman and T-34 from a frontal and slightly angled perspective. However, the penetration performance against sloped armour is only just enough under these circumstances, and an extreme angling beyond 60° on those tanks' part can cause rounds heading towards their front glacis to bounce. This makes up-armoured models like the T-34E and T-34E STZ particularly dangerous, as they can defeat the APCBC shell's sloped performance even at slight angles. While the T-34E has enhanced side armour, the T-34E STZ features increased front armour to bounce shots, so be sure to distinguish the two models for a more profound understanding on where to aim.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Outstanding gun, can knock out frontally common foes like [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]], [[M4]], [[Churchill I]] with a single shot
* Armour protects the crew from MG fire, and is thin enough for explosive AP rounds to over-penetrate
* Fairly small tank destroyer can hide behind most obstacles
* Good -9° gun depression, good for most hills
* Excellent horizontal arc of 30°, allowing hiding easily
* Amazing penetration of APCR, effective even in uptiers

'''Cons:'''

* Vulnerable to HE shell overpressure (e.g. from [[SU-122]])
* Not fully enclosed (exposed crew), vulnerable to MG, bombs, and strafing planes
* Poor +9° gun elevation can be unsuitable in certain situations
* Shells can overpenetrate some lightly-armoured vehicles (e.g. [[ZiS-12 (94-KM)|ZiS-12 94KM]], [[Chi-Ha LG]])

===Development===
After the start of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht found itself in a very dire situation due to the lack of adequate mobile anti-tank weapons, especially after the appearance of the superior Soviet [[T-34 (1941)|T-34]] and [[KV-1 (L-11)|KV-1]] tanks. The only mass-issued dedicated anti-tank gun was the 37 mm PaK36 while the sole widely used tank destroyer was the Panzerjäger I with the Czech 47 mm anti-tank gun. Obsolete tanks and captured vehicles were converted to tank destroyers to enable them to penetrate the modern Soviet tanks at common combat distances. Those were mainly the Marder I (from French Lorraine tracked supply vehicles), the Marder II (from [[Pz.II F|Panzer IIs]]), and the Marder III (from Czech [[Pz.38(t) F|Panzer 38(t)s]]).

===Specifications===
The Marder IIIs, like the rest of the Marder series, were self-propelled guns better suited for fighting enemy armour than the Panzers III and IV then in service. They mounted dedicated anti-tank guns such as the 75 mm PaK40 or captured Soviet 76.2 mm guns, mainly the F-22. All the Marders were open-topped vehicles, leaving the crew exposed to mortar fire, shrapnel, or infantry fire. This weakness was mitigated by the fact that the Marders were supposed to be tank destroyers that are to ambush incoming enemy tanks or shoot them from afar.

The '''Marder III Ausf. H''' used the Panzer 38(t) chassis because it was becoming obsolete, and when new, desperately needed more powerful anti-tank weapons became available, as a stop-gap measure they were mounted on outdated tanks like the Panzer 38(t) first. The finished self-propelled mount had a higher silhouette, which left it more vulnerable, but had a 75 mm PaK40 gun and could hold 38 rounds in the vehicle. A machine gun on the hull was retained for anti-infantry purposes.

The Marder III Ausf. H predecessor, simply named as the [[Marder III]] mounted a rechambered 76.2 gun instead of a PaK40. Another variant created, the Ausf. M, featured a lower silhouette and a better-sloped armour and fighting compartment, despite only holding 27 rounds for the mounted PaK40. A total of 3,472 Marder IIIs and its versions were created or converted from Panzer 38(t) during its production life.

===Combat usage===
The Marder III Ausf. H fought on all fronts of the war, being produced from 1942 to 1945, with 450 Marder III Ausf. H with the PaK40 converted and produced. Using the tested design of the Panzer 38(t), the Marder III was mechanically reliable and had a gun that could take out most allied tanks in the war. The vulnerability of the crew due to lack of armour was its most pressing issue, with only a front shield plate at most 15 mm thick and side plates that can't enclose the crew. This makes it a poor assault vehicle or tank substitute, it allows infantry to easily kill the crew from ambushes. Despite that, with the deteriorating situation during the last years of the war, they were nevertheless used this way and suffered considerable losses.

As its production was underway, Germany already had a few self-propelled assault weapons being produced such as the [[StuG III F|StuG III]] that could have the same anti-tank capabilities, yet was fully armoured, enclosing the crew in adequate armour. This obvious advantage over the open Marder series encouraged the development of a new kind of tank destroyer from the Panzer 38(t) with better armour, which would eventually become the [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)]]. Despite that, the Marders continued to serve to the end of the war.

An antitank vehicle designed by Alkett. The prototype was built in June, 1942. It was produced from November, 1942 to April, 1943 at the BMM factory. The Marder II Ausf.H was also rebuilt from damaged tanks at the Wehrmacht factory in Prilougi using cabins obtained from BMM.

Marder IIIs were used actively on all fronts of World War II. Most of them were used on the Eastern Front.

A total of 613 Marder III Ausf. H tank destroyers were produced.
