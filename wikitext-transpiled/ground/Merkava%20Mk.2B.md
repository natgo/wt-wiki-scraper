== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Merkava Mk.2B''' is the first subvariant of the Merkava Mk.2, which is the second variant of the [[Merkava (Family)|Merkava main battle tank family]]. In comparison to its predecessor, the [[Merkava Mk.1B]], the Merkava Mk.2 variant has enhanced armour protection, a new transmission, and more fuel capacity. Chains with metal balls were added to the Merkava Mk.2's turret rear to provide additional protection against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). The tank comes standard with NBC protection and automatic fire extinguishing equipment. Compared to the standard Merkava Mk.2, the Merkava Mk.2B also included thermal imaging equipment for the gunner and minor changes to the fire-control system. The Merkava Mk.2 was first manufactured in 1983, and it was last produced in 1989, with 580 units constructed in total. It saw service in several local battles, where it performed well. The final Merkava Mk.2 tank was moved to reserve units in 2016. Most of the remaining tanks are currently in storage, though these might potentially be modified to become armoured personnel carriers. They were never exported.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Merkava Mk.2B retains the unique tank design created in Israel. During battles, locating targets is much easier now with thermal imaging equipment for the gunner. To improve crew protection, some composite armour screens are installed throughout the tank, primarily in the turret. In general, the Merkava Mk.2B resembles the Merkava Mk.1B, with good frontal turret armour that can survive a wide range of ammunition. The hull, on the other hand, is not as impressive as the turret. Most tank ammunition will easily penetrate the frontal hull.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The frontal armour on the Merkava Mk.2B is is overall decent in terms of protection. Its turret is compact and smaller than its counterparts at this BR, making it a difficult target to hit  when hull down at range. Moreover, the shape of its turret features a complex design with extreme angles which boast high ricochet chances. This might confuse enemies who are unaccustomed to it, which might cause them to mess up their shots. But as a consequence to the turret being cramped as it is, penetrating shots at the turret's crew compartment might prove to be fatal.

The hull is not as impressive as the turret. On one hand, the lower and upper plates are rather thin, and despite the extreme angle of the upper plate, most APFSDS and chemical rounds will punch through with ease. On the other hand, the Merkava's engine and transmission are conveniently placed at the front to soak up most of the penetrating shot's energy and shrapnel, preventing it from going further into the tank and protecting the crew at the cost of temporary immobilization.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof
|-
| Hull || 60 mm (upper) <br> 90 mm (lower) || 50 mm (behind composite screen) || 70-100 mm (spaced) || 30 mm
|-
| Turret || 65 mm ''Turret front'' <br> 100 mm ''Gun mantlet'' || 110 mm (65+45mm spaced armour) || 110 mm (65+45mm spaced armour) || 30mm

'''Notes:'''

* Side composite screens are 20 mm thick.
* The turret features sides and rear spaced armour.
* Ammo racks are stored in 5-10 mm thick rolled homogeneous armour.
* Armour plates separate the engine and transmission from the fuel tank and crew compartment.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Merkava Mk.2B has decent all around mobility, although it is slower than many other medium tanks at its BR. Turning bleeds speed quickly, and the reverse speed is decent at best.

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,492|rbMinHp=852}}

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
Since the engine, transmission, and fuel tank are all positioned right behind the frontal hull armour and serve the role of additional protection, it is mandatory that the player prioritizes the research of parts and FPE first. Then, the player can get the NVD and LWS/LR or adjustment of fire upgrades for more accurate shots. After that, the player should focus on getting the M111, and they should use it as their main ammo type.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Merkava Mk.2B is built for urban warfare and sniping, and should be played as such roles. The armour and the equipment it features will make it a formidable foe in the battlefield. Use its compact turret to peak from unexpected locations and utilize its excellent 4-20x commander's view to spot enemies from afar.

Enemies that you must be most worried about are the Soviet T-72s and T-64B, as their frontal armour will be a difficult challenge to break through at range when they conceal their lower plate, and their guns are extremely dangerous from any range. The only viable tactic against them is to flank, but you must be very careful not to get flanked yourself, as your side armour can be easily penetrated by even SPAAs.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Excellent hull-down capabilities
* Effective protection of its crew members
* Decent mobility to keep up with most other tanks
* Excellent 4-20x commander's view
* Comes stock with smoke grenades

'''Cons:'''

* Only has rifle-calibre machine guns, ineffective against lightly-armoured vehicles
* Engine compartment is prone to catch on fire
* Prone to getting ammoracked
* Mediocre 8x gunner zoom (commander view balances this disadvantage, but cannot substitute gunner view)
