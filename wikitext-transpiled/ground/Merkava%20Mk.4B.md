== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Following the Merkava Mk.3 design and its improvements, the Merkava entered its fourth generation iteration by upgrading most aspect of the tank, particularly in the crew's ability to observe and react to changing scenarios outside the tank. The Merkava Mk.4 began development in the late 1990s and there were component upgrades like a new fire-control system and hunter-killer system for the commander and gunner, the loader has access to a new 10-round revolving magazine for the ready rounds, modular composite armour is added on all sides, and a more powerful engine. However, the biggest change was upgrades to the electronic systems within the tank, with the computerization allowing each crew station to have screens for information management and observation screen. The commander themselves have access to a battle management system that allow communication of information across different units. This new Merkava Mk.4B would come into service in 2004, and slowly became the primary main battle tank of the Israel Defense Force, gradually replacing the older Mark II and Mark III in service.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Merkava Mk.4B is one of the most recent subvariants of the Merkava main battle tank. With up to 800-1,200 mm of protection on the turret front with its non-explosive reactive armour (NERA), it can effectively resist even hits from anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). Overall, the Merkava Mk.4B is well protected against high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads. However, despite engine improvements, the Merkava Mk.4B becomes progressively heavier, reducing its mobility in comparison to main battle tanks from other nations.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Merkava is not a small tank by any metric, being very wide and tall. This makes you a big target for enemies.

The Merkava is strongly protected against HEAT with up to 800-1,200 mm of protection on the turret front, and the UFP having enough protection with its NERA and engine and transmission blocks to stop a Kornet in its tracks.

However, KE protection may be somewhat lacking with average KE protection on the turret front averaging about 450-550mm of KE protection on the turret front and about 350-450mm of protection on the UFP (engine and transmission protection included) which for top tier is not quite adequate.

The Merkava also features a unique armour layout being the only tank aside from the Strv 122B PLSS to fit NERA not only on front and side of the turret, but also the front and side of the hull too. it is also the only tank to fit NERA on its roof which historically was to defend from roof fired RPGs.

All in all, the Merkava's armour is somewhat lacking in some areas but can more then compensate in others.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=2,325|rbMinHp=1,327}}The mobility of the Merkava is about average for an MBT, easily keeping pass with other MBT's thanks to its improved engine over the Merkava Mk.3.

The Merkava may feel quite snappy at low speeds due to its high torque and good gear ratios, it also has neutral steering which makes urban combat much easier.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Merkava Merkava performs amazingly at range and can still hold its own in a brawl. It plays somewhat similarly to previous Merkavas requiring a more laid back approach in order to well.

The Merkava can perform somewhat well in urban combat thanks to its great reaction speed and decent mobility forwards and backwards. However, keep in mind other tanks such as the T-72B3 and T-80BVM will easily outclass you in a brawl so pick your targets wisely.

The Merkava has arguably some of the best optics for an MBT in-game due to the commanders sight being very high up and with great zoom at 14x max, and great thermals. this will allow you to play as a sniper on long range maps, being able to acquire and pick off targets with ease as you can play ridges and hills to your advantage.

Also make sure to keep close attention to your Laser Warning System (LWS) and the direction it is alerting you to. As this will alert you of drones, helicopters and tanks, therefore giving you time to throw smoke and take cover from an ATGM or find the direction of a tank lasing you so you can return fire. A good way to tell if its a either a tank or a helicopter/drone locking you is that helicopter and drone locks will always continuously lock you whereas a tank may only give a short 1-2 seconds alert.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has access to 2nd generation thermals for both the gunner and commander
* Excellent mobility, even in reverse
* Great and competitive ammo selection
* LWS gives great protection against tanks, helicopters, and drones alike

'''Cons:'''

* Very vulnerable to most attacks due to a noticeable lack of composite armour or ERA
* Slower reload speed than its NATO counterparts
* Quite big and can be a more appealing target then other tanks
