== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Merkava Mk.4M''' is the third and last subvariant of the Merkava Mk.4, which is the fourth variant of the [[Merkava (Family)|Merkava main battle tank family]]. It is an enhanced subvariant of the standard Merkava Mk.4, outfitted with the Trophy active protection system (APS). Also known as the Merkava Mk.4M Windbreaker, this tank began production in 2009. In 2011, the first brigade outfitted with these tanks was declared operational. It saw action in the same year and successfully resisted an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) attack. Since then, the updated Merkava Mk.4M tanks equipped with the Trophy APS have intercepted dozens of rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) such as the RPG-29 and ATGMs such as the Kornet and Metis-M.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Merkava Mk.4M is the ultimate subvariant of the Merkava Mk.4. Players can lead assaults into modern battlefields without fear of ATGMs from both ground vehicles and helicopters, thanks to the Trophy APS. The Merkava Mk.4M is a truly modern main battle tank designed for even the most intense conflict, providing the finest protection and firepower to confront any adversary. Players should bear in mind, however, that the Trophy APS does not give unlimited protection, and hence the tank should not stay out in the open for long during combat.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful APFSDS round
* Trophy System will stop most missiles
* HE-TF can help with fighting against helicopters
* Generation 2 thermal for gunner and commander
* 200mm of NERA on the turret roof will protect against HE shells striking the optics and sometimes even against artillery
* 400mm of NERA side armor above the tracks. Enough to stop most HEAT-FS and autocannons.
* Can reverse at 64kph.

'''Cons:'''

* Engine is at the front of the tank and any penetrating hit to the UFP will result in a stranded tank
* Upper front plate is weaker than those of other nations' tanks
* Slower reload than most top tier manual loaded tanks. 8.7 secs stock, 6.7 ace.
* depression of only 7°

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Due to the relatively small size of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) compared to some of its potential opponents, Israel's military doctrine is ever focused on protecting its highly-trained personnel from harm during combat. This is typically achieved by fielding advanced technology designed to reduce casualties. Nowhere is this seen more clearly than in the design of the Merkava tank. Beyond its rare configuration, which places the engine at the front to soak up penetrating rounds, as well as the "Hairs of Shulamit" passive protective chains around the rear of the tank's turret, in the early 2000s Israel began simultaneous development of two Active Protection Systems (APS) designed to intercept and destroy incoming anti-tank weaponry.

One of these two systems is called "Me'il Ruach" (Windbreaker Jacket, or simply Windbreaker), which was developed by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The Windbreaker system contains a high-precision radar and four flat-panel antennas, designed to detect incoming projectiles such as HEAT rounds, ATGMs, RPGs, and any other "slow" chemical warheads. Once an incoming projectile is detected, the system quickly calculates its exact flight trajectory and determines the optimum timing for interception. Two launchers on either side of the turret can quickly rotate in any direction to fire a pack of Explosively-Formed Projectiles (EFP) at the warhead and detonate it before it can hit the tank. This is effectively a very tight shotgun blast of tiny pellets that triggers the warhead by directly hitting it. If the system determines that the enemy projectile will not hit the tank, it does not fire the pellets at all.

The extreme accuracy of the radar, the precise trajectory calculation and the tight cone of pellets not only increase the chance of detonating the warhead to approximately 90-95% (100% in operational history), but also significantly reduce the risk to any friendly infantry who may be near the tank when the system fires. This was set as a prerequisite before development ever began. Furthermore, the system alerts the tank crew to the direction the attack came from, allowing them to return fire quickly and effectively.

The Windbreaker system was first installed onto a platoon of operational [[Merkava Mk.4B|Merkava Mk.4 tanks]] in 2009. The upgraded model was renamed '''Merkava Mk.4M''', with the M being the first letter in the system's Hebrew name ("Me'il Ruach"). The IDF's 401st Armored Regiment was the first to be fully equipped with Merkava Mk.4Ms in 2012. Today, all new Israeli-produced tanks are Merkava Mk.4Ms; all Merkava Mk.4 tanks in service in the IDF have been upgraded to Merkava Mk.4M standards; and the Windbreaker system is also known to feature on some older [[Merkava_Mk.3D_(USA)|Merkava Mk.3D models]].

Windbreaker became the first fully-operational hard-kill APS in any Western-aligned army, and to this day is the only mass-produced system of this type outside of Russia and China. It was first tested in battle in 2011, when it intercepted an RPG fired by Hamas combatants at a Merkava Mk.4M on the border of the Gaza Strip. During Operation Protective Edge in 2014, Windbreaker systems reportedly intercepted a total of 15 enemy warheads, including Metis, Konkurs and Kornet ATGMs. As of 2023, the system has maintained a 100% operational success rate in combat.

Windbreaker's development quickly drew the attention of the United States Army, which first purchased a light version of the system for protecting its Oshkosh M-ATVs. In the United States military, the system is named "Trophy". In 2017, the U.S. Army ordered 100 heavy-model Trophy units for installation on [[M1A2 Abrams]] tanks, enough to outfit an entire regiment. In 2019 the Army ordered enough systems to outfit three additional regiments. Germany was also an early adopter of the Trophy system, installing it into its state-of-the-art Leopard 2A7A1. Reportedly, the British army is currently planning on installing the Trophy system into its future Challenger 3 tank, though trials are proceeding concurrently for other APS systems.
