== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|試製七糎半対戦車自走砲「ナト」|Shisei-Nana-Senchimētoru Hantai-Sensha Jisōhō [Na-To]}}) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]].

The Type 5 Na-To is a rather traditional tank destroyer of a simple vehicle chassis with a gun pasted on top. It is highly vulnerable to many battlefield weapons due to its weak overall armour, but if it can get the jump on an enemy, it can wreck havoc. Thus, one should not play the Na-To as a front-line weapon but as a sniper far back behind the front lines. This will ensure the Na-To will not become a priority target and also to maximize the gun's long-range capacity to take out targets. Watch frequently traveled roads and choke points for enemy, then blast them away before retreating to reload in case they are still active after the first shot.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour
- Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mount)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

With the [[Lightweight Type I Model II (75 mm)|Lightweight Type I Model II tank gun]], the Na-To presents a lethal gun that can penetrate all the the tanks at its 3.3 BR range. Assuming it is not upped by another vehicle in the line-up with a higher BR, the worst heavy tank the Na-To could face are the Soviet [[KV-1S]] and British [[Churchill Mk III]], both with front armour easily penetrable by the Na-To's 75 mm gun at standard ranges without taking angling into consideration. However, the thin armour of the Na-To does mean that any tank it faces could defeat the Na-To, so always get the first shot off at the enemy.

Playing the Na-To as a sniper support from a long distance from the front-line will provide the Na-To increased survivability and also potentially more targets to aim at than with its limited traverse arc up close. If long range is not possible, keep the Na-To stationed at a cover's corner watching an enemy's frequented area. As soon as one shows up, blast away before retreating to cover.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- High penetrating 75 mm cannon can pretty much destroy any vehicle in its BR range.
- Gun can traverse a rather wide angle to the side.
- Six-man crew can provide some degree of crew loss before a crew knockout occurs.
- Rear ammo racks can lessen the chance of front penetrations detonating it.
- Excellent reloading speed for a gun of such high penetration and damage.
- The armour is sometimes too thin for APHE fuses to go off, causing little to no damage inside the vehicle.

'''Cons:'''

- Large vehicle, large target.
- Paper-thin armour of overall 12 mm.
- Front engine an easy target that will immobilize vehicle if hit.
- Open-top crew compartment exposes crew to artillery and airstrikes.
- All the crew are rather lined up, leading to shells able to knock out 2-4 crew members at a time.
- Two prominent ammo racks on the rear sides of the cabin, easy targets to ammo-rack kill.

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Type 5 Na-to was a tank destroyer based on the Type 4 Chi-So armored medium tracked carrier developed in 1945. It used a 75 mm tank gun, known as the Type I 75 mm. This was a lighter version of the Type II 75 mm tank gun used by the Chi-To and Chi-Ri.

The Na-To had two prototypes, known simply as the Na-To I and Na-To II. The Na-To I used a variant of the Type I 75 mm gun known as the "Type 1 75 mm Model I". The Na-To II used the Type I 75 mm Model II.

Following trials, the Na-To II was selected over the Na-To I to be mass-produced. An order was placed for 200 vehicles to be made, but by the end of the war only 70 of them were started, with none reaching completion.
