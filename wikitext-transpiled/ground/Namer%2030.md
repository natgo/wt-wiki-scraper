== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Until the early 2000s, Israel's main armoured personnel carrier was the American M113, which had been adopted in the early 1960s. It became apparent that the vehicle was vulnerable to modern battlefield threats, so engineers began work on developing a new IFV based on the [[Merkava Mk.1B|Merkava Mk.1]] tank. After development and successful trials, the new vehicle, named '''Namer''' (נמ"ר - "Leopard", also an abbreviation of ''Nagmash Merkava'' - Merkava APC), officially entered service with the IDF in 2008.

In its production version, the Namer is equipped with a 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun or a 40 mm Mk.19 grenade launcher; however, in 2016 an experimental modification of the Namer based on the [[Merkava Mk.4B|Merkava Mk.4]] tank instead of the Merkava Mk.1 appeared with a Samson RCWS-30 combat module from Rafael, and Spike ATGM launchers. However, due to budget constraints, the project was shelved.

Introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]], the Namer 30 is a rather unusual IFV in its class because, being based on the Merkava Mk.4 chassis, its vital modules and crew are concealed by a massive engine compartment and combined armour in the front of the hull. The Namer is equipped with an unmanned turret with a rapid-firing 30 mm Bushmaster autocannon and a pair of Spike-LR2 ATGM launchers, which give the vehicle the ability to engage armoured targets at distances up to 4 km. The presence of an auto-tracking system will also allow it to shoot down helicopters or low-flying aircraft. However, it does not have the most outstanding mobility.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour of the Namer is based off the [[Merkava (Family)|Merkava Mk4]], inheriting the same spacious design and external composite. Due to this, the Namer's armour is substantially better than other contemporary IFVs and light tanks. The front is resistant to almost all autocannon rounds and most chemical weapons. However, most large-calibre APFSDS rounds will be able to reliably penetrate the frontal armour.

The side armour of the Namer will be penetrated by most MBT rounds and most autocannon APFSDS rounds will find their way through the armour under prolonged fire. There are also external composite skirts which offer some protection.

The roof armour is relatively thick, with the crew compartment being virtually immune to strafing aircraft. The overhead weapons mount does act as an overpressure trap, and HE rounds that hit the RCWS will sometimes overpressure the crew.

Crew survivability is relatively good, but APFSDS shots to the UFP that spall enough will most likely take out two of the crew, resulting in the vehicle's destruction. There is a large amount of space in the vehicle towards the rear that can act as a dead zone for shells. Make sure to use Crew Replenishment on capture points if there are only two of the three crew remaining, as the Namer is extremely vulnerable to one-shots with only two crew left.

'''Notes:''' <!-- Any additional notes which the user needs to be aware of -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The mobility of the Namer is worse compared to other IFVs and light tanks due to it weighing a monstrous 61 tons. Most MBTs and almost all smaller vehicles will be faster than the player at the battle rating. Flanking is a possibility, but keep in mind that other light vehicles will arrive at areas before the player gets there.

The reverse speed is good, allowing the player to get out of most sticky situations relatively quickly. Another note is that the Namer unfortunately does not inherit the reverse gearbox on the Merkava 4 MBT which allows it to travel at the same speed in both directions.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|Bushmaster 2 Mk.44 (30 mm)}}

The 30 mm Bushmaster is the primary weapon of the Namer, with access to APDS, APFSDS, and HEI-T round options. There are two belts with 100 rounds each in a storage box on the opposite side of the Spike-LR launchers. The Namer will have no problem penetrating the side armour of vehicles with the APFSDS belt. The APFSDS is also more than sufficient to destroy gun barrels and tracks.

Shooting down enemy aircraft is also relatively easy at closer ranges due to the IRST feature. Once locked, a lead indicator will appear showing where the player should aim. In conjunction with the HEI-T ammunition, the Namer can work as an improvised SPAA against close-range aircraft.

Always make sure to keep an eye on the amount of cannon ammo left, as it is quite easy to burn through all 200 rounds during fighting. The 30 mm ammunition can be replenished on friendly capture zones.

Since all of the cannon ammunition is mounted externally, a shot to the cannon belt will render the 30 mm Bushmaster unusable, leaving the player with the Spike-LRs and the coaxial MG as their only weapons.

{{main|Spike-LR2}}

The Namer 30 is equipped with four Spike-LR missiles, with two being loaded in the launch tubes and two being stored in the hull. The Spike-LRs are best used against long-range targets. Due to the fire-and-forget capability, players can shoot off a missile at longer ranges at the start of matches on open maps while moving to objectives.

The Spike-LRs are inconsistent against armoured vehicles, with only 700 mm of tandem chemical penetration. Prioritise unarmoured/light vehicles for better efficacy.

Keep in mind that the Spike-LR has a lofting path, meaning that the missile will travel upwards immediately after being fired before aiming downwards to hit the target. Therefore, the Spike-LR may not work against enemies at close ranges since the missile will be launched over the intended target.

'''Pros:'''

* Very good armour compared to other contemporary light tanks, such as the BMP-2M and the M3A3 Bradley
** Resistant to autocannons and most ATGMs frontally, being based on the Merkava 4 chassis
* Excellent hull-down capabilities with good gun depression
* Spike-LRs are fire-and-forget ATGMs, no manual guidance of the missile required
** Able to be used against helicopters and slow-flying aircraft, but will be fooled by flares due to IR guidance

'''Cons:'''

* Armour can be penetrated by most large-calibre APFSDS rounds at the battle rating
* Spike ATGMs are fairly inconsistent against armoured targets with a relatively low ammo count (4 missiles total)
* Slower than other contemporary light tanks due to the large size and heavy weight (61 tons) of the Namer 30
* Overhead weapon station is an overpressure trap for HE shells

Up until the early 2000s, Israel's primary APC was still the American-built M113 which first entered service in the early 1960s. Becoming increasingly clear that the vehicle was susceptible to the threats of the modern battlefield, engineers began work on developing a successor based on the Merkava tank. Following rapid development and successful testing, the Namer officially entered service with the IDF in 2008. In 2016, the Namer underwent an experimental modification which saw it outfitted with a remote controlled 30 mm turret and Spike missile launchers.
