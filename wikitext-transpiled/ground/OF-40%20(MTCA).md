== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 "Imperial Navy"]] as a [[wt:en/news/6201-shop-of-40-mk-2-mtca-pre-order-en|premium pack]] in the Gaijin store. It was removed from sale after the [[wt:en/news/7674-shop-may-sale-en|2022 May sale]], and was reintroduced as a Golden Eagle {{ge}} premium in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The OF-40 (MTCA) has very little in the way of armour - effectively identical to both OF-40 models in the tech tree - with just enough to protect its crew from most frontal attacks from light autocannons - however even then the turret ring and some other small weak spots are reasonably vulnerable. Despite this, the OF-40's steep constructional angles may on occasion bounce even APFSDS rounds, while the (minimalist) spaced armour in the turret may absorb some less-powerful chemical rounds. Regardless, the safest approach is to avoid enemy fire whenever possible.

The OF-40's survivability is comparable to the [[Leopard A1A1 (L/44)]], as most of the vehicle's ammunition is stored in the hull adjacent to the driver, with a small portion of the ammunition being placed in primary stowage below the loader. The unfortunate result is that almost any hull penetration in the front half of the vehicle is liable to destroy ammunition with a high chance of detonation. Additionally, the turret crew are very poorly spaced and a well-placed round can easily knock out the entire crew simultaneously.

The result of the lack of survivability and armour is that the OF-40 (MTCA) is not viable as a front-line MBT, but rather should be played in flanking or sniping roles.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled Homogeneous Armour - Hull and Turret
* High Hardness Rolled Armour - Turret
* Rubber-Fabric Screens - Sideskirts

'''Notes:'''

* The turret sides use spaced armour, and are therefore stronger than they appear in the armour viewer.
* Beneath the angled outer portion of the gun mantlet is a curved 45 mm plate.
* There are 10 mm rubber-fabric screens protecting the upper suspension.
* The rear of the turret has 5 mm of structural steel in addition to the base armour.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,550|rbMinHp=884}}

The OF-40 (MTCA) has an improved engine over its tech tree predecessors, offering its driver a notably improved power-to-weight ratio of 23.26 hp/ton (RB, spaded), relative to the [[OF-40 Mk.2A|Mk.2A]]'s 19.3. This is a significant improvement that is easily noticeable, and the MTCA comfortably displays better mobility characteristics than most of its contemporaries.

With an upgraded 1,000 hp engine, the OF-40 (MTCA) is more manoeuvrable, similarly to other third generation main battle tanks. The OF-40 (MTCA) will get you to a better position than the rest of the tanks if not in an uptier situation.

The main weaponry on this tank is the same as the [[Leopard (Family)|Leopard family]]. DM23 APFSDS shells are recommended for engaging armoured targets while you should also carry several M456 HEATFS and M416 smoke shells for special purposes.

The armour is not upgraded from the rest of OF-40 family. Although the OF-40 family has spaced armour all around the turret, you will not want to use this feature. While it is significantly more effective than the Leopard 1's turret armour, all main battle tanks can still penetrate you from all angles with ease using kinetic energy shells. The hull is as fragile as other Leopards, which is another reason why you don't want to take a shot.

Although the OF-40 (MTCA) has night vision devices, it lacks thermal sights for both the gunner and the commander. You might want to get in cover such as bushes and buildings first before opening fire. Avoid sitting in the opening at all time, always get in cover after shooting.

In summary, OF-40 MTCA is a mixture of the OF-40 Mk. 2 and the TAM: it is a great tank in mobility and fire power. However, lacking armour and thermal camera limits its usage on certain maps around open areas.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* One of the most mobile and speedy main battle tanks of its rank; notably more mobile than the Leopard A1A1 and L/44.
* Great gun handling - vertical and horizontal turret/gun speeds are some of the best
* Laser rangefinder and excellent optics permit easy sniping and long-range shots
* Plentiful selection of ammo; APDS, APFSDS, HESH, HEATFS, and smoke shells, handy for marking enemies or blocking their line of sight
* Spaced turret armour can save you from some autocannon fire, the front and sides are immune to HESH, and AP shot can bounce if angled
* 12.7 mm (.50 cal) commander's roof gun with 1,080 round ammo count is great for disabling light vehicles and fending off harassing planes and helicopters

'''Cons:'''

* Rather large profile; the turret is quite large while peeking over a hilltop or ridgeline
* Low ready rack capacity; if carrying more than 20 shells, the spare rounds are placed next to the driver in the lightly-armoured hull
* Not having thermals at its high BR limits its potential in night battles as most of the opposition has access to thermals

The history of the OTO Melara OF-40 began during the late stages of the Cold War. Italy had begun to develop a new MBT for the first time since the Second World War, known as the OTO Melara 'Leone'. This tank was being jointly co-developed by Italy and Germany, based on the Leopard but with some notable differences, such as the turret and armament being made by OTO Melara. The design didn't generate enough interest and ultimately the project wouldn't go further than a single prototype. However, this would kickstart OTO Melara to begin developing tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles once again. One of their earliest being the OF-40, O standing for OTO, F standing for Fiat and 40 standing for the approximate weight of the tank in tons.

Unlike what many people believe, this tank was not based on any sort of Leopard, although it's evident by some of the design features that it would incorporate, that it at least drew inspiration from the Leopard. OTO Melara dealt with the armament, turret and FCS, whilst Fiat dealt with the hull, engine and transmission. In regards to the armament, it used a OTO Melara 105 mm rifled gun which was able to shoot most NATO standard ammunition, which included various HEAT, APDS, and HE rounds. Other armament included machine guns installed on top of the turret, either 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm. In terms of armour, the vehicle would offer slightly better protection than the Leopard tanks of the era, but it wasn't anything special. It also had access to smoke dischargers in case there was a need to disengage from a firefight. The base variant of the vehicle would use an MTU MB 838 KA 50 diesel engine, which allowed the vehicle to reach speeds of up to 60 km/h.

After a few prototypes were completed, it was time to market the vehicle. Initially they attempted to sell it to the Italian army, however it didn't go well due to them already having access to many Leopard MBTs in service. So they instead began to market the vehicle to various Middle Eastern nations, one being the UAE. The UAE at the time didn't really have any decent main battle tank force, and although the OF-40 might not have been the best during the era, they still ended up buying the vehicle and putting it in service. The tank would finally go ahead for full-scale production. According to some sources, the UAE ended up getting up to 100 units in total, alongside a new variant of the vehicle in the ARV variant.

Over time, the OF-40 Mk.1 began to show its age, thus a new variant was created which would be known as the OF-40 Mk.2. This vehicle would have a set of upgrades from the base variant, including the addition of a stabilizer, an LLTV and also new sensors and updates to the FCS (updated to use the Galileo OG14L2A), such as the addition of a ballistic computer. The commander sight however was kept from the previous variant, being the French-made SFIM VS 580-B. The OF-40 Mk.2 would also serve in the UAE, where all previous Mk.1 variants would be retrofitted to the more modern variant.

A very rare and obscure variant would be the OF-40 MTCA. The OF-40 (Mk.2) MTCA would be modified to allow for the installation of the Fiat MTCA V-12 1,000 hp engine, which increased the tank's speed by quite a lot. Only one OF-40 would receive such a package, it is unknown what happened after the tests.

Other variants include the Palmaria and OTOMATIC, both based on a modified OF-40 hull. There was also the OF-40 Thetis, an OF-40 Mk.2 fitted with thermal imaging devices and extra armour, and lastly there was also the OF-40 Mk.3, an OF-40 which used the Palmaria hull with the Ariete preserie turret. Currently, all OF-40s in service with the UAE have been put into storage. One was converted to an HIFV by a company known as Sabiex. The UAE said that they wanted to donate these tanks to Kosovo but nothing materialized. Other OF-40 tanks and their variants currently reside in the 'Museo Della Melara' in La Speiza, Italy.
