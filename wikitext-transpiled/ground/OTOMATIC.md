== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened to '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

The OTOMATIC is a radar-equipped SPAAG that is capable of shooting proximity fused frag rounds and can destroy planes even in a single, well-aimed shot. Shooting down aircraft should be the primary use of this vehicle at least until APFSDS rounds are unlocked, so staying in a cap zone is recommended, as the unit doesn't carry a lot of ammo (90 shells for a cannon with a 0.5s reload). When APFSDS are available, the OTOMATIC may defend capture points against enemy tanks as well, while still dealing with aircraft, or it can switch to a more mobile, MBT-like playstyle, mostly thanks to the excellent penetration of the sabot rounds and the two-axis stabiliser.

{{main|OTO Breda Cannone da 76/62 (76 mm)}}

The OTOMATIC is armed with the most famous naval autocannon, the OTO Breda Cannone da 76/62. This specific configuration is the Compact version, meaning the carousel is smaller for size reduction but with an increase in rate of fire. This particular gun, if already used in vessels, has one of the best trade-off in accuracy, stopping power and range. Different from other cannons, the 76 mm is the biggest anti-air calibre yet the smallest calibre for modern vehicles. The version mounted on the OTOMATIC is set to super-rapid fire, speeding the rate of fire from 60 RPM to 120 RPM. This has its own pros and cons. From one side you have a tremendous stopping power which can deal with all threats in seconds, including ground. However, on the other side, you devour ammunition when doing continuous fire, getting from 90 shells to 60 in a matter of seconds.

==== Ammunition ====
The OTOMATIC has access to both anti-air and anti-tank ammunition capable of dealing with a high variety of threats, from lightly-armoured IFVs to heavily armoured MBTs.

'''SAPOM''' - The Semi Armour-Piercing High Explosive Incendiary rounds has a multipurpose capabilities with a little bit of everything. It has a nice trade-off between anti-air and anti-tank capabilities due to the explosive mass and armour penetration. However, the SAPOM is not really suggested for anything rather than anti-tank roles as the HE-VT* is more than capable of dealing with enemy threats. It should be noted most of the targets faced can be killed from the sides if shot between the road wheels in the lower half of the chassis (in case for NATO tanks), engine deck (will only cause fire and damage to transmission), Gunner's Primary Sight (in case of M1 Abrams and XM-1s). When it comes to dealing with Russian targets (the most generally armoured MBTs in the game), SAPOM should be fire almost at the ground hitting the lowest part of the chassis. It is recommended to destroy their tracks and barrels in order to let friendly units take them out for this reason. SAPOM is capable of destroying all lightly-armoured targets seen at the battle-rating (IFVs, SPAAs, etc).

'''APFSDS''' - The dart ammunition has a full anti-tank role though it can be used for anti-air roles, however it is not recommended. It has decent penetration and stopping power as a dart and is more than capable with dealing enemy tanks. It is able to destroy enemy targets in one hit if it's a well placed shot. Ammunition should be targeted with the APFSDS as the low amount of ammunition carrying can make it run out of APFSDS before destroying the enemy. Trapshots are suggested (driver's port, cupola, mantlets, etc).

'''HE-MOM''' - The High Explosive Variable Time fuse proximity shell has a full anti-air role with zero anti-tank role. Thanks to the high calibre, the HE is able to carry a proximity fuse with a lethal explosive mass, making it capable of destroying all aerial threats with one or two hits. Trigger discipline is recommended as, due to the fast fire rate, the OTOMATIC can spend the whole ammunition reserve really fast. Thanks to being a big shell, most enemy helicopters and aircraft will not redirect course when being fired at until it's too late compared to the continuous fire smaller calibre SPAA have (25, 30, 35, 40 mm, etc). They do not trigger Missile Alert Warning systems, making them the ultimate helicopter killer.

===Radars===
{{main|SMA VPS-A05|SMA VPS-A06}}
The OTOMATIC is equipped with a [[SMA VPS-A05]] search radar and a [[SMA VPS-A06]] tracking radar; both radars are located on the top of the turret, with the SMA VPS-A05 being mounted on an arm at the rear, and the SMA VPS-A06 being mounted further forwards on the left hand side of the turret roof. The radar system is capable of tracking a target while scanning, but can only track targets within a 180° arc from the front of the turret. Both radar can be folded.

The OTOMATIC is one of the more role-diverse SPAA in the game, akin to that of the ADATS with its anti-air/anti-tank missiles. However, the OTOMATIC can practice these diverse roles without needing to notify the enemy of what role it is prior to an engagement. The {{PAGENAME}} has the mobility, speed, armour and electronics to make it one of the best SPAA or anti-tank vehicle, depending on what the commander or battlefield situation dictate.

The OTOMATIC has a big ammo rack with three types of ammunition for all types of players, for those who want to be deadly to only aircraft and control the skies as quickly as possible, and for those who want to carry out as much destruction as possible regardless if they want to go anti-air or anti-tank. The only drawback is that the OTOMATIC can only carry 12 APFSDS rounds. The recommended round load is 50 HE-VT*, 20 SAPOM, and 12 APFSDS for both anti-air and anti-tank capabilities. Each of these rounds are well-suited for the targets they are specialized to fight against.

=== HE-VT* ===
This round makes nailing aircraft such an easy task, though it has its pros and cons compared to missiles that other high-ranking SPAA are using. As a con, a HE-VT* shell carries less explosive power, cannot be guided, and has a slower muzzle velocity compared to missiles. However, the HE-VT* as a shell will not trigger the aircraft's Missile Approach Warning system (MAW) and so the enemy may be caught unaware of an incoming 76 mm HE-VT* shell if they do not see it coming. The only visual cue they would have is the flying tracer round, compared to a missile smoke streak that may be traced to the firing SPAA vehicle. The larger number of HE-VT* shells carried also means the {{PAGENAME}} can quickly follow-up a shot if the first shot missed, without too much worry on ammunition waste.

This round helps make the {{PAGENAME}} one of the more reliable SPAA at the top-rank battlefield. A missile would cause hovering aircraft like helicopters to simply find cover as soon as the MAW is activated. Top-rank SPAA that uses missile also have a reliance to their radar lock, as it must maintain that lock for the missile to track and hit the target. The {{PAGENAME}} also has access to thermal sights and a laser rangefinder to help locate aircraft in the air and find their range without use of the radar. With this, the {{PAGENAME}} can track a helicopter and find their distance without the enemy helicopter being aware that they are within the {{PAGENAME}}'s sights and firing range.

=== SAPOM ===
This round provides some flexibility in the usage of the {{PAGENAME}}. It is a Semi Armour-Piercing High-Explosive Incendiary (SAPHEI) round that does not have the penetration values of a likewise APCBC round, while also not having as much high-explosives as a dedicated HE shell. However, this round in the 76 mm calibre does still present some general-purpose uses. While there is enough high-explosives in the shell to use against an aircraft, the presence of the HE-VT* shell makes this role redundant by a more capable shell. The shell can fight enemy armoured fighting vehicles, but a maximum penetration of 60 mm at point-blank range means this round will struggle against any main battle tanks fought at the {{PAGENAME}}'s battle-rating. Nevertheless, as the only armour-piercing round available to the {{PAGENAME}} before it unlocks the APFSDS, it must be used with caution, patience, and practice for maximum efficiency.

Arguably one of the best use of the SAPOM round is as a reserve so that the valuable 12 APFSDS that can be carried in the {{PAGENAME}} is not wasted; or in the worst case all HE-VT* is spent. As such, its use should be reserved to fighting lightly-armoured vehicles, when out of APFSDS against ground units, or out of HE-VT* against air targets.

====Fighting Specific Tanks with SAPOM====
'''NATO allegiance MBTs (Leopard, Abrams, Leclerc, etc.)''':

*When facing from the front:
**Aim at the main gun to disable the tank's firepower. After that is disabled, aim for the tracks to immobilize the vehicle. Then allow a more capable ally destroy the enemy tank.

*When facing from the side/rear:
**Aim at medium lower section of a tank's hull sides, in between the road wheels where the armour is generally weaker.
**If the {{PAGENAME}} is positioned to be somewhere towards the vehicle's rear, aim instead at the turret bustle ammunition rack. No tank has enough armour to withstand multiple hits to the ammo rack. Aiming at engine deck is worthless if gun is not disabled.

'''CSTO allegiance MBTs (T-80, T-90, ZTZ-99, etc.)'''

*When facing from the front:
**Aim at the main gun to disable the tank's firepower. After that is disabled, aim for the tracks to immobilize the vehicle. Then allow a more capable ally destroy the enemy tank.

*When facing from the side/rear:
** Unfortunately, CSTO MBTs are often more well-armoured at the sides than NATO tanks, enough so to resist SAPOM rounds more easily with slight angling. As such, an attack with SAPOM rounds should not be attempted even from the sides.
** If able to hit the vehicle's rear, the only place of worth the {{PAGENAME}} may penetrate is the engine deck. Shoot there to disable the enemy's mobility, but make sure to disable the enemy's gun as it reacts otherwise it may destroy the {{PAGENAME}}.

'''Generally speaking, try and avoid combat with CSTO MBTs if the {{PAGENAME}} only has SAPOM rounds available, unless it is mission-critical that the enemy tank must be immobilized or disabled.'''

=== APFSDS ===
This is probably the most used round by the OTOMATIC when it is being used for anti-tank purposes. This is the same round the Rooikat uses, meaning it is a reliable round with good capabilities, but does require trigger discipline, situational awareness and knowledge of the enemy tank's "anatomy" to make every single round count as there are only 12 round carried. While the APFSDS round has nowhere enough penetration power to deal with enemy MBT, it does have enough to penetrate weakpoints and from favourable angles of attack.

'''NATO allegiance MBTs (Leopard, Abrams, Leclerc, etc.)''':

*When facing from the front:
**As explained above, utilize the terrain to the {{PAGENAME}}'s advantage against the enemy. However, a frontal encounter is highly discouraged

*When facing from the side/rear:
**Aim at the hull ammo racks
***Leopard/Leclerc/Type 90: Next to driver
***Abrams: Almost at engine deck, a small wall ammo rack
**If able to hit the enemy from an angle closer to their rear, aim exclusively at turret bustle ammo rack. APFSDS will over-penetrate and make the blast shields useless.

'''CSTO allegiance MBTs (T-80, T-90, ZTZ-99, etc.)'''

*When facing from the front:
**As explained above, utilize the terrain to the {{PAGENAME}}'s advantage against the enemy. However, a frontal encounter is highly discouraged

*When facing from the side/rear:
**Aim at the hull ammo racks
***T-64s/T-80s: any hit to the side. Ammo rack is in an "L" shape, making ammo rack hits easy
***T-72s/T-90: aim in a manner like if the target was a T-80, but closer to the ground due to ammo rack closer to the ground as it is in a "=" shape
**If able to hit the enemy from an angle closer to their rear, aim exclusively at anywhere is possible to hit. Preferably the turret rear to disable critical modules or even hit an ammunition rack if there is any.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Radar guidance system
* Equipped by default with HE-VT fuse shells capable of annihilating aircraft within 1-3 indirect hits. Direct hits usually destroy the aircraft in one blow
* Excellent scoped zoom for an SPAA (8.0x to 16.1x)
* Immense fire rate for the gun calibre; 120 RPM for a 76 mm gun
* Two axis stabiliser
* APFSDS can penetrate up to 311 mm, enough to destroy any top-rank MBT with a well-placed shot
* Equipped with SAPHEI shells, capable of dealing with many light tanks and the XM-1
* Capable of taking out long-range helicopters with ammunition which does not explode until approximately 4.6 km away, allowing for shots well past the radar tracking range
* The OF-40 chassis provides reasonable protection and mobility (especially compared to the M163 and ZSU-23-4)
* Fantastic turret rotation and elevation speed
* Generation 1 thermals for the gunner - makes spotting enemy aircraft, helicopters and tanks a much easier task
* Fear factor - Enemy pilots who know there is an OTOMATIC around will fall back in a far more cautious playstyle and are less likely to attack friendly ground vehicles in the open
* Large cannon breech - can soak up shrapnel, thereby protecting the turret crew

'''Cons:'''

* Turret has immensely thin  armour, can be penetrated by other SPAA as well as secondary cannons from the MBT-70 or AMX-40
* Several turret-mounted ammo racks that are almost impossible ''not'' to hit
* APFSDS rounds are a tier IV modification
* APFSDS capacity limited to 12 rounds
* APFSDS has limited accuracy at range
* Massive profile, straightforward to spot and shoot
* This vehicle's reputation precedes it, enemies will prioritise its destruction
* SAPHEI penetration is abysmal, and 62 mm consistently fails to penetrate the sides of Abrams or T-64s/T-72s/T-80s
* First-stage ammo stowage capacity of 29 rounds. The gun's high rate of fire will empty this quickly
* There must be at least one shell in the first-stage stowage to fire the gun
* Each round must be loaded into the first-stage stowage individually. This massively increases reload times if the stowage is empty
* The gun can only elevate 60 degrees. This is below average for an SPAA vehicle of this tier.
* Rate of fire decreases when your loader is knocked out
* A hit to the turret, even if it doesn't kill the crew, will always result in a destroyed breech due to the sheer amount of space the breech takes up in the turret

Development of the OTOMATIC SPAAG began during the mid 1980s as a private venture of the OTO Melara company. The basic concept behind the OTOMATIC was to take the successful 76 mm Super Rapido utility cannon used on naval vessels and fit it to a suitable mobile platform in order to create a long-range SPAA vehicle that would outmatch similar designs such as the German Gepard or British Marksman system. Although a challenging feat, Italian engineers eventually succeeded in this endeavour, creating a vehicle that wasn't only up to the latest technological standards but also perfectly suited, and even exceeded, various NATO requirements of the time. The first prototype of the OTOMATIC was ready for testing in the late 1980s. Intended to be compatible with a large number of NATO vehicles of the time, the OTOMATIC, similarly to the British Marksman system, was tested on several hulls and it was planned to be capable of fitting any NATO tank, including the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams. However, as the Cold War ended and general interest for SPAAG vehicles began declining in favour of more modern missile systems, the OTOMATIC project never received any interest from potential users. For the Italian army, the project was initially accepted, but later abandoned due to budget cuts.
