== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Danger Zone"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VIII, "Field Testing"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The Object 248 inherits the hull and turret of the [[IS-2 (Family)|IS]]-1/2. At this battle rating, this level of protection is overall very lacklustre, although the all-round armour is very effective against SPAA and low tier vehicles (e.g. [[M42 Duster|M42]], [[Crusader AA Mk II|Crusader AA]]). The hull is the same as early IS-1/2 models instead of the 1944 model, meaning the 120 mm thick upper front plate (driver's port) will easily be penetrated by almost any tank (e.g. [[Panther G]], [[Jagdpanther]], [[M26 (Family)|M26]], etc.). Same applies for the large, poorly angled 100 mm lower plate. The only places that can resist some shots are the upper glacis and the rounded "shoulders" which are all very well angled. Note that the curved "shoulders" will become unangled when angling the hull, creating another weak spot, so the player must balance the angling very well. The side thickness of the hull ranges from 100-90 mm, which is thick enough for some angling tactics against kinetic shells. Even when not angling, hits on the hull side might get absorbed by the track or the gap between the hull's upper edge and the turret's lower edge. However HEAT shells (e.g. [[Type 60 SPRG (C)|Type 60]], [[M41 (Family)|M41]]) will still easily penetrate the Object 248. The rear hull's 60 mm thickness and angling is not enough for it to resist any common guns, however the engine behind it can absorb most if not all penetrations.

The turret is also poorly armoured. It has an all-round thickness of 100 mm which may help to bounce some shots with luck. The frontal turret is covered by a large curved gun mantlet which might absorb some shells if they come in contact with the barrel, but that's about it. Well-aimed shots will easily go through the flat parts of the frontal turret or the tall commander's cupola.

The post-penetration survivability is also unsatisfactory, given the cramped design style of Soviet tanks. Frontal penetrations of AP shells through the lower front plate, driver's port, or the turret will usually be a guaranteed death as the closely packed crew of 4 are easily affected by explosion or shrapnel. Penetrations from HEAT are usually not as deadly though can still do critical damage. Side penetrations can very much result the same. Rear penetrations on the hull, as mentioned above, are likely to get blocked by the engine, thus a tactic is to drive the tank backwards and use the engine and radiators as extra armour, at the cost of constantly getting set aflame.

'''Armour type:'''

- Cast homogeneous armour (Front and rear hull, Turret, Gun mantlet, Cupola)
- Rolled homogeneous armour (hull sides and roof, Turret roof, Hatches)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=671|rbMinHp=460}}

The mobility of the Object 248 is satisfactory for a heavy tank. The forward speed on average is about ~35 km/h on paved flat road, and ~20 km/h cross-country, which allows it to keep up with similar teammates like [[IS-2]] and [[Tiger H1]]. The acceleration on all terrains is not exactly agile as a result of the rather underpowered 520 hp engine driving a 46 ton body (the power-to-weight ratio is just over 11 hp/t - quite low). The hull traverse is very slow, and becomes more sluggish when driving on loose surfaces like mud or snow, so a short forward/backward motion is needed to turn the hull faster. The reverse speed of -14 km/h is a great advantage, as it enables the Object 248 to quickly go back to cover if needed, as well as to use the backward-driving tactic above.

Keep your situational awareness high, since the Object 248's poor agility does not let you respond to more agile flankers (e.g. [[M18 Hellcat (Family)|M18]], [[T-34-85 Gai|T-34-85]], [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther]]) quickly.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

{{main|S-34 (100 mm)}}

IS-2 players would become best friends with the Object 248's main gun very fast, since it gets rid of the long reload while keeping the excellent one-shot capability. This 100 mm S-34 cannon has a quick reload time of around 10 seconds which is generally fast enough for most situations. The reduced calibre also increases the ammunition capacity to 31 rounds at most, allowing the player to significantly lengthen their battle time without resupplying ammo. The BR-412B APHEBC shell is extremely powerful, with ~210 mm penetration at around 400 m, and 184 mm at 1,000 m. This level of penetration is adequate to frontally crack even the hardest nuts at its battle rating, such as [[Ferdinand]], [[Jagdpanther]], [[Ho-Ri Production|Ho-Ri]], [[M26 (Family)|M26]], etc. More commonly seen and less armoured tanks like [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panthers]], [[M4 Sherman (Family)|M4 Shermans]], [[Centurion (Family)|Centurions]], etc., are of course even easier to deal with. Upon penetration, the shell's 100 g explosive filler will effortlessly knock out most if not all crew inside the target tank. However, one slight downside of it is the reduced explosive mass comparing to the 122 mm BR-471B's 246 g of explosives, meaning when shooting spacious vehicles like Jagdtiger, you should attempt to target the centre mass of the crew so the shell explodes as closely to their middle as possible, to guarantee a one-shot kill. The shell also has a slightly higher velocity and flatter trajectory, making it easier to land shots at distant and/or moving targets.

The main gun aside, other aspects of the Object 248 don't quite complement the firepower, rather they are drawbacks. Firstly, the familiar awful gun depression of -3° which completely hinders the Object 248's capacity to fight on uneven surfaces. Even a small bulge on the ground would obstruct the gun from aiming down, so the player is left with fewer spots in all maps to unleash their firepower. The turret rotates quite slowly too, at around 10°/s, which is inadequate to quickly change a target. This can be fatal when the Object 248 is being flanked. Lastly, the poor gunsight zoom of 3.5x at max limits the tank from ranged engagements, as it is hard to see a target with low zoom.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Object 248 is armed with a 100 mm S-34 cannon which offers the ability to compete against higher BR vehicles than the IS-2 series, thanks to the higher penetration and faster reload speed the gun offers the tank can perform very well when played smart and careful.

The Object 248 should be treated as a medium tank as it has relatively little armour for a heavy tank for its BR. Play it as a medium tank (T-34 and T-44) and refrain from engaging head-on with enemies, instead flank the enemy from the sides or attack from cover. The tank is perfectly capable of this and can be very lethal when used in this way. But play carefully as a single hit could be enough to take you down due to poor armour.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Rounded frontal hull and turret can sometimes bounce shells
- All-round protection, very useful against SPAA like [[Ostwind II]]
- Relatively low and small for a heavy tank
- Fast reverse speed of -16 km/h allows it to pull back into safety quickly
- The 100 mm cannon has lethal penetration & damage: it can frontally penetrate & knock out hard targets like [[M4A3E2]], [[Jagdpanther]], [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]], etc.
- The 100 mm cannon has a rapid reload (~10 seconds), boosting its firepower exponentially
- Adequate acceleration & speed on paved road, can keep up with some medium tanks (e.g. [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther]]) to provide much-needed heavy fire

'''Cons:'''

- Weak frontal armour: lower front plate and gun mantlet can be easily penetrated by common foes like [[M4A3 (76) W|M4A3 (76)]], [[Chi-Ri II|Chi-Ri]], [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]], etc.
- Closely sat crew of 4 are very likely to be taken out with a single shot
- Sluggish acceleration in loose muddy terrain, heavily reducing mobility
- Poor gun depression (-3°), limiting its capacity in mountaineous terrains
- Turret rotation of ~10°/s is quite slow, can be fatal when reacting to flankers like [[M18 Hellcat (Family)|M18]] and [[M41 Walker Bulldog (Family)|M41]]
