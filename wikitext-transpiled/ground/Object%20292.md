== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the among one of the most ambitious attempts during the final days of the Soviet Union to create a next-generation tank cannon testbed. The Kirov Plant and Mobile Vehicle Engineering Institute planned to introduce a high-calibre smoothbore cannon to enable Soviet MBTs to be able to disable equivalent NATO MBTs at the longest possible distance. This meant choosing a calibre of 152 mm instead of the conventional 125 mm or slightly larger 130 mm, which were still common calibres in Warsaw-Pact countries, and mounting it onto a hybrid between the T-80BV and T-80U's turret. Due to a severe lack of funding as the Soviet Union was struggling with financial debt, although the cannon proved effective during field tests, the prototype was eventually shelved. However, experiences learned during the program would be further iterated on for future MBT prototypes.

The Object 292 was introduced during [[Update "Air Superiority"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8709-event-call-of-the-dragon-earn-the-object-292-en|2024 Call of the Dragon event]]. While it may look like a T-80U without the ERA packages, the lack of an anti-aircraft machine gun and the significantly larger cannon gives it away quite easily. It's not the best protected tank at its tier, but the sheer penetration and damage from the monstrous 152 mm cannon more than makes up for any potential shortcomings by sending the source of the damage back to the hangar in a single shot; however, make sure to make every shot count, as a missed/ineffective shot will most likely be the death sentence of the Object 292.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

If players do not recognize the design of Object 292, its engine sound will surely give its lineage away; the chassis is a T-80BV without the Kontakt-1 ERA blocks, while the turret is from the T-80U without its Kontakt-5 ERA blocks. It could be said that the Object 292's hull is somewhat like a T-80U with the T-80BV's composite armour layout (T-80U has a revised composite armour layout based on the T-80BV's), but the lack of Kontakt-5 also means its upper plate only has the base armour thickness at around 550 mm KE. The common Soviet weakspots still apply, in the form of the lower front plate and driver's port.

The turret is a different story, however. As it uses a revised T-80U turret, it has better protection than the T-80B series thanks to the new composite armour layout giving it a high degree of protection. A good example of this was the redesigning of the mantlet, which was reduced in size compared to its T-80 brethren.  The area around the gun itself can reach up to 500 mm KE protection, making it much harder for lower-tier tanks to penetrate the turret directly, but some parts may still be vulnerable to accurate enemy fire. Commanders should be careful to avoid letting lucky shots hit the mantlet around the barrel, as this can also lead to the turret crew or entire turret system being knocked out of action. The shields on the sides of the turret are effective at stopping chemical rounds, although kinetic protection is expectedly not very substantial.

The turret has a number of weaknesses. Anything above the turret shields is vulnerable to direct APFSDS hits (causing the dart to hit at least one crew member and possibly the turret ammo rack) and HESH, with random parts of the roof causing the entire tank to implode when hit by any amount of overpressure damage. The bottom of the gun mantlet right under the gun has 0 to 1 mm RHA protection, causing the tank to implode when hit by explosives.

The overall internal layout is very similar to most Warsaw-Pact/Chinese MBTs, with a carousel autoloader located at the center mass of the vehicle. However, instead of having the projectiles lying below the propellant like the 6eTS series autoloader on T-64/80 series, the autoloader only consists of the projectiles, while the propellants are located either behind the turret (separated from the crew), or behind the carousel if it cannot fit into the autoloader.

The fuel tanks unfortunately negate all the effort to move critical modules into less vulnerable positions, as they explode hard enough to destroy the tank like any other Soviet MBT, so letting enemies hit the hull, particularly the LFP, is still a bad idea. The three-man crew is also retained with identical layout to the T-80 series - thus any penetrating shots up front that don't detonate the fuel will very likely knock out the driver and cause fatal damage to the turret crew by both the projectile and shrapnel. To make matters worse, if players decide to bring a full load of ammo at 30 rounds, there will be 14 spare propellant charges located exactly behind the autoloader carousel in the chassis. It is never a good idea to turn the Object 292 into a gas-turbine-driven mobile firework launcher, so either the tank needs to dig some cover for its LFP with the dozer blade or try to find at least some kind of solid cover for its hull.

As a last note, the tank doesn't have smoke grenades, only ESS. ESS allows to break automatic trackers of helicopters, but it will not prevent thermal gunner scopes from seeing the tank, and every tank and most aircraft at its rank have one, so it won't really help. It can make things worse, even, as Object 292 doesn't even have thermal scope itself. The tank itself isn't shining extremely bright in thermal sights, at least from the front, but if it will be blinded by its own smoke it will be an easy target for anything.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

To boost the tank with its larger gun, the engine is upgraded from the original Klimov GTD-1000 to the GTD-1250 used on T-80U series; thus it will have enhanced mobility than a conventional T-80BV while players still have to be careful not to over-extend since the relative-slow reverse speed for Soviet tanks still haunts Object 292. The speed is not terrible, but some NATO medium tanks will be faster to positions due to the same or better acceleration.

{{main|LP-83 (152 mm)}}

To engage and destroy NATO MBTs from the longest possible distance with a single shot, Soviet engineers came up with their ultimate solution: instead for opting missiles or 125 mm gun with longer barrel, they opted to increase the calibre to 152.4 mm to create the largest existing smoothbore cannon both in-game and reality.

Although the installation of such a huge cannon into T-80U's turret is not a major problem and it could retain identical, relatively slow turret traverse speed for Soviet-era MBTs, the tank also replaced the 6eTS series autoloader into an unique design specifically for this very cannon, thus the reload rate is drastically decreased to 10 seconds per shot. The firepower itself is fearsome indeed, eclipsing even the [[Ariete AMV]], with only very few MBTs being able to survive a shot to their UFP, but missed shots are also likely to be the end of Object 292 as many enemies could fire up to 2 shots during the 10 seconds reload.

As already mentioned, the tank doesn't have thermal sights, so it is required to look for enemies very carefully. While the shells can turn most tanks into scrap with anything suggesting a direct hit, the commander has to own it by being vigilant and avoiding panic shots. Due to the shell velocity, aiming shots by hand is easy even at extreme distances, but the tank has laser rangefinder anyway, just in case.

==== Ammunition ====
{{:LP-83 (152 mm)/Ammunition|152 mm APFSDS, 152 mm HE}}

The shells of the tank are extremely lethal and give the best in the world of kinetic and chemical shells, respectively.

The APFSDS has shell velocity of 1980 m/s and penetration of 401 mm at 60 degrees. Since the shell weights 7 kg, even a glancing penetration is going to take a life or utterly obliterate some module, whether its by dart itself or the shrapnel it creates. Any hit aimed vaguely in the direction of enemy ammo rack will destroy the target with practically no chance of survival. It's even worse than being hit by heaviest tandem ATGM, as other tanks (including already dead ones) and modules can't stop the penetrator, leaving literally no chance of survival and sometimes resulting in collateral hits.

The HE isn't as overwhelmingly powerful and doesn't have special features like the proximity fuse, but it nonetheless flies at 920 m/s and does same overpressure damage as heaviest artillery tanks. It could even penetrate and destroy Challenger 2 series through the driver port, something other tanks can't even dream of doing, so HE can be fired at the turret neck of virtually any tank and in 90% of the cases have the target destroyed, and in the other 10% cases have enemy gun barrel completely ruined.

'''Notes''':

* The {{PAGENAME}} uses two-piece ammunition, composed of propellant bags (orange) and projectiles (yellow).
* Projectiles and propellant bags are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* The autoloader contains 16 shells. Once these have all been fired, the autoloader must be replenished before being able to fire again.
* Blowout rack only: 17 (+13) shells.

When players see the Object 292 from afar, some might take it as a very odd modification of T-64A due to the turret design, while some might take it as a T-80U with all Kontakt-5 ERA packages destroyed; once their vehicle is hit by APFSDS flying at an unprecedented 1,980 m/s or bombarded by a huge "howitzer" shell, they will soon know what really hit them.

The most iconic feature of the Object 292 is the 152 mm LP-83 smoothbore cannon onboard; holding the record of the largest calibre smoothbore cannons ever completed for more than 3 decades, its ace is its fearsome penetration for both APFSDS and HE-FS shells. Having the highest penetration of all smoothbore cannons, the Object 292 is able to easily penetrate most vehicles it faces through even their most well-protected areas such as UFPs. Even if the shell didn't detonate enemy targets, the sheer penetration ensures critical damage to powerplant and crews, sometimes even completely disabling the turret system of enemy targets.

While using HE-FS is common for Warsaw-Pact/PLAGF MBTs, the Object 292 brings it to a new level - not only does it have devastating explosive content for its shell, it also has very high penetration for HE-FS at a whopping 61 mm, which also turns it into a makeshift APHE since most NATO and PLAGF tanks don't have good side armour to stop side shots, making it more reliable than APFSDS at close distance and still devastating as a makeshift howitzer to engage covered targets.

The 152 mm gun is more than enough to deter enemies from engaging Object 292 without careful consideration, which also makes it a good role to defend key breakthrough points as stationary support vehicle. However, as a prototype tank based on Soviet-era technology, the T-80BV hull and T-80U-equivalent turret also brings some flaws to the 292. First of all, the iconic Kontakt-5 or Kontakt-1 ERA packages are not present on the vehicle, although bolt mounts for them are present on the UFP. The T-80BV series served as the basis of the future T-80U series with revised composite armour formula for better protection, but this only stops APFSDS up to 500 mm penetration; while tanks at its tier might not have the chance to reliably disable Object 292, rushing into the battlefield against higher tier MBTs may not be the best idea.

The turret traverse speed isn't hindered by the weight of the gun itself and retains identical speed as its Soviet-era cousins which is at least 30% slower than NATO/PLAGF counterparts; it is always a good idea to turn the turret beforehand for as much reaction time as possible.

As for the autoloader system - while the tank can ensure consistent 10-second reload, separated propellant from carousel and has turret blowout panels for the propellents, the long reload time also means any missed or non-critical damage to enemy tanks without disabling the gun system gives the death sentence to Object 292, since most tanks at this tier can reload faster than the autoloader even with injured/disabled crew (in case the enemy has ready shell in breech), let alone tanks with autoloader; do remember there's 14 spare propellents for the other 14 shells inside the autoloader in case players decide to bring full-load, once they are hit by enemy shots, players can expect for a huge firework from the detonation of propellents and thus, 16 shells are more than enough to bring down enemy team.

Overall, while Object 292 brings unique experience to players with its devastating firepower and identical handling of Soviet MBTs to get used to easily, players also need situational awareness and not over-extent to deliver the fatal blow every time it fires - a surviving, gas-turbine-driven 152 mm cannon has both the physical and psychological power to deter enemy targets.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 152mm main gun enables this tank to engage targets from long distances and the damage is nearly impossible to survive in case of a critical hit
* Autoloader configuration and blow out panel help with survivability (beware that the blow out panel is only for the first-stage charge storage)
* Upgraded mobility from T-80BV series with GTD-1250 gas-turbine engine
* High explosive content HE-FS for long-range engagement against covered targets

'''Cons:'''

* Weakspots such as LFP and unreliable fuel tank still haunts the protection of hull
** Lacks any ERA for extra protection and having driver's visor exposed to incoming attacks
* No smoke grenades, so losing attention of aircraft is difficult
* No thermal sight while everyone at the rank has one, ESS is not very useful at this point as a consequence as well
* Only three crew members
* Longest reload time for autoloader MBTs at 10 seconds per consecutive shot
* Lacks both coaxial and HMG for gunning down light targets/aircrafts
