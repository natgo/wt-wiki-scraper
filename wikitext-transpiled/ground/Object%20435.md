== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Object 435 has a rather strange appearance like many other Soviet "Object" prototypes. The hull front has unusual angles that wouldn't seem out of place on the IS heavy tank family, but it has a very round turret reminiscent of the [[T-62]]. The suspension and roadwheels foreshadow the [[T-64A (1971)|T-64]]. It was designed as a next-generation medium tank to potentially replace the ubiquitous T-54/55 under the name "Object 430" with new 100 mm or 115 mm U-5TS (2A20) smoothbore gun for the Object 435, but ultimately was shelved for what eventually became the T-64 (Object 432) and now stored in Kubinka Tank Museum right next to the tank that won the state certification, T-64A (Object 434).

Introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]], the Object 435 offers a similar experience to the T-62 while being placed in the T-64/T-80 MBT line in the tech tree. It has the same powerful 115 mm smoothbore cannon with good APFSDS rounds that can tackle most foes without any issues at the cost of a slow reload. Mobility and turret traverse are slightly improved. It trades the ESS system for an optical rangefinder. A nice bonus is that while the T-62 lacks any kind of pintle machine gun, not even a humble 12.7 mm DShK, the Object 435 packs a KPVT 14.5 mm heavy machine gun that can shred light vehicles and helicopters. Players transitioning from the [[T-10M]] will be very happy to still have an effective supplement to the main cannon.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
For previous players who own T-64 series, they can tell Object 435 should have some kind of resemblance to the infamous "Kharkov (Kharkiv) Fortress" tanks from the flat, dish-like road wheels and narrow side skirts; this is indeed true as the Object 43x were the numbers used by the T-64 family and their competitors or prototypes. The Object 435 still used the irregular and angular UFP design from the Object 430 (while 432 was the T-64 itself, the LRIP variants with 115 mm gun), players will see 3 triangular plates on the UFP at 120 mm (front plate) and 40 mm (side plates) respectively; aside from that, the tank looks like an irregular T-62 from afar. The protection might look similar to previous [[T-54 (1947)]] with a 120 mm UFP at 60°, some might even start to consider it will be easy for APDS or late full-caliber shell to penetrate the UFP; this might be true to tanks like [[M103]] or [[Conqueror]] with high-penetration shells at their tier, but once the other tanks do so, they will most likely find their attempt fruitless as the UFP can provide up to 360 mm RHA equivalent even without composite armor. To say at least, for ensured penetrations, enemies will have to bring in vehicles with HEAT or APFSDS to penetrate the UFP. In most cases tanks below its tier could only rely on HEAT warhead to defeat the armor; but in some cases, the joints between the triangular plates can be vulnerable to full-caliber APCBC shots and hit the fuel tank/ammo storages, causing an explosion or even "Jack-in-the-Box" type detonation; sometimes the area around the mantle provides inconsistent protection where penetrated APCBC can damage the gun or even knock-out the crews in extreme cases.

The sides and rear are similar to previous Soviet medium tanks at 80 mm/40 mm (vs 80 mm/45 mm), while the sides has side skirts and tool boxes to stop oncoming shots from autocannons, the hull itself doesn't; if shots penetrated the sides, due to the cramped interior of the tank, either the crews will suffer fatal damages or ammunitions scattered around the center-mass will detonate. So do not show the sides to the enemies for the maximum survivability to Object 435.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=899|rbMinHp=513}}

The mobility of the Object 435 is slightly improved over the T-62, with a slightly higher power-to-weight ratio thanks to the new Kharkov 5TD engine at 580 hp output. The reverse speed has also been improved by a small amount. Unfortunately it still lacks behind speedy MBTs like the Leopard or AMX-30, so it is not great for flanking or rushing vantage points.

{{main|U-5TS (115 mm)}}

The 115 mm U-5TS smoothbore cannon is the same as on the T-62. It reloads more quickly than the T-10M's 122 mm rifled gun, but lags far behind NATO guns. It is very important to make every shot count. The Object 435 does enjoy a better turret rotation speed than the T-62, matching the [[T-64A (1971)]], which is helpful for brawling. One degree of gun depression is lost compared to the T-62.

==== Ammunition ====
The Object 435's ammunition needs no introduction to T-62 veterans. The stock 3BM4 round is a solid steel dart with a high muzzle velocity and good angled penetration. It has poor flat penetration, especially compared to the T-10M's heavy 3BM-11 APDS, but practically any tank can be dispatched with a shot to the hull. Even after the other ammunition types are unlocked, 3BM4 should be a staple in the Object 435's arsenal.

The 3BM3 tungsten-cored APFSDS has much greater flat penetration, but its angled penetration at 60° is degraded significantly. Since the Object 435 will meet very few enemy tanks that 3BM3 would perform better against than 3BM4, it should be mostly disregarded.

The 3BK4 HEAT-FS round is quite impressive within its class, with good penetration and TNT equivalent. It has less consistent damage than APFSDS and can be defeated by ERA, so it should be reserved for either overpressuring light targets or attacking huge steel behemoths like the [[Maus]] or [[Object 279]] that can sometimes block APFSDS.

The 3OF11 is an ordinary HE shell containing 2.64 kg of TNT. While it's enough to overpressure light vehicles, it's a far cry from the infamous 125 mm 3OF26 rounds of later Soviet MBTs and will have a difficult time damaging anything with decent protection, but is still much better than most HE shells similarly rated MBTs have to offer. The Object 435's slow reload also makes it very dangerous if an well-armoured target shows up when a HE shell is loaded. It helps to bring several rounds for smacking light tanks or exposed cupolas opportunistically, but it should not be relied on as a primary tool.

Notes:

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 5 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 8 shells and gets filled up first when loading up the tank.
** This rack is also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is: 5 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-4 into rack 5. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

The Object 435 has a pintle-mounted KPVT heavy machine gun on the loader's cupola and a coaxial SGMT general-purpose machine gun. The SGMT isn't worth writing home about but the high-calibre KPVT definitely is. With a mixed belt of API-T, cermet core, and IAI rounds, it can shred many light targets from at least the sides and is very good at setting helicopters and planes ablaze. The 50 round belt capacity is low, but it's enough to provide a good volume of fire while the tank's main cannon is reloading.

Keep in mind that since the KPVT is not a coaxial weapon, it is unavailable if the loader is knocked out. So the T-10M is still better as a KPVT carrier, having both coaxial and pintle mounts.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Object 435 looks and acts like a cross between the T-62 and T-64. Most of its characteristics are similar to the T-62, so it is worth examining which aspects are different.

The Object's offensive power is generally superior. The improvements to mobility and turret traverse make it a more effective brawler in urban combat and the KPVT machine gun is a helpful supplemental weapon; while a T-62 would need to hide and retreat if a light target survived a hit from the main gun, the Object can spray them down with 14.5 mm rounds and finish the job. Armoured targets can still be stripped of their tracks and barrels. At long distances, the new optical rangefinder is helpful for landing precise hits, even if it is not as effective as a laser rangefinder.

The main weakness of the Object 435 is that it has no sources of smoke, with no grenades, ESS, or smoke shells. This makes it difficult to escape from a bad situation or cover a retreat, so careful positioning is very important. Another flaw is its fixed-zoom, narrow FOV optics with 8.0x zoom. While this is fine at long distances, the lack of a low-zoom, wide FOV option can be an issue in close combat for players used to the T-55/T-62 family.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Same powerful gun as T-62 with improved gun handling

* Fairly low profile
* Powerful KPVT heavy machine gun
* Optical rangefinder for long-distance shots

'''Cons:'''

* No protection against HEAT or APFSDS rounds
* No sources of smoke
* Slow reload
* Loud and recognizable engine 

== History ==

The prototype Object 435 medium tank was the most advanced in a series of experimental tanks being developed by Kharkov plant No. 75 under the "new medium tank" program at the very beginning of the 1960s. The Object 435 became a test vehicle for the newly developed 115mm U-5TS Molot unitary-loading smoothbore cannon that was later installed on tanks of the T-62 family. The tank had a short hull and an original hull armor layout at the front, which was supposed to provide the vehicle with a high level of protection against kinetic munitions. The Object 435 was canceled in 1961 in favor of another prototype, Object 432. A survivor Object 435 tank is on display at Patriot park near Moscow.
