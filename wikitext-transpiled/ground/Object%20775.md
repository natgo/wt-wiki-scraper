In the mid 1960s, the USSR devised a new idea for a frontline tank destroyer: a low-profile armoured tank with a gun-launcher. By utilizing multiple technologies of the time, namely hydropneumatic suspension, a drum autoloader, and a shortened gun-launcher, the profile of the vehicle could be lowered to a new extreme. The first prototype of this project, the "Object 775" was a more obscure but intriguing piece of military history. With its unique design and the ability to fire anti-tank guided missiles from a concealed, low-profile turret, the Object 775 aimed to be a formidable addition to the Soviet military's arsenal. However, the program faced various challenges, including technical issues with the drum autoloader and hydropneumatic suspension cramped in such a small vehicle, and changing military requirements and Soviet tank doctrine of the era. These hurdles ultimately led to the cancellation of the program to instead focus on the development of a new dedicated MBT armed with an autoloaded 115 mm gun firing APFSDS rounds, resulting in the [[Object 435]] prototype for the future [[T-64 (Family)|T-64]]. The Object 775's story is a reminder of the ever-evolving nature of military technology and the need for constant adaptation to meet the demands of modern warfare.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''', introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]], is definitely unique in its appearance. The Object 775 excels in hidden strikes at most ranges due to its strong [[Anti-tank guided missiles|ATGM]], comically low profile, and decent frontal armour for its battle rating. When utilizing the hydropneumatic suspension and the built-in dozer blade to entrench the tank, the Object 775 can achieve almost complete invisibility from the enemy line of sight in its own "dug-in" cover, using its suspension to "peek" up and take a shot before lowering back down. The Object 775, however, most not be played as a brawler, as its side armour and internal protection is very weak. Due having a large ammo rack around the inside of the tank and only two crew members in the turret, pretty much any penetrating or overpressuring shot is guaranteed to destroy the tank. All in all, the Object 775 builds on the doctrine of Soviet missile tank destroyer engagement, primarily from the preceding [[IT-1]].

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The mobility is solidly average. The Object 775 is very similar to the T-62, with a long and narrow chassis coupled to a decent engine. The vehicle will never be first to the fight or to cap points but it is fast enough to fit its playstyle very comfortably.

The vehicle has acceptable terrain-crossing capability but doesn't have the best torque for going up bigger hills or for keeping speed up on bumpy terrain.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|D-126 (125 mm)}}

The 775 is armed with the [[D-126 (125 mm)|125mm D-126]] gun-launcher system. This weapon will be very familiar to tankers who have played the M551 Sheridan before, as the primary ammunition is an ATGM and an HE round. The barrel is very short, helping maintain the stealth of the vehicle. The turret traverse is not very fast so care will need to be taken to pre-aim the gun around any expected enemy avenues of approach.

The Rubin ATGM is a very solid missile, providing users 500mm of penetration while having great speed (550 m/s) and decent range (2.49 miles). The only downside is that right after leaving the barrel, the missile dips down before coming back into the center of the sight, making firing from behind cover difficult.

The BUR High-Explosive rocket is less functional but can be fun to surprise enemies with. The round drops very quickly and there is no laser rangefinder, making anything but point-blank shots an exercise in skill. The warhead contains the equivalent of 3.96kg of TNT, making it a serious threat to lightly armored targets.

Given how condensed the ammunition is, you can comfortably take a full loadout. The main ammo storage is in the front of the tank, protected by heavily sloped armor and internal fuel tanks. The central autoloader holds eight rounds, allowing you to fire a new projectile every . The autoloader also gets replenished extremely fast so running out of ammo in the carousel is not life-threatening, unlike many other ATGM vehicles.

{{main|PKT (7.62 mm)}}

The only machine gun the 775 has available is a coaxial 7.62mm PKT. This weapon is next to useless as open-top vehicles are exceedingly rare and it doesn't have the targeting speed or power to hurt any air vehicles.

'''Gameplay Summary'''

Object 775 plays very similarly to the [[IT-1]], another rocket only tank in the Soviet Tech tree. However, unlike IT-1, the 775 can also engage somewhat effectively in the CQC if needed. Like most ATGM tank destroyers, being only equipped with the Rubin anti-tank missile can put the 775 at a disadvantage in many situations when facing conventional enemies armed with a cannon, but it does have the capacity to excel in certain situations, like setting ambushes.

'''Close Range Engagement'''

Unlike [[IT-1]], 775 has some chance in CQC due to its very low profile and the adjustable suspension can help to "level" the battlefield. However, player should weight their options, because once committed to the attack, backing out is difficult due to the signature Soviet horrendous reverse speed.

Needless to say, some attention must be paid to your team status as well, as sometimes an enemy might get very bold if all allies surrounding you have died, and since you only have one launcher, fear is all you have to protect the 775 from a large tank squad.

'''Mid to Long Range Engagement'''

The mid to long range is the optimal engagement range for many ATGM tank destroyers and 775 is no exception. However, player must use terrain a bit differently, as unlike IT-1, the 775 doesn't have a top mounted launcher to shoot over the hills but a 125 mm D-126 rifled missile launcher.

=== Devblog History ===
In the early 1960s, the USSR began to develop a promising medium tank with guided missile weapons. Engineers from the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant presented two prototypes for testing of the Object 775 tank, featuring Rubin anti-tank guided missiles, which are launched from the barrel of the tank. In 1968, the project was closed due to the concentration of efforts on the Object 434 tank project (which became the T-64A). The only surviving Object 775 is on display at the Patriot Park in Kubinka near Moscow.
