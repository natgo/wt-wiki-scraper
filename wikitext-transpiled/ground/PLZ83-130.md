== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}'''was an export solution of PLZ83 SPH once spotted on 1987's NORINCO export catalogue. Likely before the introduction of Gerald Bull's 155 mm GC-45 in Mainland China production, to further extend the firing range from [[PL66 Gai (152 mm)|PL66-152]], NORINCO adopted the earlier but with much longer firing range PL59A-130 while retaining most equipment from PLZ83; this attempt was eventually abandoned after NORINCO already developed the more advanced PLZ45 series. 

Introduced during [[Update "Alpha Strike"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8861-development-inferno-cannon-plz83-130-en|2024 "Inferno Cannon" event]], aside from the Pinocchio-like 130 mm PL59 replaced the original 152 mm howitzer, most features are identical to its cousin PLZ83, this time with one of the most powerful APHE, PLAGF 130 mm shell with different fuse (i.e VT) as well as smoke shells, this gives much more flexibility than its cousin while players should be extra careful on their waypoints and be prepared for any incoming hostiles, the 130 mm shell would still deter enemies with its fearsome penetration.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
PLZ83-130 retained identical layout and overall design from its base model, PLZ83 with a 4-men turret, only the main cannon changed into a 130 mm howitzer; this also means most features, namely the protection is totally identical between each other. The design of PLZ83-130 is somewhat similar to a later vehicle both in tech tree and reality which also shares the same WZ321 chassis - PTZ89, while the former uses a rifled howitzer, the latter uses domestic 120 mm smoothbore cannon. In most cases, enemy would have to deploy higher calibre autocannons to handle PLZ83-130 from some distance without using ATGMs or main cannons; while the frontal protection is somewhat sufficient, be extra careful on enemies coming from the flanks as they can gun down the turret crew with ease, sometimes even detonating the 130 mm ammunition at the rear side of turret and inside the hull, leading to a total destruction of the vehicle and its crew.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
As a prototype vehicle modified from a PLZ83, the 130 mm howitzer variant didn't upgrade its mobility; for better logistics and reliable powerplant, it retained the same 12V150L engine from Type 59 while having planetary transmission. It does have sufficient speed to follow the main forces with its 57 km/h speed but do remember never, even try to over-extend; the -7 km/h reverse speed will make players think twice before risking the vehicle.

The original 152 mm howitzer was replaced by a 130 mm PL59A while retaining identical hydraulic recoil absorbers from the PLZ83, as well as the mechanical assisted loader for the howitzer; although sharing identical travel limits and and turret traverse speed, the gun itself has much better muzzle velocity than most howitzers at its tier, tied with NATO 155 mm howitzers with OE F3 shell.

==== Ammunition ====
{{:PL59A Gai (130 mm)/Ammunition|BR-482B, PL59A-130 HE, Type 59 HE-VT, Type 59-1 Smoke}}If the most suitable word for PLZ83 is "inflexible", the -130 variant is the antonym in this case; thanks to the introduction of ammunition for its Soviet cousin, M-46 and changing fuse for different purpose, this enables PL83-130 with much higher flexibility.

'''BR-482B; Stock''' - PLAGF also acquired the schematics for the BR-482B from the introduction of 130 mm M-46 howitzer; thanks to the compatibility to Soviet Army heavy tanks like the infamous IS-7 for its 130 mm S-70 which is also based on naval 130 mm B-13, this turns the PLZ83-130 into a railgun-like howitzer with the second highest penetration for full-calibre kinetic shot just behind the monstrous Object 279 with higher velocity. A penetrated 130 mm shell with 313 mm penetration at point-blank range can certainly demolish even the heaviest targets around its tier.

'''Type 59 HE; Stock''' - The other stock shell for the vehicle, aka 3OF33 in Soviet service; although the calibre hindered the penetration of the shell much less than its 152 mm cousin, it is sill extremely lethal to light vehicles when the BR-482B will certainly over-penetrates the target, it is always a good idea to bring some HE-frag just in case. 

'''Type 59-1 Smoke; Tier I''' - A feature that sets aside the PL59A-130 from other 122 mm or 152 mm guns is the existence of smoke shells; while the vehicle itself lacks smoke grenades or ESS for self concealment, the shell will certainly helps the team by blinding enemy line of sight or laying covering smoke for friendly heading for vantage points.

'''Type 59 HE-VT; Tier III''' - The VT variant of Type 59 HE replaced its fuse with MD81 radio fuse for improvised anti-aircraft and infantry suppression operations (for maximum shrapnel radius), the ballistic performance is totally identical to its HE variant but players might take some time to adapt the shell velocity of this one, do remember to change back to APHE or conventional HE before engaging any ground targets.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Large ammo count of 38 shells, more than the PLZ83
* Sufficient mobility ensured by Type 59 equivalent powerplant
* Relative fast gun vertical traverse
* More flexible ammunition options than PLZ83 with APHE and smoke shells
* Higher gun depression than early Cold-War SPHs
* Rather straight ballistics equivalent to GC-45 155 mm howitzer-equivalents (i.e [[VIDAR]], [[Type 99]] SPH)

'''Cons:'''

* Insufficient explosive mass to handle heavy targets
* Protection only rated up to HMG calibre gun
* Insufficient reverse speed
* Huge profile with high likelihood of detonation once penetrated
* Slow turret traverse speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The information on the development for PLZ83-130 is rather sparse due to its only appearance on NORINCO's 1987 export catalogue; by 1980s, NORINCO and PLAGF seeked for a solution to vastly upgrade the artillery combat capability. Thanks to the exile of Gerald Bull who developed the new 155 mm GC-45 howitzer due to some of his artillery projects, his invention would be eventually introduced into PLAGF service and later manufactured by NORINCO; meanwhile, to further enhance the firing range of PLZ83, NORINCO installed the infamous 130 mm PL59A-130 which has already proved its capabilities in cross-strait artillery wars and Sino-Vietnamese conflicts on the PLZ83 platform. Likely due to the eventual introduction of PLZ45, a very successful artillery product of NORINCO with hundreds of orders from Middle Eastern countries and updated requirements from PLAGF, the export solution was eventually ditched with no orders placed by foreign customers.
