== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Direct Hit"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7350-event-export-order-en|2021 Export Order]] event.

The PT-16/T14 mod. is a Leopard 2 prototype (like the Leopard 2K). It differs from the earlier prototype by its different turret more reminiscent of the production version, no remote-controlled 20 mm cannon, and an extremely fast autoloading cannon.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 2 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 9 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is 2 - 1.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into rack 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Due to its good mobility and fast-firing cannon, this tank is perfectly suited for flanking enemy positions or sniping from afar. With its poor armour protection and large frontal ammo rack, taking this tank into a head-on fight is often very dangerous, but it can be a very dangerous run-and-gun tank if the driver has quick reflexes and good target acquisition. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good mobility
* Good gun handling with laser rangefinder, quick turret traverse, and two-plane stabilizer
* Very short reload time thanks to its autoloader
* Has access to potent shells, like the potent 120 mm DM23 APFSDS round
* Stereoscopic rangefinder gives near-instant range readings and automatically adjusts the sights

'''Cons:'''

* Poor armour protection overall
* Stock HEATFS shell
* No thermal sights
* Small first stage ammo storage of 9 rounds, additional ammo is kept at the front of hull presenting a large weak spot.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

During the development of the Leopard 2 project, German engineers came up with several different hull and turret designs as well as respective combinations. This led to equally many different prototype designs being tested. Among these experimental versions was the Leopard chassis with the PT-14 turret, developed by Krauss-Maffei in the early 1980s. 

The peculiarity of this design was the presence of an autoloading mechanism for the cannon, giving it an extremely high rate of fire. Despite undergoing exhaustive tests in Germany, the autoloader wasn't adopted in the final design of the Leopard 2 and the concept remained just a prototype.
