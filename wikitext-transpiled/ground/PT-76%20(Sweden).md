== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. It is identical to the [[PT-76B]] found in the Russian Tech Tree. 

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Pretty much every tank in the game will be able to destroy the PT-76B with relative ease due to the ultra-thin armour of it. Avoid tanks with access to heavy machine guns on their turrets such as most American tanks, the [[IS-2 (1944)]], etc.

Also, keep well clear of enemy SPAA. 12.7 mm guns and above will absolutely wreck this tank. In particular, the Wirbelwind is a big threat. It has good penetration at range and will literally saturate the vehicle with autocannon shells. Just a short burst from the quad 20 mm guns will finish the PT-76B off.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful HEAT can frontally penetrate even heavily armoured tanks like [[Tiger II (H)]], [[Ho-Ro]], [[Ferdinand]]
* Two-plane gun stabiliser is a huge advantage in sudden encounters and CQC
* Has night vision device, another advantage in night battles
* Is amphibious, allowing it to drive in bodies of water for surprise attacks
* Has a low profile

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely thin armour cannot protect it from any hit, especially SPAA (eg. [[ZSD63/PG87|ZSD63]], [[Wirbelwind]])
* HEAT shell has limited damage, increasing the chance of the target surviving a hit
* APHE has low penetration (100mm max), limiting target selection
* Low mobility for a light tank, other light vehicles (eg. [[M24]], [[Concept 3]], [[M18 (China)|M18]]) all have superior speed
* -7 km/h reverse speed is poor, can put the player in a dangerous situation
* -4° gun depression severely affects its performance among hills
