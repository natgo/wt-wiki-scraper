== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', also known as the PT-76E, is the most modern upgrade for the PT-76 platform. It introduces a more capable 57 mm autocannon, capable of firing the same shells as the [[ZSU-57-2]], night vision devices, and an upgraded two-plane stabilizer. The new BM-57 turret houses the 57 mm AU-220M autocannon. With new armour-piercing shells capable of penetrating modern APCs and IFVs. The gun is also capable of engaging aerial targets in low-level flight from up to 6 kilometres. Mobility has been greatly increased with the addition of a new transmission, a more powerful engine with a power to weight ratio of 20 hp/ton, and new tracks that reduce driver fatigue. Survivability was also increased with modern fast-acting firefighting systems. The modernization also includes modern 1P67 and "Liga-S" optics for better target acquisition. A total of 50 units have been ordered.

Introduced during [[Update "Direct Hit"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season V, "River Hunter"]], the PT-76-57, possesses many significant upgrades, including night vision and a two-plane stabilizer. The main difference is the armament, a rapid-firing AU-220 57 mm cannon fitted in a unique turret which, using the same BR-281 shells as the [[ZSU-57-2]], proves very effective when dealing with numerous enemies at once. Compared to the ZSU-57-2 due to the similar armament, the PT-76-57 makes up having only half the firepower by instead having a significantly faster rate of fire. On a relatively mobile and low-profile chassis, the PT-76-57 can be a true menace on the battlefield when flanking otherwise heavily armoured foes or tearing through lightly armoured IFVs and light tanks. Its gun is capable of destroying targets with its APHE shell even from the front when it faces lower BR opponents. The laser rangefinder makes it very easy to acquire targets at longer distances, and allow the PT-76-57 to be used as a flanker/sniper.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Overall, armour is extremely weak. You cannot rely on the armour to save you in any circumstance, as almost everything in the BR bracket can penetrate you at any angle, and at any range. The turret face averages around 35 mm of armour, the upper and lower glacis averages between 23 mm and 45 mm, and the sides are extremely weak, at only 13 mm of armour. The frontal armour and the angles will only protect you from heavy machine guns. Even light machine guns can penetrate your vehicle from the side, so if you disable an enemy's main gun, be sure to avoid showing your vulnerable sides to enemy machine gun fire.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)

{{main|AU-220 (57 mm)}}

The AU-220 cannon is extremely effective in the BR bracket, as it can destroy any light tank at ranges up to 2.5 km, most medium tanks up to 2 km, and can reliably destroy heavies using weak spot sniping from 1.5 km. In CQB, the cannon is devastating, and the 20 g of TNT filler in the round ensure catastrophic damage from a successful penetration. The cannon performs best in CQB, or at ranges of less than ~1 km. At long range, use your laser rangefinder and pinpoint weak spots, or aim for the vulnerable sides. Some things to consider remain, though, like the relatively low muzzle velocity of the round, the low penetration at ranges beyond 2 km, and the fact that you cannot reliably destroy heavies frontally. Unlike most tanks, it thrives best in an uptier, where you face early MBTs with poor armour. Plus, the cramped crew compartments of these MBTs allow for consistent single-shot knock-outs from the sides.

'''Notes''':

* As they are modeled by sets of 2, shells disappear from the rack only after you've fired both shells in the set.
* Rack 2 is a first stage ammo rack (autoloader magazine). It totals 20 shells.
** This racks gets filled first when loading up the tank and is also emptied first.
** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
** Once the autoloader magazine has been depleted, you can't shoot until the autoloader has been restocked with at least 1 shell. The restocking time is much longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into rack 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
** The depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 1.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The PT-76-57 performs extremely well in the support role, or as a flanker type of vehicle. In smaller maps, try to avoid face-to-face confrontations with heavy tanks, as it will quickly get your vehicle destroyed. Instead, try to secure a good position near a cap point, or flank to a side route to surprise passing tanks. As a support tank, stick with friendly tanks, scouting and helping to repair as needed. Disable tanks for allies to finish when you can't, and destroy more lightly armoured targets. This tank performs exceptionally well as a flanker as well, as it is fairly mobile and can easily take out tanks from the sides. If a more aggressive playstyle suits you better, rush a capture point, find a secure position, and destroy enemies pushing into it.

;Notable enemies

* [[T26E5]], [[T34]], [[T32 Heavy Tank (Family)|T32]] - These American heavies cannot be taken out frontally quickly enough to avoid return fire. Either flank the sides to cook the ammo, or disable and let allies pick them off.
* [[M46]], [[M60 (Family)|M60]] - These American mediums are abundant at this BR, and cannot be reliable penetrated from the front. Disable the main gun and mobility first, then shoot the cupola to incapacitate ~ 2 crew members. If it is safe to push, get a side shot for a crew knock-out or ammo. Make sure not to expose your sides to machine guns.
* [[M48 Patton (Family)|M48]] series - These tanks can be penetrated frontally, or from the side, or the rear of the turret. However, with powerful weaponry and decent armour, they can easily disable your vehicle. Most of them also have rangefinders, so distance is not a sure way to protect yourself.
* [[SPz BMP-1]], [[BMP-1]] - These fast, mobile light tanks can easily take out enemies with the 73 mm anti-tank gun, or their missiles. Luckily, they are easy to take out, as 1-2 rounds will usually either destroy the ammo or knockout the small crew.
* [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]] - This tank is heavily armoured, has a powerful gun, and excellent survivability. Ideally, you only face them from the side, where you can easily penetrate. However, from the front, you need to go in this order: Disable the main gun, then break a track, and then knockout crew by shooting the commanders cupola. This will incapacitate at least 2 turret crew members.
* [[Kugelblitz]] and [[Wiesel 1A4]] - These German AA's can shred you from any angle and most ranges, so beware. However, you can destroy them just as easily, so be aware of your surroundings. The Wiesel is exceptionally dangerous because of its mobility and small size, so it can take key positions and show up behind friendly lines quickly.
* [[Marder A1-]] and [[DF105]] - The Marder has missiles and a rapid fire autocannon - two things that don't match with the PT-76-57 very well. The DF105 has a powerful HEATFS round that will knock you out instantly. Again, powerful light tanks are a major threat and a top priority.
* [[Centurion Mk.5 AVRE]] - This HESH lobbing medium tank is one of your most dangerous enemies, because even a hit NEAR your tank will cause destruction by overpressure. However, the long reload makes it extremely vulnerable for an extended period of time, and a penetrated commander cupola will incapacitate turret crew members. Make sure to disable the barrel first, though, or you will see the hanger screen very quickly.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Rapid-firing 57 mm autocannon can deal huge damage in a short amount of time
* Two-plane stabiliser grants it the ability to fire first, compared to most opponents which lack stabilisers
* 5x-14x gunsight zoom is great for both short range and long range engagements
* Fast -17 km/h reverse allows it to pull out dangerous situations in time
* ~150 mm penetration plus 20 g TNT filler is deadly for side shots
* Has both smoke grenade launchers (2 salvoes) and ESS
* Amphibious
* Laser rangefinder, very uncommon for its BR

'''Cons:'''

* Inherits the PT-76 hull, meaning extremely poor armour and vulnerable to overpressure and strafing aircraft
* Only 3 crew members, meaning a turret hit will take your vehicle out with a single shot
* ~150 mm penetration will struggle against late/cold war heavy tanks like [[M103]], [[Conqueror]], [[Maus]], etc.
* Ammunition carousel layout increases detonation risk in the event of a centre-mass penetration
* Limited -5° gun depression restricts the tank's capacity in mountainous environment
* 20-round ready rack, while replenished quickly, is a weak spot easy to target

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In the early 2000s, the issue of increasing the combat effectiveness of the numerous, but outdated PT-76's was proposed to be solved in a very non-trivial way. Engineers of the Nizhny Novgorod design bureau "Burevestnik" combined the 57 mm automatic gun developed in the USSR at the end of the 70s with a mechanized ammunition rack, combining this in a combat module for a specially created turret for light tanks of the PT-76 series. While considering possible ways to re-equip old amphibious tanks with a new weapon, the small-calibre automatic cannon, although it was inferior to other variants of larger calibres in terms of armour penetration, gained a lot in terms of the burst weight to time ratio, as well as in possible applications - from destroying armoured vehicles (including a modern MBT when hit to the side) to fighting helicopters.

The AU-220 module itself, built on the basis of the Soviet S-60 anti-aircraft gun, has already been proposed for the fleet in the form of a remotely controlled shipborne mounting. For use on armoured vehicles, the module was equipped with a modern fire control system with night vision devices and a laser rangefinder. The prototype PT-76 with a 57 mm gun, remained at a stage as a working prototype, however, the AU-220M module continues to exist as a promising solution for the latest vehicles in the Russian army.
