The '''Panzerkampfwagen V Ausführung F (Panther F)''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29 Sd.Kfz. Index|Sd.Kfz. Index:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 171''') is the fourth production variant of the iconic [[Panther tank (Family)|Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank family]]. In November 1943, Rheinmetall designed a new turret with a narrow front plate 120 mm (4.72 in) thick. From a distance, the narrow turret presented a smaller target for the enemy. In March 1944, the design was revised under the name Schmale Blende Turm-Panther. This was one of several designs that were eventually dubbed "Schmallturm" (narrow turret). The Schmale Blende appears to be a modification that served as one of numerous proposals for the [[Panther II|Panzerkampfwagen V Ausfuehrung II (Panther II)]]. This updated turret design weighed less than the original Panther turret (from 7,665 kg to 7,565 kg) and reduced the area of frontal armour while maintaining interior crew space. It also reduced production time by around 30-40%. Unfortunately, due to the end of World War II, the Panther F did not see serial production, but eight hulls and three turrets were completed in 1945.

Introduced in the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before Update 1.41, the Panther F is one of the redesigned Panthers that would eventually become the Panther II. However, due to the conclusion of World War II and Germany's lack of practically all resources, the Panther F did not see combat. Players can experience this one-of-a-kind Panther with much better turret cheek protection. Trap shot problems have also been resolved as the redesigned turret has no surface for shells to ricochet into the hull. It is also the first Panther tank to include an optical rangefinder, which allows players to measure ranges much faster than before, up to more than 2 kilometres.

From the hull up, the F variation of the Panther is similar to previous models. However, the biggest and most noticeable change is seen in the turret design. Instead of the transverse-cylindrical mantlet of the [[Panther D|D]] and [[Panther A|A]] models or the chinned mantlet of the [[Panther G|G]] model, the Panther F features a brand new trapezoidal turret named the ''Schmalturm'' (or "Narrow Turret"). This new turret features a bevy of positives over its previous iterations, including beefier armour and the removal of the prominent shot trap caused by the cylindrical nature of the previous model's mantlet. Although this new turret is a welcome addition, it is not without its weaknesses. The Panther will occasionally be facing enemies that can and will penetrate its turret from the front, namely the [[M26]], [[T26E1-1]], [[Tiger II (P)|Tiger II]], [[IS-2 (1944)|IS-2]], [[Tortoise]], [[AMX M4]].

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=930|rbMinHp=531}}

As expected of the Panther series, it features excellent mobility as a result of its very high power to weight ratio. However its mobility has been toned down a few notches due to the limiting of the engine to improve engine lifespan, which is unfortunately useless as reliability has no function in War Thunder. It is also important to note that the reverse has not improved from its lethargic 3 km/h, but the Panther's ability to neutral turn helps tremendously when trying to escape.

{{main|KwK44 (75 mm)}}

The KwK44 is an incredibly effective gun when engaging enemy armour due to its penetration. Although not as effective as the later legendary [[KwK43 (88 mm)|KwK43]], it's enough to penetrate most enemies it will face, resulting in many two-shot kills with the help of the PzGr 39's explosive filler. The penetration combined with the excellent accuracy makes it an ideal sniping cannon.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Panther is a great "hunter," locating weak (slow, damaged, or alone) tanks and taking them out is by far its greatest capability. Mobility is a big advantage and the tanker should use it to their advantage, especially when fighting higher-rank vehicles. You should find a suitable location as soon as possible; when you do this, you can easily push off advancing enemy tanks while heavier allies join the action. Just when you notice that you have strong opposition it is time to retreat. Your role is not to fight directly but rather spot weaknesses in the enemy defence. Once you learn how to take advantage of its speed and gun, you'll easily take out enemy targets by surprise.

Despite its slower turret traverse speed and mobility over the Panther A, it receives better turret armour, a rangefinder and faster reload.

Most of the heavy tanks that the Panther faces are not fast enough to counter its attacks. However, this does not mean that they are harmless. Be careful when approaching the enemy and always try to have the advantage. It is not advised to attack enemy heavy tanks directly or frontally; this is where they have most of their armour, and the Panther will probably not be able to penetrate it. It is better to retreat and try to find an alternative route before engaging the enemy.

The Panther has no anti-air capabilities, so it is best to find cover if there are enemy aircraft nearby that are equipped with bombs or rockets.

If the map allows it and you prefer this kind of playstyle, the Panther F also excels at sniping. Although having a slower turret traverse speed and mobility compared to the Panther A, the F version trades it for better turret armour, a rangefinder and faster reload. The distance will make your armour almost impenetrable to a lot of guns while being able to use the rangefinder, high muzzle velocity and great optics to pick off enemies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Flat mantlet removes the shot trap which plagued earlier models
* Nigh impenetrable turret cheeks when facing from the front
* 75 mm KwK44 is an accurate and powerful gun
* Explosive filler on PzGr 39 shell allows for easy one- or two-shot kills
* APCR shell can allow the tank to compete with the heavier armour found in an uptier
* Features excellent, although toned down mobility as well as neutral steering
* Hull can become even more difficult to penetrate when angled properly
* Slightly faster reload than the previous models of Panthers
* Optical rangefinder, allows you to measure the range faster than the normal rangefinder and up to 2,200-2,500 m (depending on your crew qualification)

'''Cons:'''

* Although the turret has increased armour, it remains a weak spot with basically no angling
* Hull suffers similarly to turret; although good by itself, it becomes paper when facing higher tier guns
* 75 mm KwK44 can become difficult to use as a sniper in an uptier
* Pitiful reverse speed
* Slower turret traverse than the Panther A and G
* Turret cheeks can be penetrated by high penetration guns (German 88 mm or US 90 mm)

In the autumn of 1944, production of a new variant of the Panther was planned, the Ausf. F variant. This version had stronger front armour on its hull (80 mm), its sides (50 mm), and the front part of its roof (25 mm). The Schmalturm 605 turret, developed by the company Daimler-Benz AG, was slightly smaller than the standard Panther turret. This allowed the forward armour to be reinforced up to 120 mm, at an inclination of 20°. The sides of the new turret had a thickness of 60 mm and an inclination of 25°, and the thickness of the gun mantlet reached 150 mm. Stereoscopic rangefinders produced by the company Zeiss were mounted on the sides of the turret. The vehicle was armed with a 75 mm KwK42/1 L/70 or KwK44/1 L/70 gun in a new mantlet.

A project was launched to equip the Panther with the longer 75 mm KwK L/100. Instead of a directional machine gun, the radio operator/gunner used an MP 44 assault rifle. Production plans stipulated that production Ausf. F tanks would only be released with road wheels with internal shock absorbers. During mass production, the tank was supposed to be fitted with a periscope sight with an optical stabilizer. Each tank could, if necessary, be equipped with an FG 1250 night vision device.

In October 1944, production of the Ausf. F was set to launch in the Daimler-Benz plant in Berlin in March 1945. But by January 1945, a single Panther Ausf. G prototype with a Schmallturm turret was ready. Due to the overall difficulty of Germany's situation at the time, only a few prototypes with a narrow turret and 8 tank hulls had been constructed by the end of the war. Some sources indicate that several Ausf. F variants were completed by Daimler-Benz between April 20 and 23, 1945, and they may have been used in combat operations.
