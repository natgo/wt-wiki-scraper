== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29_Sd.Kfz._Index|Sd.Kfz. Index:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 172''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before [[Update 1.41]] as a main tree vehicle, however, in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]] it was shifted to become a gift vehicle for players who previously owned it.

The Panther II comes with the "Fahrgerät" FG1250 IR night vision equipment, which had seen limited service. The driver of the tank also gets an IR vision.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Cupola)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels, tracks and torsion bars are 20 mm thick.
* Side skirts are 5 mm thick and act as additional protection against explosive warhead
* Part of the hull is covered by tracks, adding additional 20 mm of armour

The armour on this variant has better frontal and side armour than the [[Panther F]], which will protect you against the weaker guns at this BR but it won't hold up when facing higher calibre guns such as the [[M3 (90 mm)]], [[D-25T (122 mm)]] and [[20pdr OQF Mk.I (84 mm)]] that you will likely meet at this rank. The best tactic to survive is to not get hit by an enemy attacker, as the crew is quite cramped and will typically be disabled with one well-placed shot. Also, the Panther II can angle its hull slightly more, unlike the other Panthers, which can provide greater protection.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,395|rbMinHp=796}}

As with all Panthers, this tank has excellent mobility both on and off road. One notable difference between the {{PAGENAME}} and the other Panthers is its reverse speed. Comparing to a max -4 km/h reverse speed on the rest of the Panthers, the Panther II provides a -12 km/h reverse speed, which can help a lot in battles.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|KwK43 (88 mm)}}

The Panther II boasts the excellent 88 mm KwK43 with its notably punchy PzGr 39/43 shell, with a reload speed comparable to that of the [[Tiger II (P)|Tiger II]]. Thus, it represents a threat for every tank on the battlefield, even at long ranges. Its rather poor gun handling, however (7.1°/s turret rotation on a stock tank with a level 1 crew) means close-quarters engagements and particularly urban combat should be avoided if possible. This can be somewhat remedied by its ability to neutral steer to acquire a firing solution faster. The optimal ammo loadout is 15 rounds, since it eliminates the ammo racks at the sides of the hull, while still providing a decent quantity of ammunition. It is not recommended to load anything other than PzGr 39/43 shells since it can readily knock out most opponents and it provides consistent ballistic characteristics, while still maintaining a fairly good penetration against sloped armour.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modelled individually.
* Racks 6 and 7 are first stage ammo racks. They total 10 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 6 - 7 - 1 until 5.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-5 into racks 7 then 6. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
* Packing 19&nbsp;''(+31)'' shells will keep the sides of the hull empty.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG34 (7.92 mm)}}

The Panther II's coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 is rather anaemic, and thus, not very versatile. It won't pose much of a threat to any vehicle that doesn't have exposed crew members, and it won't do much damage to aircraft. It can, however, be used to highlight enemy vehicles to friendlies, but it comes with the risk of alerting enemies of an enemy vehicle.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Panther II is a medium tank that performs in many roles. With its powerful gun, it can very effectively take out opponents at its battle rating at both close and long ranges. The turret traverse is slow, which makes close-quarters engagements and urban combat difficult. But, this can be made up for by careful positioning and the use of the tank's neutral steering. The gun has a fairly standard gun depression and a good reload. All in all, the Panther II's armament is decent.

The Panther II is also armed with a 7.92 mm machine gun. This won't do much damage to any enemies except those with exposed crew members. And, it won't do much damage to enemy aircraft. However, it is still useful for spotting enemies and notifying teammates of their presence.

The vehicle's mobility is also quite good. Reverse speed is much better than that of the earlier Panthers, which makes peeking out from behind cover to fire much more viable. On both roads and terrain, the tank is able to reach a respectable top speed, and in general, the mobility is quite nice, and is suited for both crossing the map to reach favourable positions and for close-quarters brawling.

As for armour, the Panther II's protection is the same as that of the [[Panther F]]. It can protect against most small-calibre guns, but won't hold up against larger guns such as those found on the enemy's medium and heavy tanks. The best survival tactic, as usual, is to avoid being hit entirely. The crew compartment (and the turret especially) is quite cramped, and the Panther II can take debilitating damage from even one shot. Many enemies will aim to hit the Panther's turret cheeks, since a hit to the turret can do extreme damage. To prevent this, it is helpful to wiggle the turret from side to side. Although this doesn't always work, it can sometimes throw off the enemy's aim enough so that the shot doesn't do much damage.

The Panther II is a classic medium tank. While it doesn't excel in any one role, it performs well in many. It can snipe, brawl, or do practically anything in between. When the tank's weaknesses are understood, it can be used to great effect to destroy the enemy.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Armed with the impressive KwK43 gun that's great for the BR thanks to the very high accuracy, velocity and rate of fire
* The default APCBC shell has fantastic penetration, and damage potential at all ranges
* The gunner has a really nice set of optics that provides 2.5x-6x of magnification. Great for quick target acquisition at close range, while still being great for long range sniping
* The Panther II's speed and manoeuvrability is almost as good as the Leopard 1's
* Much better frontal armour than the other Panthers. When properly angled, the upper plate is basically immune to anything that isn't packing 250 mm of penetration
* Unlike the other Panthers, this tank actually has a really nice reverse speed
* The gun mantlet is not that large, but it is very tough
* One of the few tanks at this BR that can use night vision

'''Cons:'''

* The night vision gear on the commander's cupola makes it very easy to spot the tank
* Same turret as the Panther F, but at a much higher BR. Taking a straight shot from any contemporary tank is almost guaranteed to end in disaster
* Bad turret traverse. Reacting to flanking enemy's isn't that easy
* The sides of the hull is lined with a lot of ammo. Enemy shells that enter the sides will likely destroy the tank
* Transmission is mounted in the front, meaning that the tank can be immobilized from both front and the rear
* There is some night vision gear on the drivers side of the upper hull. So the gun will have less gun depression than normal over this area of the tank

=== Development ===
In late 1942, German designers started the development of a more powerful and slightly larger version of [[Panther D|Panther]] mounted on a newly designed chassis. In January of 1943, Adolf Hitler agreed on the development of Panther with increased armour protection especially for the needs of the Eastern Front. This project was designated '''Panther II''' and its design was planned along with the development of [[Tiger II (H)|Tiger II]]. In February of 1943, it was decided that Panther II, in its design would resemble Tiger II and would have many common components such as tracks, transmission, suspension and road wheels. Both designs had common components in an attempt to standardize the production. Overall dimensions were very similar to those of [[Panther G]] hull's design was very similar to that of the late model Panther G but with many modernizations such as the arrangement of observation equipment and new engine deck. Its armour protection was significantly increased if compared to any other Panther variant produced. Side armour protection was 60 mm thick while frontal armour protection was 100 mm thick. It was planned to arm Panther II with the latest 75 mm KwK42 L/100 or even 88 mm KwK43 L/71 (without a muzzle brake) gun mounted in a newly designed narrow turret – Turm Panther 2 (Schmale Blendenausführung) (Turret Panther 2 (narrow mantlet variant)) - an early version of the Schmalturm.  The Schmalturm itself was not designed until after the Panther 2 had been cancelled - designed by Rheinmetall in 1944 and to be produced by Daimler-Benz.

The Panther II in the game with the Schmalturm and 8,8 cm KwK43 therefore represents a configuration that never made it out of the suggestion phase.

Panther II's schmale Blendenausführung (narrow mantlet variant) turret was significantly different to the Schmalturm of [[Panther F]]. The Schmalturm turret used on the Panther II in game has armour protection significantly increased if compared to any other Panther turret. The front was 120-125 mm, gun mantlet was 150 mm, while sides and rear were 60 mm and the top was 30 mm thick. Schmalturm had special mountings for infrared device and telescopic range finder. All of those modifications increased Panther II's weight to 47 tons. Panther II was to be powered by a new Maybach HL234 engine with a total power of 900 hp operated by 8-speed hydraulic transmission. Instead, Maybach HL 230 P 30 engine was mounted and Maybach HL234 was later on due to being completed in August of 1945, for future Panther series. It was believed that Panther II's performance would be similar to that of Panther G, while if ever produced Panther II would most likely suffer from the same problems as Tiger II. Simply because of its great weight and high fuel consumption which made it extremely slow. It is also unknown what other modifications would be made if Panther II would be combat tested.

In March of 1943, plans were laid that the production of the first series would start in late 1943 or early 1944 and that by spring of 1944, full-scale production of Panther II would start. On May 20th of 1943, Rheinmetall-Borsig proposed special air-defence turret designed for Panther II, mounted with four 20 mm MG151/20 guns but it never reached prototype stage.

=== Production and cancellation ===
In early 1944, MAN (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nuremberg) was allowed to produce two prototypes but was only able to produce one in early 1945, without the newly designed Schmalturm turret. On May 4th of 1944, it was realized that German industry was unable to start Panther II's production and this project was abandoned in favour of further development of Panther based on lessons learned from Panther II. On June 3rd of 1944, all companies which were to produce Panther II were ordered to instead start the production on the regular Panther tank. The war ended with only one Panther II chassis produced.

The lessons from Panther II, specifically the ''Schmalturm'' turret, would be used on main Panther tank, resulting in the planned [[Panther F]] variant.

===Survivor===
The Americans captured the Panther II chassis and it was shipped to the states. Sometimes after 1946, a Panther G turret was added onto the chassis while it was at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. In the 1960s, the Panther II chassis was transferred to the Smithsonian Institute, who proceeded to give the tank to the Patton Museum at Fort Knox in the 1970s. Following the closure of the Patton Museum, the Panther II is currently at the in-construction National Armor and Cavalry Museum at Fort Benning.<ref name="ArmorJournalPantherII">The Armor Journal.

Having adopted the Tiger II tank in the autumn of 1943, the Ministry of Armaments ordered the development of a new Panther II tank, specifying that maximum compatibility between the assembly of the two tanks be maintained. Development of the new tank design was assigned to the company Henschel & Sohn. The new tank was to have thicker armour (100 mm in the front and 60 mm on the sides) and was to be equipped with a Schmalturm turret. The main armament consisted of an 88 mm 8,8 cm KwK43 L/70 tank gun with a long 70-calibre barrel, the same gun which was installed on the Tiger II (P). The tank's weight had to be increased to 55 tons or more. The main design problem was the lack of a suitable engine for the heavier vehicle. Several options were developed for installing a MAN/Argus LD 220 750 hp engine or a Maybach HL 234 900 hp engine, using an eight-speed hydromechanical AK 7-200 gearbox, but this work was never completed. The chassis of the new Panther consisted of 7 all-metal rollers on a single torsion bar. The tank's treads were 660 mm wide.

By late 1944, the company had only managed to build one tank hull, which for testing purposes was fitted with a turret from a production Panther G. The testing was never completed, and the tank was captured by American troops. This tank's hull is kept in the Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor in Fort Knox.

It is likely that two Panther II prototypes were built which may have participated in battles at the end of the war. Further work, however, virtually stopped. Project E50 was commissioned to replace both the Panther I and the Panther II.
