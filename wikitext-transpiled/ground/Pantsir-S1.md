== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]].
== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Pantsir-S1 doesn't offer a strong armour of any kind, the strongest part of the vehicle is the 40 mm armoured glass that protects the driver. On the front, sides, and rear there is mostly a 5 to 6 mm structural steel armour and high hardness rolled armour. 

The crew placement makes it even more vulnerable, as the 3 crew members are placed near each other, making a single shot lethal for the majority of the time, making this vehicle unsuited for tank-on-tank combat. The best choice is to find natural or artificial cover to avoid being seen or being exposed to enemy fire.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

'''Notes:'''

* The structural steel located on the bottom of the Pantsir-S1 is 35 mm thick, being on the same level of the upper transmission.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Pantsir-S1 is a wheeled vehicle, making any crossing on mud, snow or ice difficult. 

This vehicle moves thanks to the KamAZ 740.632-400, that offers 354 HP at 1,900 RPM. The maximum speed forwards is 70 km/h, while the reverse speed is limited to -10 km/h, making retreats difficult.
