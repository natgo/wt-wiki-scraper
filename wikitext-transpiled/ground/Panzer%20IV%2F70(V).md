== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29_Sd.Kfz._Index|German armoury designation:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 162/1''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before Update 1.41.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, casemate)
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet, shrapnel shield)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick while tracks are 20 mm thick, and torsion bars are 15 mm thick.
* Mudguards are 4 mm thick.
* Tracks (20 mm thick) are used as add-on armour on the casemate.

Befitting of the German casemate destroyer line, the frontal armour on the {{PAGENAME}} is one to be feared. It features a mighty frontal plate of 80 mm sloped at 50°, resulting in an awesome 120 mm of protection. The gun mantlet also is very well protected, and has over 150 mm in some areas. The amazing armour is made better when the player unlocks the "add-on armour" modification, applying tracks to the front and sides of the tank, and results in over 185 mm of protection in some areas. Even with this amazing armour, it is best to use the {{PAGENAME}} at longer ranges, as this allows you to make use of your amazing gun and turns you from a difficult target to a nigh impenetrable one.

However, the side armour is very weak and is able to be penetrated by most things at your BR, so the player should be careful and look out for flankers.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=426|rbMinHp=265|AoAweight=0.4}}

Being based on the chassis of the Panzer IV, the all-round mobility is very solid. The tank is able to reach 43 km/h (27 mph) and hold itself there over most terrains and has very good hull traverse, allowing for quick turns. However the reverse speed is only 7.5 km/h. Not being able to reverse fast enough will sometimes put the player in a very dangerous situation.

{{main|PaK42 (75 mm)}}

The Panzer IV/70(V) bears the 75 mm PaK42 cannon with a rate of fire below average. With the maximum penetration of 192 mm for the stock AP, this gun can frontally penetrate most opponents it will face. With its explosive filler, it can one shot almost all tanks upon penetration. The 935 m/s muzzle velocity allows easy targeting when aiming at moving targets. The gun traverse is average, but the depression of 7 degrees is very good given its small profile, allowing it to go into hull-down position at some place. The gun also comes with a researchable APCR round which has a maximum penetration of a whopping 228 mm, and great velocity of over 1,100 m/s. Note that just like every other APCR shot, it is not good at piercing sloped armour, and its damage is inadequate to take out the opponent with a single shot.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG42 (7.92 mm)}}

The tank has a MG42 commander machine gun with a high fire rate. It is able to quickly finish off the exposed crews of some vehicles. However, its traverse angles are very limited meaning a lot of the time the whole tank has to be moved to get the MG on target. Also the maximum penetration of 13 mm makes it useless against those not-so-lightly-armoured vehicles, like the [[BTR-152A]], the [[M18 GMC]], etc.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->This vehicle is very much a defensive weapon that should only be on the offensive if the situation is desperate. The gun is powerful at this rank. In terms of penetration and muzzle velocity, it will make short work of all but the toughest tanks. When taking fire, however, the Pz IV/70(V)'s protection is inconsistent at best. Shots that strike the sloped upper superstructure are likely to bounce, but anywhere else and the shell will almost certainly penetrate at closer ranges. It is best to avoid confrontation if possible and let the other members of the team take the damage to allow the player to pick and choose the engagement. Ideally, the enemy won't have a chance to return fire. Allow room between the Panzer IV/70(V) and the enemy, and avoid traversing high-traffic areas; instead, keep an eye on them from a distance and let the enemy come towards the Panzer IV/70(V).

Urban areas should be avoided if possible. Entering such an area is an invitation for the enemy to flank, and the closeness of the engagements negates the main advantage of this tank: the gun. Engaging the enemy at close range doesn't utilize the L/70's excellent penetration at range.

=== Arcade battles ===
In Arcade battles, with the shot indicator showing the player where shots will land, the high-velocity L/70 can accurately hit targets at long ranges, and targets on the move as the shells arrive quickly at the target. The penetration indicator, which changes colour based on the chance of successful penetration, is a problem for the IV/70 (V). It highlights the weak areas of the tank to enemy players, making the weak spots obvious.

Arcade tends to be faster-paced than Realistic and Simulator, so the lack of a turret may be a large detriment as being flanked is quite common in this mode.

=== Realistic/Simulator battles ===
With a lack of markers above tanks and larger combat zones, Realistic and Simulator suit this vehicle well. Taking up a concealed firing position and engaging enemies from a distance is what this tank excels at. Be mindful of flanking attacks though, if consideration of exposed flanks and careful checking of these areas is not performed, it will likely be too late to respond to an enemy on a flank or behind. Keeping with the 'anti-tank gun with treads' analogy, zooming across the map and looking for enemies is not how this tank should be played. Let the enemy do the work because this tank is very poorly suited to assaulting. Usage of the binoculars is highly advised as they allow a zoomed-in 360-degree view without having to move the vehicle.

At the start of the match, the Panzer IV/70(V) is best used as a sniper for most of the times. The player can adapt their tactics from the StuG IIIs and the Jgdpz. 38t. A good way to get kills is to find a spot that:

* provides hard cover
* overlooks a key street / passage way
* has bushes to hide in
* is not too close to the frontline

This way the player can use the bushes to hide the Pz IV/70. If any opponent appears in the sight, the player can kill it easily with the great penetration, velocity and damage of the main cannon. If the enemy notices the player, either go back in cover until they are distracted, or utilize the sturdy frontal armour and be a "heavy tank". It can bounce quite some shells, given that the enemy's guns aren't strong enough.

As the match progresses, the player can use the Pz IV/70 as a medium tank since it has good top speed and traverse. Go cap some points and help the teammates to push. With its low profile, the Pz IV/70 can find a comfortable corner around a point and ambush any point-cappers. Now the situational awareness comes into place, as this vehicle lacks a turret, meaning it cannot respond quickly to close-quarter sudden encounters. Also note that the side armour is extremely thin, so even if the player thinks they're just angling a little bit, shells like the Soviet 85 mm / 122 mm will still penetrate with ease.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

* [[IS-2]], [[ISU-122]], [[SU-152]]/[[ISU-152]]: The Pz IV/70 relies on its frontal armour a lot to survive, so the biggest threats are generally the vehicles with high penetration. These machines with high-calibre guns pose the biggest threat, as their APHEBC shells will slice through the Pz IV/70's frontal armour like butter, and their damage is more than enough to kill all the crew inside. Try and finish them off first before they see you. If they do, quickly go to a nearby cover and either call for help, or wait until they fire / are distracted.
* [[ARL-44]]: the ARL 44's 90 mm SA45 gun can cut through the Pz IV/70's armour with no effort from almost any practical combat range. Its upper frontal plate is completely immune to your shells, and its lower plate also has a habit of causing ricochets. Fortunately, its turret armour is easily penetrated by your gun, resulting in most or all of the turret crew being knocked out or even the ammunition at the back of the turret being detonated.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent firepower: decent rate of fire and good accuracy for the main gun
* Stock shell has great penetration and damage, and can easily penetrate and take out most opponents like the [[T-34-85]], [[M4A2 (76) W]]/[[M4A3 (76) W|A3 (76) W]] , [[IS-1]], etc. with a single shot
* Low profile provides excellent concealment
* Sloped 80 mm frontal armour provides good protection against most of the opponents, and is especially boosted with add-on armour. It is frontally immune to 76 mm Shermans, the T-34-85 and the M18 GMC
* Decent acceleration and excellent cross country performance
* Adequate gun depression of 7 degrees for a compact hull
* Superb zoom, up to x9.2 magnification, allowing for extreme range kills

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks a turret which limits its combat potential and makes it vulnerable to flankers
* Closely packed crew meaning a penetration from any angle will likely to destroy the tank
* Poor side armour, extremely weak against APBCs like the Soviet 85 mm
* The downward side of the gun mantlet is prone to shot traps (shell ricocheting down into the hull roof) which is lethal
* Although frontal armour is thick, it can still get knocked out with a single shot by the [[IS-2 (Family)|IS-2]] regardless the angle and distance

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
This variant of the anti-tank gun was developed in two different versions by the companies Vomag AG and Alkett. Though similar in combat power and armour protection, these machines were significantly different in appearance.

In August 1944, Vomag began producing its own Panzer IV/70 (V) variant with a 75 mm gun. The gun itself was positioned slightly to the right of the tank's longitudinal axis to allow better use of the vehicle's internal space. Due to the great length of the guns, they were held with a special bracket during non-combat movement. The destroyer's weight was increased to 26 tons. The great length of the barrel and the forward-weighted armour (80 mm) made the vehicle unbalanced, giving it low cross-country ability. Because of this, it was nicknamed "Guderian's duck" by the troops. The front pair of road wheels were made entirely of metal. This tank destroyer had "Schürzen" side skirts which protected the lower sides of the tank from anti-tank and hollow-charge projectiles. Vomag made a total of 930 of these tank destroyers. 

The Panzer IV, Panzer IV/70 (A), and Panzer IV/70 (V) also had a commander's version produced, with a crew of five men, reduced ammunition, and an additional radio station.

The powerful armament of these vehicles made them quite popular with the Wehrmacht's anti-tank divisions. These self-propelled guns were widely used in combat operations during the final part of the war, including: the battle of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge as well as on the Eastern Front. It was very successful as a tank destroyer due to its low profile, accurate gun and good armour protection, but performed poorly when used out of role as a substitute for tanks or assault guns to support infantry. This was increasingly necessary in the later stages of the war from late 1944 to 1945, because there was often nothing else available to the badly depleted German armoured units.
