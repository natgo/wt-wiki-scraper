== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Direct Hit"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7350-event-export-order-en|2021 Export Order]] event.

The Pbil m/40 is an armoured car with a 20 mm autocannon. It has light armour but a large 6-person crew, and the ability to go the same speed forward and backwards. Its speed allows it to get into objectives and flanking position quickly, which allows it to strike the weak side of tanks, offsetting the relatively low penetration of its rounds.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''
* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Wheel (tires)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The fast speed allows the Pbil m/40 to get into positions where the enemy team would not suspect you. Take advantage of your 20 mm cannon's high rate of fire to quickly dispose of unaware tanks. If you are engaging someone in CQC, you should try to take out their gunner or barrel before trying to finish your enemy off, although you should be able to penetrate most enemy tanks frontally. You can also utilise its speed to reach capture points early before attacking the enemy, which will also help your team as you are essentially scouting for them when they catch up to you.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Its AP-T belt can penetrate most tanks at its BR
* Its 20 mm has a high rate of fire, making quick work of most tanks
* Fast reload allows for almost continuous fire
* High top speed of 78 km/h both forwards and backwards
* Great survivability due to a crew of 6
* Modules in the tank are somewhat small and difficult to damage

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turret traverse, does not respond well to being flanked
* Turn radius is large since it has a long hull and it is a wheeled vehicle
* It has next to no armour all round

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== [[wt:en/news/7348-development-export-order-pansarbil-m-40-en|Devblog:]] ===
In 1937, the Danish Army requested the development of an armoured car from the Swedish AB Landsverk company. Developed under the name 'Lynx', three of the 18 units ordered were already shipped to Denmark before the outbreak of WWII. However, after the outbreak of hostilities, Sweden placed an export ban on all military equipment and the remaining Lynx armoured cars remained in Sweden.

Subsequently, the Swedish military commissioned the remaining vehicles into its own service under the designation Pansarbil m/39 while already issuing an order for 30 more vehicles to be built. Part of this order was licensed out to Volvo, with these vehicles receiving the designation Pansarbil m/40. The vehicles remained in Swedish service until 1958 before being decommissioned and sold off to the Dominican Republic where the last units remained in service until the mid 1990's.
