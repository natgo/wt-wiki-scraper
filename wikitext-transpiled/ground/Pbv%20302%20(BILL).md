== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The frontal hull armour of the tank is piked and has an additional plate on top of it, effectively giving some protection against bad 23 mm ammunition (like some of the SPAA and medium tanks still use) and 12.7 mm ammunition. Any random spray of such weapons that is not directed to the very top of the roof (where the plate ends) will do no real damage, as even LFP hits tend to get stuck in the transmission. The 30 mm will likely penetrate unless the tank is also angled up. When the tank is swimming, frontal plate swings out, allowing the 23 mm to penetrate the hull.

The sides and the back of the hull are rather strange and have unexpected levels of protection across the board for no explainable reason. Overall, they are somewhat weak and will only stop 12.7 mm ammunition when angled, deflecting poor 23 mm ammunition as well.

The turret overall has poor armour. It has a shield for the gunner on the very front, but the optics can be penetrated by 12.7 mm when looking directly at the enemy, so knowledgeable opponent can always do something to stop the Pbv302. Not only that, but the cupolas on the roof are even more vulnerable and allow to take out everyone but the loader with just the HMG if opponent knows about these weaknesses. The very back has some empty space, so sometimes shots directed there will do nothing, but it's not a good idea to count on it against anyone but Soviets, since the armour can detonate sensitive APHE and can be overpressured easily at the same time.

The roof is overall very weak and should not be relied upon against any kind of airstrike. The launcher is also located very high and can be hit with chemical ammunition to overpressure the tank beneath it or hit with extremely powerful kinetic shells (like APFSDS) to detonate it.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=384|rbMinHp=239}}

Pbv 302 is rather slow and clumsy for its rank and BR, being much slower than most medium tanks, but it sometimes compensates it with ability to swim.

{{main|Akan m/47D (20 mm)}}

The regular gun installed in the turret is very weak and is below weakest SPAA of the BR in terms of efficiency. This is mostly because the ammunition used in the gun is extremely poor and even after research the tank can only use HVAP instead of APDS, which means that it's efficiency against angled armour is effectively 0. The gun also cannot aim to the right because of the cupolas, so tank must keep enemy light vehicles on its left to fight them.

The gun is also not very good against aircraft due to a limited maximum elevation of 36°, but this can be compensated by standing on a hill, which is what Pbv 302 will often do to use its real primary weapon - the ATGM.

{{main|Rbs 56}}

The pole on the top of the turret is housing the ATGM and guiding mechanism for it. While it can guide the missiles by default in third person view, to properly use it player must press "Select special weapon or ATGM" hotkey or multi-function menu key. This will move the sniper scope to the ATGM, but also disable turret controls. The pole can turn 30 degrees to the sides of the turret. Since the turret cannot be moved in this aiming mode, sudden corrections would have to be made with the hull, which might affect the missile trajectory in bad ways. To regain controls of everything, use of "reset weapon selection" is recommended over any other option.

[[File:Pbv 302 bill overhill shot example.jpg|thumb|right|The launcher can still guide missiles and hit targets even when not entirely exposed. This works in RB.]]

The main reason to fear the PBV 302 are the RB 56 BILL II missiles. These missiles have top-down attack style, meaning they need to be guided above enemy tank. When operator aims crosshairs onto something, the missile will automatically offset itself by 5 degrees to move above theoretical enemy tank roof. The missile explodes downward almost immediately if it flies above anything "tank-like", even if it is a dead tank or allies. This means, that the missile can be aimed directly at the tank that is behind an obstacle or a hill as well, since the missile will fly above it. It is necessary to guide the missile as close towards theoretical enemy tank weak spots as possible as the explosion is rather precise.

The BILL missiles have extremely high penetration when compared to TOW-2B of other nations, meaning that even in the case of a bad hit they often deal enough damage to make the target afraid, but they have virtually zero penetration power when hitting enemy head-on (in case they hit enemy turret the missile explodes into hull, but when it hits the hull it does nothing at all) and mostly deal no overpressure damage when hitting the bottom of enemy tanks.

The actual damage of missiles is very dependent on the height of explosion and enemy ammo rack placement. The lower the missile explodes, the closer the explosion will be to the turret front, the higher the missile explodes, the higher the chance of hitting the mandatory back ammo racks directly and overpenetrating the entire tank all the way to the floor (overpressuring light tanks or hitting most of the turret crew and even more ammo racks in process). Ammo rack hits are nearly always fatal, but module damage can be easily sustained. When attacking most tanks from the front, the best case scenario is to detonate the missiles as high as possible before BILL outstanding penetration power starts to fail.

Efficiency of the missiles against long tanks with the turret on the very back is questionable at best, so it is better to attack them from the side or when they angle up on a hill. ERA covered tanks take very light damage from BILL most of the time, but it is still possible to push HEAT jet into the turret and destroy them, although this might take up to 14 missiles from two Pbv 302 at once if they also have NERA. NERA tanks with inert ammo racks can also survive a hit into turret and attack should be aimed into middle of the tank, just past NERA screens (by intentionally lowering the missile)

The reload for ATGM takes around 14 seconds as long as the loader is alive, but may take twice as long if he isn't. Rearm on a capture point takes about 6 seconds per missile, allowing to quickly grab more missiles and run. In AB mode, rearm upon emptying the entire ammo rack outside capture point takes 40 seconds, which is also very fast.

The missile has some downsides. The missiles have a dead zone of 10 m, so they can't really be used at ramming range (which is still better than TOW-2B dead zone range), and will detonate above allies and dead tanks that aren't literally infront of the Pbv 302. The fuse also does not react to aircraft, unlike with other top-down missiles, and missile has a rather short maximum range, so BILL cannot be used as a makeshift SAM, unless enemy helicopter is being extremely stubborn and flies straight, so it can be hit directly.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

*Early access to top-down ATGM - can easily obliterate any camping tank with only the [[CM-25]] being the real competition
*High compatability with wide variety of cover at any range
*Can also guide ATGM with its launcher in third person view - something other IFV-like tanks cannot do at all
*While not quite as unkillable as some other ATGM tanks at the rank, it can take some hits and is not open-topped
*ECCM on ATGM (Cannot be jammed)
*Can swim

'''Cons:'''

*Direct ATGM control can be quite awkward due to the turret no longer working when using it
*The tank doesn't work like an IFV
**Terrible ammo for autocannon, will not even make a dent in most light tanks armour, even SPAA might survive full belt 
**Disappointing mobility for rank VI
**Extreme performance drop if hit in the hull
*Difficult, but not impossible to destroy with kinetic shells when only exposing the launcher, as APFSDS can detonate it; Draws a lot of attention when attacks with ATGM
*No thermal sight, some late tanks can spot it and move around it before it notices (irrelevant in AB)
*Fights against tanks with ERA on the roof can be extremely difficult
