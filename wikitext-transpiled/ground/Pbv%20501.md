== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the Swedish designation for the [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1]], acquired from Germany after the fall of the Soviet Union. In defense decisions 92, Sweden wanted to invest a portion of the military funding to mechanized infantry, during this decision they decided to buy 433 vehicles of different BMP-1 models. These {{PAGENAME}} were sent to the Czech Republic to be modified to Swedish standards and would be used until 2010, when the {{PAGENAME}} were sold to the Czech Republic which later sold them to Iraq.

The {{PAGENAME}} was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. Compared to other [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1s]], it lacks the ATGMs most BMP vehicles are equipped with in-game, giving it a limited ability to counter heavier armoured vehicles at distance. However, it is still equipped with its 73 mm [[2A28 (73 mm)|2A28]] gun making it familiar weapon to use for those who are experienced with [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1]] vehicles. Having thin armour makes this vehicle an easy target for tank cannons but also autocannons and heavy machine guns, making it a vehicle better suited for ambush and supporting roles.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|2A28 (73 mm)}}Just like the BMP-1, the {{PAGENAME}} is armed with the 2A28 main cannon. However, it lacks any sort of ATGM systems compared to the BMP-1, which severely reduces it's overall offensive capabilities. 

The PG-9 HEAT will primarily be your main shell in combat. Capable of penetrating up to 300mm of armor, a well placed shot on the enemy tanks will usually result in most critical components being damaged. However, care must be taken as the {{PAGENAME}} lacks any sort of stabilizer, which severely reduces the chances of hitting a target while going full speed.

The OG-9 HE is almost useless at this BR, as most tanks at this have closed rooftops. It should only be used for attacking lightly armored targets, nothing more. 

The cannon is equipped with an auto loader, allowing for consistent 6 second reloads. As this tank lacks any ATGM systems, the turret speed has been improved over the base BMP-1 by a small margin. However, the cannon has a few flaws. First, the ballistic performance of the rounds is mediocre, at 665 m/s for the PG-9 HEAT and 290 m/s for the OG-9 HE, making long range shots all the more difficult to land. Second, the gun depression is limited to only -4°, similar to other Russian tanks in the Swedish Tech Tree. This will make a change of play-style necessary, as most Swedish tanks have good gun depression.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

* Low silhouette
* HEAT ammunition

* No ATGMs unlike other [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1s]]
* Thin armour
