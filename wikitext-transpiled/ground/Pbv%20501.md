== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the Swedish designation for the [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1]], acquired from Germany after the fall of the Soviet Union. In defense decisions 92, Sweden wanted to invest a portion of the military funding to mechanized infantry, during this decision they decided to buy 433 vehicles of different BMP-1 models. These {{PAGENAME}} were sent to the Czech Republic to be modified to Swedish standards and would be used until 2010, when the {{PAGENAME}} were sold to the Czech Republic which later sold them to Iraq.

The {{PAGENAME}} was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. Compared to other [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1s]], it lacks the ATGMs most BMP vehicles are equipped with in-game, decreasing the vehicle's effectiveness at long range. However, it is still equipped with its 73 mm [[2A28 (73 mm)|2A28]] gun, a familiar weapon for those who are experienced with the [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1]]. Its thin armor leaves much to be desired, but its autoloaded gun and good mobility make it a good brawler in close range engagements.

{{main|2A28 (73 mm)}}

Just like the BMP-1, the {{PAGENAME}} is armed with the 2A28 main cannon. However, it lacks an ATGM launcher compared to the BMP-1, which decreases the vehicle's long range engagement capabilities.

The PG-9 HEAT will be your primary choice of ammunition in combat. Capable of penetrating up to 300 mm of armour, a well placed shot fired at the enemy tanks will usually result in most critical components being damaged if not destroyed. However, care must be taken as the {{PAGENAME}} lacks any sort of stabilizer, which severely reduces the chances of hitting a target while going full speed. The vehicle comes equipped with a cruise control setting of CC BATTLE, however, which keeps the gun stable albeit at a very low (around 3-4kph) moving speed - something that may let you get an accurate shot off in certain situations. 

The OG-9 HE is best left ignored. The PG-9 HEAT shell mentioned above has actual armor penetration while the OG-9 does not, and also overpressures light vehicles on a decently placed hit. As open top vehicles start becoming less and less common on the battlefield, OG-9 is simply irrelevant and there is very little reason to take the shell over its HEAT counterpart.

The cannon is equipped with an autoloader, allowing for a consistent 6 second reload. As this tank lacks ATGMs, the turret speed compared to the BMP-1 has been slightly improved. However, the cannon has a few shortcomings that may necessitate some player compensation. First off, the ballistic performance of the rounds are fairly mediocre, at 665 m/s for the PG-9 HEAT and 290 m/s for the OG-9 HE, making long range shots a challenge if the player is inexperienced with the gun's ballistics. Second, the gun depression is limited to only -4°, similar to other Russian tanks in the Swedish Tech Tree. This will make a change of play-style necessary, as most Swedish tanks have good gun depression and can frequently use terrain features almost no other nations can utilize.

== Usage in battles ==

The {{PAGENAME}} is in essence a BMP-1 stripped of its ATGM armament. To some this may seem like an unacceptable downgrade - the 4 missiles the BMP-1 carries have good explosive mass, speed and let the vehicle engage far away targets effectively, and this is a valid point. However, the {{PAGENAME}} makes up for it by having a full 1 BR lower placement than the regular BMP-1, and still retains the 2A38 73mm cannon. The 2A38 is an acquired taste; To those who don't like the low velocity and sometimes middling damage, the gun is a lackluster weapon, while to those who know the ballistics it can be a surprisingly effective cannon with a good reload rate. 

Most of the Pbv 501's uses will be in urban combat. The vehicle lacks the weaponry to handle long range engagements, and even with good aim at the helm the lacking muzzle velocity and inability to use terrain hamper the vehicle's long range capabilities. At close range, however, these are less of a concern, and the fairly low profile and punchy, moderately fast reloading cannon serve the vehicle well. As the gun isn't an autocannon it has the raw punching power to knock out components more consistently, and the overall damage isn't too bad either. As Sweden's other vehicles generally excel at long range but lack close range advantages like the [[Ikv 91]] or [[VIDAR]], the Pbv 501 can add some valuable brawling capabilities (albeit as a glass cannon) to the lineup. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Low silhouette
* Punchy gun with an autoloader
* High power-to-weight ratio and quick acceleration  
* Excels at urban brawling, something Swedish vehicles generally aren't suited for
* Has access to scouting 
'''Cons:'''

* No ATGMs unlike other [[BMP-1 (Family)|BMP-1s]]
* Thin armour
* Lacking gun depression of -4 compared to the common -10 or more on other contemporary Swedish vehicles
* Poor cannon ballistics
* Sometimes has inconsistent spalling
