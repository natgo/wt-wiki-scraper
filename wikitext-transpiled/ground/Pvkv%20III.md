== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Like the [[Pvkv II]], the Pvkv III shares its hull with the [[Strv m/41 S-II|Strv m/41]], and as such has acceptable hull armour for its BR. However, due to the incredibly thin turret armour which is unlikely to resist the .50 cals found on many vehicles it will face, it is not recommended to fight head-on.

The floor armour in the turret combined with the gun placement makes anything but the largest HE, APHE, and HEAT unlikely to incapacitate the turret and hull crew in one shot, allowing the machine gunner and driver to retreat and repair. Due to this, a hull-down position is recommended.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)

'''Notes:'''

* Tracks are 15 mm thick, while suspension wheels and torsion bars are 10 mm thick.
* Belly armour is 8 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Pvkv III is very fast for a tank destroyer with a top speed at 43 km/h. With the same engine as on the Strv m/41 S-II, it can climb the steepest of hills and works great on soft terrain. It shines on maps with hills, forests or snow where this tank destroyer maintains its mobility.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

The Pvkv III is a tank destroyer with a fully rotatable turret and great gun depression, an unusual sight at its BR. It is only matched by the Cromwell V and Sherman II.

==== Ammunition ====
With the 57 mm Pvkan m/43, the Pvkv III is a high threat to the enemy with the following shells.

* The slpgr m/43 (APHEBC) shell can penetrate up to 88 mm of armour at 10 m. It is effective at dealing with sloped armour with enough explosive filler capable of knocking out any vehicle in one hit.
* The sgr m/43 is a HE shell and is most effective used on open-topped vehicles and low-flying planes.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The suggested playstyle of the Pvkv III is flanking or sniping. It is effective at defence thanks to its quick reload and great gun depression and with its speed, it Can be a great flanker.

The opponents you may have trouble dealing with is the KV-1, KV-2, T-34, M4A3 (105), Churchill I, ARL-44 because of their thick armour. To deal with these vehicles, you simply need to shoot them in the sides (T-34, M4A3 (105), Churchill I) or in the rear of the turret ring (KV-1 , KV-2 , ARL-44).

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Considerable speed
* Good penetration capabilities
* Good gun depression
* Slightly decent armour angling
* Armour angling and turret positioning results in better hiding behind hills
* The turret and hull are separated leading to great survivability if shot in the turret

'''Cons:'''

* Very tall; hard to hide
* Extremely vulnerable to artillery
* Very thin turret armour
* Very limited range of the machine gun
* Extremely thin top hull armour results in easy death by planes
* Extremely vulnerable to HE and HEAT because of its open turret

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

At the beginning of the Cold War, the Swedish military was looking to equip its armed forces with new armoured units. However, as the state budget didn't allow for the procurement of completely new units, the military resorted to converting existing chassis into new vehicles. As a result, a range of experimental vehicles were hastily designed and tested to act as a stopgap measure until more modern equipment could be acquired.

Among these vehicles was the Pvkv III - a Strv m/41 converted into a tank destroyer by having its old turret replaced with a new one, housing a dedicated 57 mm anti-tank cannon. Differing only from the Pvkv II - a vehicle we already covered in one of our previous articles - by the weapon choice and by the intention to act as a stopgap itself for the Pvkv II until its production could be ramped up, all vehicles underwent testing in the early 1950s. Despite proving itself as a capable vehicle during these tests, the Swedish military soon adopted the Strv 81 into service, making further work on the project redundant and thus leading to the project's cancellation soon thereafter.
