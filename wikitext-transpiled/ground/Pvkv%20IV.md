<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features.

Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' Värjan was an experimental tank destroyer that was developed during the 1950s along with the [[Pvkv II]] and [[Pvkv III]]. The {{PAGENAME}} is based on the hull of [[Strv m/40L]] with an new turret to be able fit the new 57 mm Pvkan m/43 and keep the L-60 hulls in service longer. However, the Pvkv IV was soon cancelled when the [[Strv 74]] entered service.

Introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], the '''{{PAGENAME}} "Värjan"''' is an excellent tank destroyer in the guise of a medium tank, when can be used to its advantages of keeping a distance from its targets. Due to its relatively thin armour and slow turret traverse, it is a bit unsuitable in close combat environments. Speed is not an issue for this vehicle, it can manoeuvre around maps with relative ease, and fast reload and excellent gun elevation and depression makes this vehicle suitable for hiding behind hills and other high positions for cover and the element of surprise.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is classified as a medium tank, but in reality works more like a tank destroyer with very vulnerable characteristics. Based on the [[Strv m/40L]] hull, it has an adequate speed of 50 km/h to move around on the battlefield and get into ambush positions. In ambush positions, the {{PAGENAME}} can utilize its good gun depression which can change the gameplay of the vehicle in combat of certain maps. Open maps with hills and mounds can give extra protection and cover for the vulnerable vehicle due to the elevation and depression. Meanwhile, close combat maps like Sweden and Advance to the Rhine will be to its disadvantage due to the cramped crew space.

The {{PAGENAME}} is an excellent ambush tank, equipped with a powerful 57 mm [[Pvkan m/43 (57 mm)|Pvkan m/43]] designed to knock out vehicles from a distance where it can be relatively safe and protected from enemy fire. It has enough firepower to handle most enemy vehicles it will face; once unlocked, the APDS ammunition it will be efficient at sniping due to high penetration shells, where even heavy tanks' armour will be rendered ineffective. In addition to the APDS ammunition the tank can also fire a decent APHE shell which can easily one shot enemies.  The {{PAGENAME}} will thrive when it can utilize its strong points using the cannon at distance and efficiently use the gun elevation to its advantage.

The {{PAGENAME}} has a few disadvantages, like the weak side and rear armour and cramped crew space but also a slow turret traverse. Due to these weak points, it's easy for light tanks like the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]] and [[M24 (Family)|M24]] to knock out it out. It's also very vulnerable to autocannon and heavy machine gun fire, so most SPAA and light tanks will be able to flank around get in close and out turn the {{PAGENAME}}'s turret. In city or towns the {{PAGENAME}} is at a disadvantage with its slow turret rotation and cramped crew space making it an easy target to knock out for most vehicles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* APDS rounds
* Good cannon
* Decent reload
* Good mobility

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turret traverse
