== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Pvkv m/43 (1963) has a casemate design, and as such, plays best as a sniper. With mediocre armour compared to its peers, it will depend on positioning or tank support in order to survive to deliver its shots. Move with tanks to your front, or find a long range sniping position in order to remain effective and support your team.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Starts with a stock APCBC found on the previous [[Pvkv m/43 (1946)]] and [[Strv m/42 DT]]
- Has access to a powerful APDS
- Great gun depression of -15°
- Relatively mobile
- Wide horizontal gun arc

'''Cons:'''

- APDS is a tier IV modification
- Outdated chassis - narrow tracks and light armour
- Casemated tank destroyer - dead engine = dead Pvkv
- Tall silhouette makes tank vulnerable at hull-down position
- Poor reverse
- Low survivability
- Thin roof armour - 20 mm shells can penetrate the top of the tank, knocking out the crew

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

During World War 2, the need for tank destroyers became evident, and Germany had great success with the [[StuG III G|StuG III]] and StuG IV. Because of the success of those platforms, Sweden decided to create a tank destroyer similar in concept to the StuG's. Landsverk created a design in 1942, based on the chassis of the [[Strv m/42 EH|Strv m/42]]. It was chosen by the Swedish military and was given the designation Pansarvärnskanonvagn m/43, or '''Pvkv m/43''' for short.

The Pvkv m/43 used the chassis of the Strv m/42, but with a casemate superstructure replacing the turret. The superstructure was located at the front of the vehicle, and the glacis was sloped. It had an open tarp to keep the weight down, and used a tarp to protect the crew from the elements. The Pvkv m/43 had a crew of 4, and was initially armed with a 75 mm luftvärnskanonen m/36 antiaircraft gun, modified with a longer barrel for increased armour penetration. The gun could traverse 15 degrees to the left and right. It had a Ksp m/39 machine gun as the secondary armament. It was powered by a Volvo A8B engine producing 360 hp. The gearbox was different than the gearbox of the Strv m/42, and the drive wheels had to be reinforced to handle the increased weight of the vehicle. The Swedish military ordered 87 Pvkv m/43 in 1942, but deliveries were delayed and the last vehicle was delivered in 1948.

In 1954, the vehicle was given an armoured roof to better protect the crew. Other improvements included a muzzle brake, a gun travel lock, and a bore evacuator/fume extractor. The Strv m/41 was retired from service in 1957, which allowed the two Scania-Vabis L603 engines per vehicle to be used in the Pvkv m/43. The two L603 engines produced less horsepower (320 hp) than the Volvo A8B, but were much more reliable. In 1970, the Pvkv m/43 was retired from service, and the guns were used in static fortifications until 1995.
