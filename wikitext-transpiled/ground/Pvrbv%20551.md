== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The survivability of the {{PAGENAME}} is entirely designed for rifle-calibre fire. The chassis is surrounded by plates varying between 5 and 25 mm of thickness, with the front angled to somewhat protect against machine-gun bullets. The {{PAGENAME}} is otherwise entirely exposed to all forms of weaponry, and is expected to be kept behind cover because of this. The launcher is external, and fired by a very exposed launcher and gunner. This means the {{PAGENAME}} has to put distance between itself and the opponent in order to not get knocked out immediately. Ideally, the chassis should be positioned behind cover, only exposing the launcher itself, making it more difficult for enemies to locate the vehicle.

It is recommended to avoid SPAAs and stock autocannon light tanks at all costs, as even a single 23 mm HE-I hit to the launcher or the gunner will overpressurize the entire crew.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=193|rbMinHp=120}}

The {{PAGENAME}} features a 136 hp engine giving the vehicle a speed of 38 km/h. This is a general downgrade in comparison to the [[UDES 33]], as the lesser horsepower makes it slower and less torque capable. The engine is also petrol, giving it a very high RPM compared to other vehicles. This makes it pretty loud, and distinct in sound compared to tanks around it. The {{PAGENAME}} isn't very good in reverse either, as the transmission only has one reverse gear. The neutral steering is good however, as the missile launcher can't fully traverse. This gives it a very comfortable handling when standing still, something the {{PAGENAME}} is meant for.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|Rbs 55}}

The Rbs 55 is the same ATGM launcher found on the [[UDES 33]] but gets access to better munitions. The reload time is the same as the UDES so enemies will be able to replace their crew member quicker than your reload. It also gets less ammo, carrying only 8 rounds instead of 10. It is recommended to take a full ammo load as you will definitely run low during an extended battle. The firing angles are more restricted vertically, with only -13° compared to the UDES' -20°. It is horizontally restricted to the 4 o'clock right and 8 o'clock left positions.

However, there is one big upgrade this launcher gets compared to the UDES; the ammunition. It starts off with the potent RB 55B (I-TOW) but can upgrade to the deadly RB 55C (TOW-2). The RB 55B is a reasonable stock munition, being very similar to the ATGM used by UDES 33. However, the RB 55C variant is one of the more versatile ATGMs at its BR range. With 800 mm of penetration and immunity to jamming, it has the ability to threaten and penetrate almost all vehicles at its BR and even higher. The slightly higher velocity over default missile makes it easier to hit long range targets before they can potentially drive into cover. It's also a Tier II modification so it can be unlocked relatively fast. This makes the launcher one of the most dangerous weapons to face at any range, provided the operator can stay alive, as the gunner is exposed from the waist up on the vehicle.

Both missiles retain unexpected amount of overpressure damage, which can be used to easily knock out clearly superior tanks like the [[IT-1]]. ERA tanks also do not have bottom armour and have holes in frontal turret armour, thus can still be instantly destroyed by hitting them into very specific weak spots.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} is very situational, as the vehicle requires a secure sightline, preferably with a lot of distance. The {{PAGENAME}} can be used in close engagement, when positioned behind teammates. But this is usually at the hope that your team will tank incoming shells for you. Since the reload is slow, and the launcher unable to fire on the move, the {{PAGENAME}} struggles to safely engage opponents safely without any cover. When used behind terrain, the vehicle can safely pull back after launching, and can be difficult to hit due to the small profile of the launcher.

Ideally the {{PAGENAME}} should be played passively. By making use of the profile, the tank should try to stay hull-down while still maintaining a large sightline. Since the vehicle sports deadly ATGM missiles, the {{PAGENAME}} rarely struggles to penetrate from the front. This allows for more creativity, as the vehicle doesn't necessarily need to rely on flanks to deal damage. The vehicle also comes with smoke grenades stock. Although a single salvo, their spread and deploy speed are great, allowing the vehicle to safely retreat without giving the opponent time to react.

{{Notice|Since the missile is easily guided, the Pvrbv 551 works well against helicopters! The missile has to hit the target directly however, as it only detonates on impact.}}

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* RB 55B (I-TOW) is a potent stock ATGM, penetrating 630 mm of armour
* RB 55C (TOW-2) penetrates 800 mm of armour, has a faster velocity of 329 m/s, and is not affected by IRCMs
** The RB 55C is a Tier II upgrade in modifications
** Missiles deal enough overpressure damage to breach some medium tanks
* Comes with a stock 66 mm smoke grenade launcher
* Researchable Night Vision Device

'''Cons:'''

* Has virtually no armour, any heavy calibre machine gun can penetrate it from the front or side
* Gunner is exposed to artillery, aircraft strafing and machine gun fire, crew is exposed to overpressure
** Vulnerable while firing the launcher (especially in RB, where it is more difficult to trade shots)
* Mediocre mobility, slower than most MBTs
* Less gun depression than its predecessor, [[UDES 33]] (-13° instead of -20°)
* Inherits the same Horizontal Guidance problem with its predecessor (only able to rotate the launcher to a certain angle)
* Not effective against ERA tanks, borderline useless against tanks with hard-kill APS

In 1983, the Swedish military gave a contract to Hägglunds and Söner to convert Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 vehicles into Pvrbv 551 anti-tank missile carriers. The Ikv 102 and Ikv 103, infantry support vehicles mounting a 105 mm gun, had become obsolete in the past few years. At the same time, the same companies were contracted to convert Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 vehicles into Lvrbv 701 surface-to-air missile carriers. The hull of the Ikv 102/Ikv 103 was plated over, in order to extend the crew compartment the full length of the vehicle. The engine was replaced by a Ford V-6 engine. The armament consisted of a TOW ATGM launcher in the center of the hull, which was raised up through a circular opening in the roof of the vehicle - covered by a two piece hatch - in order to fire the weapon. 55 Pvrbv 551 vehicles were delivered to the Swedish military.

=== [[wt:en/news/6633-development-swedish-ground-vehicles-pvrbv-551-en|Devblog]] ===
During the 1970's, the Swedish military came to realize that their anti-tank and anti-air regiments within the armored branch were substantially lacking in mobility and protection. As a result, studies were initiated in an effort to find potential solutions to this problem.

During the conducted studies, it was found that the previously decommissioned Ikv 102 and 103 SPG's could relatively easily be converted into mobile ATGM and SAM platforms. This sparked the development of several projects in the late 1970's, all of which aimed to convert the old chassis into modern missile carriers.

By the early 1980's, the viability of this undertaking had already successfully been proven through the creation of several prototypes. However, the decision was then made to not simply convert the old chassis, but to substantially rebuild them in order to facilitate necessary improvements.

By the mid 1980's, the work was considered complete and two new vehicles were developed as a result - the Pvrbv 551 and Lvrbv 701 - the former being the ATGM carrier, whereas the latter represented the SAM variant. Both vehicles subsequently entered service with the Swedish military in the mid to late 1980's.

In total, 57 Ikv 103s were converted into the Pvrbv 551 missile carriers, which served with the Swedish military from 1984 until 2000, when the last of the operational units was retired from service.
