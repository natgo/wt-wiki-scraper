== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG34 (7.92 mm)}}

The small calibre of the MG34 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Shoulder stabilizer

'''Cons:'''

* Somewhat weak gun at its BR

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
By 1942, action in Operation Barbarossa had seen the Pz.38(t) lose its capability as a regular tank, instead preforming reconnaissance missions, but production capacity for Pz.38(t) chassis still remained. As a solution Pz.38(t) n.A., which stood for Neuer Art, was a proposed modernized version of the Pz.38(t), but was rejected and Pz.38(t) chassis were instead used to build other vehicles such as the [[Marder III]] and [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)|Hetzer]].

=== [[wt:en/news/8284-development-pz-kpfw-38-t-n-a-the-new-type-en|Devblog]] ===
Experimental light tank Pz.Kpfw.38 (t) n.A. was developed in 1941 by the Czech company BMM to participate in the reconnaissance tank contest for the German army. The tank was built on the chassis of the light Czechoslovak tank LT vz.38 and was distinguished by a more powerful gun, a new 8-cylinder engine, bigger wheels and wider tracks. Despite the best results in mobility trials, the tank was denied mass production due to high fuel consumption, a cramped turret and a 37 mm gun, which was considered excessive. Developments under the program Pz.Kpfw.38 (t) n.A. were further developed into light tank destroyer Jagdpanzer 38(t), also known as the Hetzer.
