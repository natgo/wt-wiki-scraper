== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29_Sd.Kfz._Index|Sd.Kfz. Index:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 141/2''') is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before [[Update 1.41]].

This is a Panzer III, upgraded to carry a short 75 mm KwK37 cannon, which can also be found on a number of [[Pz.IV F1|Panzer IV variants]], as mounting the [[KwK40 L43 (75 mm)|infamous long variant]] of the 75 mm gun failed, so a compromise was made. Panzer III N is referred to as the assault variant of the [[Panzer III (Family)]], and it retains a body of the Panzer III L and M variants.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (cupola, gun mantlet)

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Spaced armour covering lots of the tank
* Fast-firing main gun
* Fast automotive characteristics, including acceleration and track traverse
* Tracks cover much of the sides, meaning a little better staying power under artillery barrage

'''Cons:'''

* Armour is almost never enough under sustained fire
* Enemy tanks with sloped armour easily bounce your shots if not carefully aimed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. N variant was an assault tank. Ausf. L and Ausf. M chassis were used to produce this variant. This variant was produced to meet the need for a stronger tank, one that could more effectively handle the Soviet T-34 and KV-1. A 75 mm long-barreled gun could not be installed in the turret due to the turret box's limited size. The designers decided to use the short-barreled 7.5cm KwK37 L/24 gun along with hollow-charge shells. This explosive projectile packed more punch than the 5 cm KwK39 L/60 gun. To accommodate this change, the gun's mantlet was redesigned. The gun's recoil mechanisms were improved, the single-hinged hatch for the command turret was replaced with a two-hinged hatch, and the thickness of the commander's cupola walls was increased to 100 mm. This variant's operational weight was 23,000 kg. Most of the tanks received a 5 mm Schürzen side skirts to protect the tank's hull and turret.

Production of Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. N tanks began in June 1942 and lasted until August 1943. A total of 700 of these tanks were built. 3 were built from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. J tanks, 447 from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. L tanks, 213 from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. M tanks, and 37 from other variants after they had returned from the front.

This tank variant earned a good reputation with the troops and, by the beginning of the battle at the Kursk Bulge, the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS owned 155 vehicles of this type.

Some of the tanks was transferred to Romania, Slovakia, and Croatia. Tanks of this variant were used until the end of the war and were transferred to Allied forces after Germany's surrender.
