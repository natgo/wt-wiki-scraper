== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. This Panzer IV is a Ausf. J variant. The biggest difference with the German [[Pz.IV J]] is the lack of a pintle-mounted MG over the turret, the lack of Ostketten for a better mobility in the snow, and the lack of add-on armour.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

If you stay mobile and far from adversaries, or stay in a hulldown position for sniping, the Pz IV is survivable. In urban and CQC situations, unless in a downtier, survivability is lower than other medium tanks at the battle rating.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The mobility of this tank is another flaw (being the heaviest of the entire Panzer 4 series). Although it can achieve a decent speed, it will take time for it to accelerate to top speed. Engine is under powered and the tracks are narrow, which results in poorer cross-country performance than many heavier tanks.

The turret traverse speed is slow since it is rotated manually.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''PzGr 39'''; APCBC shell - This is the main ammo type, and can confidently penetrate enemy armour due to the explosive filler. This should be the main ammo that your crew carries even as you unlock the other two shell types.
* '''Hl.Gr 38B'''; HEAT shell - it is recommended to completely avoid this kind of shell as its performance is vastly inferior in all aspects compared to APCBC or APCR ammo used by this tank.
* '''PzGr 40'''; APCR shell - This type of ammo should be used only if there is trouble penetrating the opponent, or trying to hit a fast moving tank at some distance. However, its damaging potential is much lower because it has no explosive filler to further enhance damage after the penetration.
* '''Sprgr. 34'''; HE shell - Carry only very few of these. They are useless against anything other than unarmoured AA vehicles, to which it is lethal.
* '''K.Gr.Rot Nb.''' - Smoke shells are useful to blind enemy vehicles that block your advance while being being too remote for you to disable.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG34 (7.92 mm)}}

The MG34 can deal with open-topped vehicles, it can also be used to assist in marking targets for friendly forces. As there is no external MG, it has a very limited use when dealing with hostile aircraft.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Pz.IV suffers from its slow, manual turret traverse rate. This causes the Panzer IV to lose flexibility in reacting to close encounters without turning the entire hull around. As such, it is recommended not to use the Panzer IV as a front-line assaulter in combat.

While its KwK40 L48 main gun is quite powerful for its BR, it has obvious weaknesses in its armour and should not be used as a main line tank or you will quickly be back to the hangar screen. Tactics-wise, the Panzer IV is perfect for sniping and ambushes, where the slower turret traverse rate affects its combat performance less. Attack from a distance, especially while that enemy is focused on other allies in the team. Ambushes can also work in close-range events when watching corners, street intersections, and choke points, but be wary of any enemies trying to outmanoeuvre the Panzer IV as it would require drastic action with the slow turret rate. Try not to engage the enemy in a straight-up front confrontation as most enemies would be able to easily cleave through the front armour and knock out your vehicle.

Although any tank of Rank III can destroy the Panzer IV pretty quickly, the tanks that mostly need to avoided in open combat are [[IS-2 (Family)|IS-2]], [[KV-2 (Family)|KV-2]], [[SU-152]], [[Tiger H1]] and [[Panther D|Panther]] tanks. Most of the [[:Category:Heavy tanks|heavy tanks]] that it will face include Tigers, the last of [[KV-85|KV series]], [[IS-1|IS-1s]], and even some [[IS-2|IS-2s]]. Particularly, IS-2s will be the toughest opponent and can take out the Panzer IV with one hit. Avoid frontal confrontation at all cost. Instead try to be sneaky and attack them from the sides where they become vulnerable.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* 75 mm APCBC shell has high penetration and great post-penetration, can knock out all common foes with a single shot
* -10° gun depression is very handy when fighting among hills
* Satisfactory speed (~35 km/h on average) allows it to keep up with most teammates
* Smoke grenades help to conceal the tank when needed
* 80 mm frontal hull armour may deflect some shells when angled properly
* 5 mm turret side skirt protects it from tanks using HEAT/HE shells

'''Cons:'''

* Extremely poor turret traverse, targeting process is slow and dangerous
* Weak survivability: cramped crew, thin frontal turret & side hull armour. Usually gets frontally penetrated easily
* Sluggish acceleration
* Large transmission at the front often gets broken by frontal hits, immobilising the whole tank
* APCBC struggles to penetrate well-armoured tanks at long range (>800 m)
* Low reverse speed of -8 km/h may put the player in a fatal situation

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Finnish bought 15 '''''Panzerkampfwagen'' IV''' ('''Pz.Kpfw. IV''') in 1944, and another 40 Pz IV and StuG III, but only the first 15 arrived. Unfortunately they arrived too late to combat the soviets, but they were used against the Nazi during the Lapland retreat. After the war the Pz Iv (or as known to the Finns, Pzkw IV Ausf. J) was used in movies and as training vehicles.
