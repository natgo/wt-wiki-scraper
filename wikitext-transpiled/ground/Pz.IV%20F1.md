== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29_Sd.Kfz._Index|Sd.Kfz. Index:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 161''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before Update 1.41.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Appearing in 1941 at about the same time as the PzKpfw III Ausf. J, this model saw substantial changes. The basic armour thickness was increased from 30 mm to 50 mm on all front faces (hull, superstructure, turret) and to 30 mm on the sides. The supplementary bolted armour was dropped. The superstructure front was changed back to a single straight plate, and the hull machine gun was changed from the Gimbal mount to a ball mount, Kugelblende 50. In the game, compared to the previous modification  [[Pz.IV E]], F1 offers enhanced armour, mostly on the turret, which used to be a "weak spot" on the E variant. Side & Rear hull armour has been improved to 30 mm, and the entire upper front hull is now a single plate of 50 mm steel - while some places are actually weaker, there are no longer any "holes" in the armour easily penetrable by any gun.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

Any veteran of the Ausf. C and E should feel right at home in this vehicle. Usage is the same, players should only be careful of some possible new opponents, coming from higher Tiers. In general, it is still an excellent short range corner-cleaner.

The gun is very powerful, with a great rate of fire, but it suffers from low penetration. HEAT shells can be used to solve this issue, but they do a lot less post-penetration damage. The Pz.IV F1 is often capable of annihilating an enemy vehicle with a single AP shell. It has a fair amount of armour as well, however, due to the lack of an actual slope it may seem considerably more fragile than some Soviet vehicles when facing AP shells.

Against most threats, it is often wiser to close in with the enemy vehicle, to make targeting the weakest areas possible, increasing the chance of successful penetration. When engaging vehicles at close range, it is, for example, a good idea to count on the slower turret speed of the Soviet machines, allowing the player to circle around them with ease and deliver devastating shots. Bear in mind that while this tank can easily obliterate any vehicle at its own BR, against higher tier enemies the relatively poor penetration of the gun and very slow shell travel speed can become a problem. Avoiding direct encounters, and using flanking manoeuvres is advisable.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast reload speed for short 75 mm (Great when using HEAT rounds)
* Decent mix of protection and mobility
* Good traverse rate
* Excellent gun depression

'''Cons:'''

* Poor AP penetration at range
* Weak side armour
* Huge and weak commander cupola
* Frail engine and ammo rack
* Narrow tracks -> poor performance in soft/sandy terrain (most notable in realistic modes)
* F1 is a bit heavier and slower than previous Pz.IV tanks

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

=== Development ===
The '''Pz.Kpfw. IV's''' creation, like its predecessor the [[Pz.III E|Pz.Kpfw. III]], was devised by Heinz Guderian, where he envisioned a support tank to be used to handle anti-tank guns and fortifications. The Panzer IV was to work alongside the more numerable Panzer III in Panzer Divisions (three company of IIIs and one of IVs) to engage the enemy, giving the role of fighting enemy armoured forces to the Panzer IIIs. As a support tank, the tank was to have the short 75 mm howitzer as its main armament and have a weight limit of 24 tons. MAN, Krupp, and Rheinmetall-Borsig worked on the development of the tanks, but the Krupp's model was selected for further testing.

The chosen model from Krupp, once finished, used a leaf-spring double-bogie system for its suspension, which was chosen instead of both a proposed interleaved suspension and the earlier devised torsion bar suspension system for the sake of faster production. The vehicle held five crew members, the commander, gunner, loader, radio operator (and hull machine gunner), and driver. Though it looked symmetrical, the Panzer IV turret was actually offset to the left of the chassis centre line a bit while the engine was also offset to the right, this was to allow the torque shaft to turn the turret. The offset also meant that most of the ammo is held on the right side of the tank in storage areas. The Panzer IV was then accepted into service and production began in 1936.

===Panzer IV Ausf. F1===
After the Battle of Poland and France, the deficiencies of the [[Pz.IV C|Ausf. C]] variant saw it being upgraded on October 1940 to the [[Pz.IV E|Ausf. E]]. Despite the new upgrades, the Panzer IV was upgraded again to refine its detail with the '''Panzer IV Ausf. F''' in April 1941.  Still retaining the KwK 37 L/24 75 mm howitzer gun, but with now a full 50 mm thick glacis plate and an increase of side armour to 30 mm. The tracks are also widened from 380 to 400 mm to balance the increased weight from the Ausf. C's 18 tons to the Ausf. F 22 tons.

The Ausf. F was the main Panzer IV variant during the start of Operation Barbarossa, but was soon found to be terribly outgunned by the appearance of the Soviet [[T-34 (1941)|T-34]] and [[KV-1 (L-11)|KV-1]] tanks. The short 75 mm howitzer was inadequate to deal with these new tanks at all. All was not lost though, as in the weeks before Barbarossa, a proposal was made to upgrade the Panzer IV with a new gun to increase its firepower, with the new 75 mm Pak 40 anti-tank gun. The resulting gun was the KwK 40 L/43 and up-gunned the Panzer IV Ausf. F. The Ausf. F was then renamed to '''F1''' for the variants retaining the shorter 75 mm howitzer, and [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV Ausf. F2]] for the variants with the more lethal 75 mm KwK 40 L/43 gun.

The Pz. IV Ausf. F tank was the result of analysis of previous variants' combat experience in Poland and France. The thickness of the front armour on the turret and hull was increased to 50 mm. The single-hinged hatches on the sides of the turret were replaced with double-hinged ones. The thickness and arrangement of viewports were modified. The front hull was straightened once again. The directional machine gun received a new Kugelblende 50 ball mount. The ammunition for the machine guns (both the gun paired with the cannon and the directional gun) was increased to 3,000 rounds. Since the hull's weight was 48% greater than that of the Ausf. E variant, the vehicle received new 400-mm-wide tank treads instead of the 360 mm treads used earlier. Additional ventilation holes were located in the roof of the engine compartment and in the covers over the transmission hatch. The design and placement of the engine and turret rotation motor were modified.

All of these improvements were intended to increase the safety of the crew and the usability and serviceability of the vehicle.

The Krupp-Gruson, Vomag, and Nibelungenwerke companies manufactured this tank from April 1941 to March 1942.

A total of 437 were produced. Beginning in April 1942, the tank was designated Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. F1, since it was the basis for the design of the Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. F2, which included a new 75 mm 7,5 cm KwK 40 gun with a long 43-caliber barrel.

Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. F1 vehicles fought in Africa, on all parts of the Eastern Front from 1941 to 1944, and in Operation Citadel.

This variant was supplied to Germany's allies: Hungary, Croatia, Turkey, and Spain. Captured Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. F tanks were eagerly used by the Red Army.
