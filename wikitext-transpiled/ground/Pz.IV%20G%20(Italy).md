== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]]. It differs from the German Pz.IV G by its longer gun, protection in the turret and its curved radio antenna.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The Pz.IV G has really great armour; due to it being well armoured, it can easily survive it being up tiered to rank III gameplay. This allows the Pz.IV G to perform a variety of playstyles, such as front-line assault, support, and as a flanker. Unlike the German version, this Italian variant removes the side-skirts but adds extra armour on the sides of the turret. The extra armour on the turret doesn't really help the vehicle too much in terms of protection, but it doesn't harm the vehicle by having it. Overall, the vehicle is good enough to survive encounters with formidable opponents, such as Shermans and T-34s.

==== Ammunition ====

- '''PzGr 39''' - Armour-Piercing Capped Ballistic Cap shell - Use this shell as your main ammunition type, as it has a good penetration power and deals the most damage upon penetration thanks to its explosive filler.
- '''Hl.Gr. 38B''' - High Explosive Anti-Tank shell - it is recommended to completely avoid this kind of shell as its performance is vastly inferior in all aspects compared to APCBC or APCR ammo used by this tank.
- '''PzGr 40''' - Armour-Piercing Composite Rigid shell - This type of ammo should be used when facing a heavily armoured enemy such as the Churchill VII and flanking is not an option. However, its post-penetration damage is much lower because it has no explosive filler to detonate after penetrating. Do not use the PzGr 40 against sloped armour as APCR shells have extremely poor performance against angled armour.
- '''SprGr. 34''' - High Explosive shell - Carry only very few of these. They are useless against anything other than unarmoured AA vehicles, to which it is lethal.
- '''K.Gr.Rot Nb.''' - Smoke shell - Pack a few of these. They are useful to blind enemy vehicles that block your advance while being being too remote for you to disable.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Italian Pz.IV G has a very similar playstyle as its German counterpart, the vehicle can work both as a sniper and brawler, thanks to its improved armour and great gun. One of the many upsides that you'll come to enjoy is the armour, which goes hand in hand with the brawler playstyle. As a brawler you'll usually be leading the charge for your team at the start of the match, this can be a very effective way to get easy eliminations if done right. Whilst leading the charge, it is essential that you maintain situational awareness at all times, as the un-sloped armour, while it can prove to be better than other counterparts of the vehicle, might not be sufficient to provide reliable defense in surprise encounters.

In terms of armaments, the Pz.IV G is armed with the KwK40 L/43, a great weapon which is able to deal with the majority of enemies it will face. The 75 mm KwK40 L/43 gun is still also good when up-tiered, and a monster when down-tiered. A solid hit on a target's front armour that's not sloped is very likely to penetrate.

When playing as a sniper, the gameplay is fairly simple, find a good spot on a map, angle your tank, and wait for incoming enemies to get in your line of sight. Depending on what rounds you choose to bring, you have usually a high chance to either destroy an enemy tank or seriously injure their crew, which will hopefully give you enough time to finish them off. Although you won't need to research the engine upgrade module for the Pz.IV G, keep in mind that the mobility of the vehicle is not the best, however adequate enough to get you to where you need to be at a good pace. One of the downsides of this vehicle is mainly that it will struggle at times to penetrate heavier foes, generally speaking most of them have weak spots you can take advantage of, in which case, situational awareness is vital.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Hard-hitting APCBC can easily knock out common foes
- High muzzle velocity and gun accuracy allow long range engagements
- Smoke charges deploy in 3 salvos, can conceal the tank 3 times
- Thick 80 mm frontal hull armour can neglect some shots when angling
- Satisfactory forward speed allows it to keep up with most teammates' advance
- Extra armoured skirt on the turret protects it from some HEAT and HE projectiles
- -10° gun depression is helpful when fighting in mountainous terrain

'''Cons:'''

- Cramped crew compartment means a penetration will incapacitate if not knock out your crew in one shot
- Poor frontal turret armour often gets penetrated in frontal engagements
- Side and rear armour is thin, making flanking shots more dangerous
- Large transmission on the lower front hull immobilises the tank once damaged
- Low mobility especially reverse speed and hull traverse

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The story of the Pz.IV G begins in Germany during the Second World War, the Pz.Kpfw.IV's creation, which, like its predecessor the [[Panzer III (Family)|Pz.Kpfw. III]], was devised by German engineer Heinz Guderian. He was one of the many German engineers who wanted to create an adequate support tank that had the dual role of being used to handle anti-tank guns and take out enemy fortifications. As a support tank, the Panzer IV was to have the short 75 mm howitzer as its main armament and also a weight limit of 24 tons. MAN, Krupp, and Rheinmetall-Borsig worked on the development of the tanks, but Krupp's model was selected for further testing. After a lot of testing, and refinement of the design, such as the addition of a leaf-spring double-bogie system for its suspension, instead of the planned torsion bar suspension system (mainly for the sake of faster production), the design went into production. Shortly after, German armoured regiments would start getting equipped with the tank, and once an adequate amount of the vehicle had been put in service, surplus vehicles would either be sold/given to other countries, or they'd be used as a base for later variants of the tank.
[[File:Pz.IV G (Div.M.) (2) .png|thumb|Pz.IV G (Div.M.) During Training]]
Eventually, once the vehicle had been used in active combat, some of its defects started to be revealed, mainly when facing Soviet armour, such as the T-34 and KV-1. It wasn't on par, and soon enough would see itself struggle. To amend this, the German engineers devised to upgrade the tank, mainly in its armament sector. The new tank would instead feature a much more powerful KwK40 L/43 gun, which was more than enough to deal with enemy armour at the time. The G variant also featured a stronger 80 mm thick front glacis armour with 30 mm side armour, which would really improve its overall survivability. Interestingly enough, German engineers would employ some weight-saving techniques, though even with these, the tank still weighed about 23.6 tons and put strain onto the driving system, a common issue surrounding many German vehicles at the time. Some simplification went into the tank such as the removal of the vision ports on the sides of the turret. Another armour upgrade would be the introduction of the ''Schürzen'' side armour side-skirts on the turret and hull sides.
[[File:Pz.IV G (Div.M.) (1) .png|thumb|Pz.IV G (Div.M.) During training]]
The Italian versions would remove this, as was the case for many Italian vehicles. In terms of the Italian story of this tank, Germany had supplied 12 units of the Panzer IV G to Italy during the late stages of the Second World War. They later joined the 1st Armored Division Black Shirts "M" (for "Mussolini"), which was established from May 1943, mainly starting from the very few survivors of the previous MVSN Battalions M who had been repatriated from the Russian front. The division was organised in 3 companies, which one of them comprising the Pz.IV G, they were slightly modified however, such as with the removal of the side-skirts and the introduction of additional armour placed around the turret. The Italian Pz.IV Gs would be painted in a light tan colour with the Divisione "M" logo usually painted on the turret. On 25 July 1943, they were transferred to the 136th Armored Division "Centauro II". They didn't see any action during the war, most of them were still undergoing training at the time and most, if not all of the tanks would end up in Allied hands shortly after the war.
