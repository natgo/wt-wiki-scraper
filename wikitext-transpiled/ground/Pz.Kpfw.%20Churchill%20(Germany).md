== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Churchill tank was an infantry tank produced by Great Britain intended for supporting an infantry assault with its armour and firepower. The Churchill tank's first action was during the disastrous Dieppe Raid in August 1942, which saw a number of them committed then lost when the Allies were unable to recover the tank during their retreat. The Germans captured these tanks and subjected them through evaluations. Their initial impressions were poor, thinking the Churchill tank as obsolete. The captured Churchills were repurposed within the Wehrmacht in roles such as ''Beutepanzers'' or shore fortifications.

Introduced in [[Update 1.55 "Royal Armour"]], the Pz.Kpfw. Churchill is a German captured [[Churchill Mk III]] that is distinguished by being painted grey (with the same tone as the Panzer IV and Panzer III) and possess white Wehrmacht markings. The Pz.Kpfw. Churchill is one of the best heavy tanks in rank III, sporting heavy frontal armour, a 6-pounder gun that is suitable for its rank, and 30 smoke grenades that are fired separately from the roof, great for covering great areas with smoke. The Churchill also has great gun depression and turret traverse, meaning it can fire at different targets very efficiently. However, the low acceleration and speed makes it a slug on the battlefield, making it difficult to manoeuvre and a large target against enemy guns. The thin roof armour also means that the tank is perfect prey to fighter-bombers and rocket attacks.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

There are very few enemies which can successfully penetrate the Churchill, although the [[M10 GMC|M10]] and the [[Achilles]] can quickly take care of this vehicle even at long ranges. Other tanks like the [[Jagdpanzer IV]], the [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)]], and the [[Dicker Max]] can also make quick work of the Churchill, but only in arcade battles, as in realistic battles, they all belong in the same tree.

Like its British counterpart, the Churchill can be used as a very efficient brawler with its excellent turret traverse and gun depression, and heavy frontal armour. Though in urban environments, you should be careful in case someone tries to flank your weak side and rear armour.

This tank can be effectively be played in a brawling style, going into the front lines. This tank, due to its excellent armour and gun, can even hold off an entire enemy flank with minimal backup. In city maps, be careful not to expose your side armour as it is quite weak and your engine might get damaged. With its good gun, it can be as a support tank as well, in the second line destroying tanks. Angle your armour to maximize its effectiveness. When frontally angled, even the sides will be tough to penetrate. Many tanks will struggle penetrating you. There are some tanks that you don't even need to worry at all penetrating you from the front, such as the Panzer III. Angling your armour will make you even tough against the high penetration Panzer IV F2. However, be aware of higher penetration tanks. The M10 is a worthy mention as most of the time it might be able to penetrate your armour. The far deadlier Achilles can penetrate your front with little effort. Thus, it is advised to take cover, angle, or destroy them first. Shermans are not much threat since they won't really penetrate your armour, but sometimes they do. They are easy to deal with as your 57 mm gun can punch straight through. Your 57 oddly does a lot of damage for a 57 mm gun. It can one shot Panzer III's, and sometimes Shermans if you aim correctly. Overall, the Churchill III is a very powerful Rank III vehicle that is capable of holding off an entire flank, while destroying tanks easily in quick succession.

If you are not in an up-tiered situation, you can effectively enter a battle and absorb all the enemy rounds which could've been fired at your weaker teammates and either engage the enemy with your 57 mm cannon or let your teammates return fire. Companion vehicles such as the [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV F2]], [[8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl.]] and other German vehicles possess superior firepower compared to the other country vehicles in rank III (Except for other special TDs, such as the American [[M10 GMC]] and British [[Achilles]]) and can in most cases hold their own.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Long, tough hull is easily angled
* 90 mm turret armour is effective at medium & long range
* Large tracks can absorb shells fired at the side
* Fast turret traverse, easy to engage people without turning
* 57 mm gun reloads quickly
* Good penetration
* Slow speed makes it easy to hit enemies after a shortstop
* 30 individually fired smoke grenades, great for covering points and areas with smoke
* Good gun depression
* Has access to a low-speed stabilizer for firing on the move, pairs well with the vehicle's slow speed

'''Cons:'''

* No HE filler for any rounds, unless hitting an ammo rack, it will require multiple shots to take the target down
* Large target, easily spotted by bombers/fighter-bombers
* Very poor speed, both forward and backward
* Unangled armour fares poorly at close ranges
* Lack of camouflage, only urban grey and winter livery
* Machine gun port is only 50 mm
* Roof armour is very thin, can be penetrated by .50 cal rounds
* Engine mostly affected when hit from the side or turret
* Large tracks are vulnerable to damage

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The German military first encountered the [[Churchill (Family)|Churchill]] tank in August of 1942, following the disastrous Dieppe raid made by British and Canadian military elements. On August 8th, the Churchill Mk IV made its debut, as almost 60 of them had been allocated to assist the 6,000 British and Canadian troops raiding the beach. Of those, only the first 30 were deployed, and of those 30, one became trapped in its damaged landing craft, another two sank, and 11 were disabled by indirect fire and rough terrain. Despite the losses, this was the first successful use of heavy tanks in amphibious landings. In the chaotic evacuation that followed, the tanks that had deployed and survived the raid were unable to be recovered by the British and were abandoned. They, along with many other examples of British equipment, were captured by the Germans.

These tanks were later evaluated by the Germans. Though none were damaged by direct anti-tank fire, the Germans had come to the conclusion that the tanks were virtually obsolete, too underpowered and lacking proper firepower. Two of the twenty-nine tanks captured at Dieppe were used as ''Beutepanzers'' and saw service with the German military, repainted into the German standard grey colouration and marked with prominent Iron Crosses on the sides of the turret. The rest of the captured Churchills were repurposed for secondary combat roles, destroyed, or taken apart, with their turrets being used as improvised beach defences at Dieppe after the raid.
