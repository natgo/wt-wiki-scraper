== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The capitulation of France in 1940 saw a number of equipment captured by the Germans, including the [[AMD.35]] armoured car and their production facilities. The German Wehrmacht pressed the Panhard armoured car into service, issuing them to their reconnaissance units and they would see prominent use during Operation Barbarossa. However, as the years pass, the AMD.35 were seen as becoming obsolete in the frontline services and saw more use behind the lines such as occupational and policing duties. In 1944, it was decided to take 34 AMD.35 and modify them to accommodate the [[KwK_L/42_(50_mm)|50 mm L/42 tank gun]] used in the Panzer III. Transformed into open-top vehicles and designated as Pz.Sp.Wg.P204(f) KwK, the were utilized in occupation duties until the Allied invasion of Normandy, where the vehicles were then committed to combat the invading Allies.

Introduced as part of a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8384-event-summer-extreme-en|2023 Summer Extreme]] event during [[Update "La Royale"]], the Pz.Sp.Wg.P204(f) KwK is a fairly unique armoured car in the early German tech tree line-up. The AMD.35 armoured car chassis provides decent mobility on hard surfaces, but the star of the show is the 50 mm cannon, which is powerful enough to penetrate tanks it will encounter. However, limitations in the turret traverse and the open-top nature of the turret limits the full potential of this cannon at the rank it is in. The Pz.Sp.Wg.P204(f) KwK can help players strike true with power, but only in the right situations that the player can put the armoured car into against an incoming enemy.

=== Mobility ===

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
As a wheeled vehicle, the Pz.Sp.Wg.P204(f) KwK is fast and has a good mobility on hard surfaces. However, it bleeds energy and loses a lot of mobility when offroad.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

With a lack of a coaxial machine gun and poor armor, players may find head on attacks against enemies difficult. Instead utilization of their speed and powerful cannon will be their main objective. Flank attacks and supporting fire for teammates are highly recommended. The high agility of the vehicle also allows for the capture of objectives quickly and efficiently while being able to avoid enemies. However a lack of ammunition does force the player to select their shots carefully as one too many missed or wasted shots can result in a quick return to the hanger. With the lack of a roof and armor in the rear it's highly recommended to always be facing the enemy. Despite being weak, the armor of the turret prevents mostly machine gun fire from harming the loader and gunner. The protection of these two members can be the factor between losing the vehicle or being able to limp back to a control point.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Wheeled vehicle, faster than conventional tanks on roads
* Powerful 50 mm KwK L/42 cannon can penetrate most vehicles at its BR 
* Special transmission allows for top speed to be reached in both forward and reverse, making engine-first tactics viable and increasing survivability 

'''Cons:'''

* Poor braking
* Large turning radius
* Lack of coaxial machine gun
* Relies on player's ability to hit shots on key crew members (drivers and gunners) 
* Open-topped layout makes it prone to air attack and flanking machine gun attacks
* Weak armour stops only rifle-calibre machine gun rounds
* Poor manoeuvrability off road, confines the vehicle to surfaces like roads and gravel for utilization of speed advantage
