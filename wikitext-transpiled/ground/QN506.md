== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Guide Military QN506, officially nicknamed as the "New King of Ground Battle" (新陆战之王)  during 2018 Zhuhai Airshow, is a defense product based on ZTZ59's chassis with a new 30 mm turret systems and missile systems, as well as sporting the latest TVD cameras for the crews of the vehicle; marketed as a competitor of Russian's BMPT and aimed for urban battles/counter-guerrilla operations, the vehicle has yet to secure orders from overseas customers.

Introduced as one of the main prize of the "Repair Factory" event, the vehicle becomes the very first one to introduce fire-and-forget missiles for ground vehicles a. While the protection and mobility is mostly identical to a ZTZ59 which its chassis is based on, the more than 20 guided munitions and its 30 mm cannon will certainly make both aerial and ground targets having a very bad day.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Looking at the chassis itself, it looks very similar to ZTZ59D1 with its FY-2 ERA; this is indeed true as QN506 is based on ZTZ59's chassis with additional ERA and side rubber skirts. To fit the new combat compartment, QN506 heighten the compartment with an additional 30mm plates; as well as sporting a ZPT99G turret at the center of the hull. Unlike what most players would have expected, the combat compartment is isolated from the crew compartment (that is, the turret is unmanned), so any shots on the turret will very likely disable the guns or the turret system altogether but the crew is very likely left unharmed. Since they are now placed at the front in a tandem configuration (with the driver slightly offset from the remaining crews), any shots for the center mass will likely taking out the crews right away, knocking the vehicle out right away.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
Although it is very likely later 12V150 series engines could be fitted onto the vehicle, QN506 retained the original 12V150L which is identical to ZTZ59s; most tanks at its tier has at least 800 hp which also means QN506 will not be the first one to reach the frontline and making it challenging to flanking enemies for greater odds to defeat them.

Mainland China introduced 2A72 alongside with the turret of BMP-3 in 1993 and the reverse-engineer was completed by late 1990s, the standalone gun is named ZPZ02 while the lightweight turret housing this gun is named ZPT99 instead, a special case among the PLA naming conventions. Unlike its Russian counterpart, NORINCO developed APFSDS (or APDS-FS in this case) for the gun, giving more options and better odds to penetrating enemy targets.

The 20 smaller tubes on the launcher is the laser-guided QN201DD missile; marketed as an "multipurpose economical missile" by Guide Infrared, it might not have the penetration to handle MBTs at its tier with ERA or composite armor, but 20 of them is more than enough to take out light vehicles straight away or MBTs by flanking them.

The 4 larger tubes on the missile launcher box housed the fire-and-forget QN502CDD missiles; it is also the first FnF missile for ground vehicles in-game, not only its 1000 mm penetration can make sure enemy ground vehicles be hit behind covers thanks to its unique trajectory, the missile can also lock onto aerial targets from some distance- the missile will very likely taking them out if the target is unaware of the missile flying straight to him.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list.

Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* First ground vehicle to introduce FnF missiles with very high penetration and range
* 20 shots of beam-riding missiles for taking out enemy targets from sides
* High-definition TVD cameras and retractable CITV
* Opto-electronic tracker for taking out aerial targets
* Sufficiently fast turret traverse speed

*

'''Cons:'''

* Rather low mobility at its tier
* Insufficient protection against common rounds at its tier
* Relatively huge as a "light tank"
* QN201DD has insufficient penetration for targets with composite armor/ERA
* Low RoF for the autocannon

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The story of how an opto-electronical equipment manufacturer entered arms trade sector (the first listed private-sector company to do so) would have to trace back to Huang Li (黄立; wealthiest person in Hubei and founder of Guide Infrared), who quit his position from Hubei Electricity Experiment Institute (湖北省电力试验研究所) in 1999 and established Guide Infrared with his savings just a year before. His company was quite involved in the SARS pandemic for the drastic rose on the demand of thermometer; although he found French thermal sensors very effective, as the US sanctions for such sensors to Mainland China issued in 2008, the company invested billions of CNY to develop domestic thermal sensors and the company overcame this challenge by late-2010s. Meanwhile, Guide Infrared also earned the certificate to research and manufacture ordnances in 2014 and established a missile institute in 2017; they also acquired a factory with non-lethal munition product line and started to research on complete weapon systems. <ref>https://user.guancha.cn/main/content?id=834173</ref>

During the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow, there was an uncommon product by at the Guide Military's (subsidy of Wuhan Guide Infrared 武汉高德红外股份有限公司) showroom- a vehicle with 24 visible missiles onboard and sporting a 30 mm autocannon on a ZTZ59 chassis. As the visitors took a closer look to this vehicle, the name "QN506" and "New King of Ground Battle" (新陆战之王) came into the eyes of observers.
