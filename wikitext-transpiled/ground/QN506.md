== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''QN506''', officially nicknamed the "New King of Land Warfare" (新陆战之王) during the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow, is a defense product based on the [[ZTZ59 (Family)|ZTZ59]]'s chassis with a new 30 mm turret system and missile systems, as well as sporting the latest TVD cameras for the crews of the vehicle. Marketed as a competitor for the Russian BMPT and aimed for urban battles/counter-guerrilla operations, the vehicle has yet to secure orders from overseas customers.

Introduced during [[Update "Sky Guardians"]] as one of the main rewards for the [[wt:en/news/8186-event-repair-factory-en|"Repair Factory" event]], the QN506 is the first to introduce fire-and-forget missiles for ground vehicles. While the protection and mobility are mostly identical to the ZTZ59 which its chassis is based on, the 24 guided munitions and 30 mm cannon can certainly make both aerial and ground targets have a very bad day.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The QN506 is based on the chassis of the [[ZTZ59 (Family)|ZTZ59]] with additional ERA and rubber side skirts. To fit the new combat compartment, the QN506 has a heightened compartment with additional 30 mm plates, as well as sporting a ZPT99G turret in the center of the hull. Unlike what most players would have expected, the combat compartment is isolated from the crew compartment (that is, the turret is unmanned), so any shots on the turret will very likely disable the guns or the turret system altogether but the crew is very likely left unharmed. Since they are now placed at the front in a tandem configuration (with the driver slightly offset from the remaining crew), any shots for the centre mass will likely knock the vehicle out right away.

The flat frontal plate and the fragile unmanned turret are huge weak spots that can get penetrated by autocannons and disable QN506 to fight back. The ERAs on the upper glacis could help QN506 survive a few shots from HEATFS, yet it's still far from capable to stop any tandem ATGM or large-calibre APFSDS around its BR from killing the whole crew. The ATGM launchers mounted on each side of its unmanned turret are vulnerable to overpressure damage. Sometimes, a dozen of rounds from autocannon could detonate those launchers and knock out the whole crew.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)
* High hardness rolled armour (additional armour plates, missile racks)
* ERA (hull front)
* Rubber-fabric screens (side skirts)
* Structural steel (Slat armour)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The QN506 retains the 12V150L engine identical to the [[ZTZ59 (Family)|ZTZ59]]s; most tanks at its rank have at least 800 hp which also means QN506 will not be the first one to reach the frontline and makes it challenging to flank enemies effectively.

{{main|ZPZ02 (30 mm)}}

China introduced the 2A72 alongside the turret of the BMP-3 in 1993, and reverse-engineering was completed by the late 1990s. The standalone gun was named ZPZ02 while the lightweight turret housing this gun is named ZPT99 instead, a special case among PLA naming conventions. Unlike its Russian counterpart, NORINCO developed APFSDS for the gun, giving more options and better odds of penetrating enemy targets.

The QN506 can only bring 2 belts of ammo in total into the battle. Each belt contains 100 rounds, and the ammo type of those two must be different (except the default one). These features force players to conserve their ammo and use it wisely.

Unfortunately, half the rounds in this belt are pretty useless against both tanks and planes, while the 30 mm HEF-I doesn't have proximity fuse. It is suggested to research other more useful ammo as soon as possible.

* '''30 mm HE:''' {{Annotation|HEF-I*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|APDS|Armour-piercing discarding sabot}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-I*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEF-I*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary (self-destroying)}} - This ammo type focuses on AA role as it contains more HEF-I compared to the default one. However, the absence of proximity fuse and relatively low amount of projectile density decrease its performance.

* '''30 mm APDS:''' {{Annotation|APDS|Armour-piercing discarding sabot}}{{-}}{{Annotation|APDS|Armour-piercing discarding sabot}}{{-}}{{Annotation|APDS|Armour-piercing discarding sabot}}{{-}}{{Annotation|APDS|Armour-piercing discarding sabot}} - This one is a full APDS belt which may do decent damage against lightly-armoured vehicles. However, its performance dramatically decreases by sloped armour and the enemy's angling tactic. Hence, you have to aim at the flat side of the enemy MBTs or it won't do much damage.

This belt has around 100 mm of penetration at point blank and can go through the side armour of most vehicles it may confront. Note that most MBTs around this BR still have sufficient thickness of lower glacis armour to stop the rounds. Aim at the breech and barrel of enemy MBTs when you can't catch their sides.

{{main|QN201DD}}

The 20 smaller tubes on the launcher are laser-guided QN201DD missiles. This armament is considered the secondary gun of the QN506. Marketed as a "multipurpose economical missile" by Guide Infrared, it might not have the penetration to handle MBTs at its rank with ERA or composite armour, but 20 of them are more than enough to take out light vehicles straight away or MBTs from the sides or sometimes the lower glacis. Awkwardly, the QN201DD can be disrupted by IRCM, so you might have to destroy the enemy IRCM with your autocannon before launching QN201DDs.

Besides the anti-tank role, this ATGM is also capable to act as a makeshift surface-to-air missile. It has a 4 km of effective firing range and 450 m/s of peak speed. Unlike SACLOS missiles, the QN201DD has an acceptable turning rate and flies very stably. With the tracking radar and proper guidance, it may get a direct hit on careless helicopters and jets. Still, it's not an orthodox SAM which usually has a proximity fuse or decent maximum overload. You cannot guide multiple QN201DDs at once or launch it on the move, either.

{{main|QN502CDD}}

The 4 larger tubes on the missile launcher box house the fire-and-forget QN502CDD missiles with a tandem warhead. This armament is considered the special gun of the QN506. QN502CDD is a fire-and-forget missile with lock-on before launch and automatic self-guidance. It takes a top attack flight profile against the target with some distance and will fly directly toward the nearby one. Not only can their 1,000 mm penetration easily destroy enemy ground vehicles hit behind cover thanks to its unique trajectory, but the missile can also lock onto aerial targets from some distance - the missile will very likely take them out if the target is unaware of the missile flying straight to them. Unlike the ordinary IF missile, the QN502CDD is quite resistant to flares and HIRSS. It can also lock the aircraft in instant within 8 km of effective range without triggering MAW.

Despite its brilliant firepower, the QN502CDD is quite challenging to use in practice. The awful -5° depression angle dramatically limits its usage as an ATGM carrier. It requires more than half the body of the enemy vehicle exposed in your gunner's sight to get a successful lock, which is rare in most situations. It also has a slow peak speed of 205 m/s and mediocre tracking that most enemy helicopters with proper vigilance can easily evade with a roll. Besides, since you cannot decide which place the missile should hit, you might have to spam them when you accidentally have a close-quarters battle with the enemy MBTs and pray they will hit the right spot and neutralize your enemy.

When fighting in hilly maps, it's suggested that you should rise your gun a bit before launching the QN502CDD, or it might crash into obstacles before its climbing stage. The lock will remain as it is inside a 90° arc from your gun sight.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|Type 86 (7.62 mm)}}

The 7.62 mm MG is only effective against light vehicles with open compartments. It takes an awkward position since every else armament on this vehicle can do a better job than it from all aspects, so it will only be useful when you want to conserve your valuable ammo. It can still be used to ping targets or to destroy minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

=== Radar ===
As a light tank, the QN506 uses an electro-optical targeting system to help it fight aerial targets. This equipment won't trigger the LWS of the locked hostile aircraft, increasing the anti-air capability of the QN506 to both guide the QN201DD and fire your autocannon with accurate leading. However, you still have to manually find aerial targets due to the absence of a search radar.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
As a Chinese light tank, the QN506 carries many lethal weapons to use in battles. The QN506 is a great predator to slay light vehicles and helicopters. However, you're also very vulnerable to enemy firepower due to your fragile turret and volatile ATGM launchers. Besides, the QN506 lacks any efficient measure to kill a MBT from the front except for its uncontrollable QN502CDD missiles. Far from the expectation of many players, the QN506 doesn't have advantage in hilly maps. The top-attacking QN502CDD can't lock the enemy with a tiny part of the vehicle exposed. The underperforming engine and mediocre depression also limit its capability to flank and manoeuvre across the maps.

With the electro-optical targeting system, the QN506 is capable to shoot down helicopters and careless jets with its powerful weapons. However, all of its armaments lack proximity fuse to be a professional SPAA. On occasion, you may use QN502CDD to hunt helicopters when they sneak attack your team and immediately hide behind hills.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 4 fire-and-forget IR missiles have high penetration (1000mm) and long range
* 20 beam-riding missiles for taking out enemy targets from the sides
* High-definition TVD cameras and retractable CITV
* Opto-electronic tracker for taking out aerial targets
* Sufficiently fast turret traverse speed

'''Cons:'''

* Rather low mobility as a light tank at its rank
* Insufficient protection against common rounds at its rank
* Relatively huge as a "light tank"
* QN201DD has insufficient penetration for targets with composite armour/ERA
* Low RoF for the autocannon
* Slow -7km/h reverse speed and poor -5° gun depression

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The story of how an opto-electronical equipment manufacturer entered the arms trade sector (the first listed private-sector company to do so) traces back to Huang Li (黄立), who quit his position from Hubei Electricity Experiment Institute (湖北省电力试验研究所) in 1999 and had established Guide Infrared with his savings less than a year before. His company was quite involved in the SARS pandemic due to the dramatic rise in demand of thermometers: although he found French thermal sensors very effective, US sanctions on such sensors to Mainland China were issued in 2008, so the company invested billions of CNY to develop domestic thermal sensors and the company overcame this challenge by the late-2010s. Meanwhile, Guide Infrared also earned the certificate to research and manufacture ordnance in 2014 and established a missile institute in 2017; they also acquired a factory with non-lethal munition product line and started research on complete weapon systems. <ref>https://user.guancha.cn/main/content?id=834173</ref>

During the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow, there was an uncommon product in the Guide Military (subsidy of Wuhan Guide Infrared 武汉高德红外股份有限公司) showroom - a vehicle with 24 visible missiles onboard and sporting a 30 mm autocannon on a ZTZ59 chassis. As the visitors took a closer look to this vehicle, the name "QN506" and "New King of Land Warfare" (新陆战之王) came into the eyes of observers.
