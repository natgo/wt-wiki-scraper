== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 "Supersonic"]].

* The belly is 15 mm thick.

The {{PAGENAME}} has light armour able to protect it against .50 cal heavy machine guns from the front and low calibre machine guns from the sides. Any autocannon or tank cannon is however able to shred easily through this armour. The R3 has an internal layout with the crew spread apart, allowing it to survive damage from non-explosive post-penetration damage. However, this tank is still very vulnerable to strafing aircraft. Bombs and rockets also deal heavy damage if the {{PAGENAME}} is standing in their destruction radius.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 135|rbMinHp= 84}}

The {{PAGENAME}} is very mobile, able to outmanoeuvre most tanks of its rank and is reliant on this to stay alive.

The 20 mm Oerlikon cannon is able to fight both aircraft and lightly armoured targets from the front.

Upgraded, the gun has access to 20 mm rounds able to penetrate up to 57 mm of armour, enabling the tank to shred any tanks that expose their sides to this vehicle. Some heavier tanks are still too heavily armoured on the sides for the gun to penetrate, but these generally don't show up unless you are up-tiered.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}} - The standard belt that can fulfill both roles (anti-air and lightly armoured vehicles) but with a lower rate of fire.
* '''M594:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}} - This belt is adapted for targeting aircraft with its high-explosive shells.

'''Notes''':

* Ammunition is modeled as 5 belts of 120 rounds each.
* As the rate of fire is very high, pack the maximum ammunition.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The R3 is designated as an SPAA, and performs in this role extremely effectively. The autocannon has a rapid rate of fire and high velocity, allowing the R3 to tear aircraft to shreds. With accurate fire, a short burst will obliterate most aircraft in very little time. When the skies are clear and there are no more planes to shoot down, the R3 becomes a highly flexible vehicle, being able to zip around the map at high speed performing various tasks. Early game it makes an excellent reconnaissance vehicle, being able to capture points, oversee the battlefield and destroy enemy vehicles.

With over 50 mm of penetration and its exceptional speed, the R3 makes short work of British and American medium tanks from the side and will shred light tanks and other SPAA. The R3 does not have the penetration to handle well-armoured tanks, so tanks like the KV-1 and M4A5 should be avoided. When encountering an armoured vehicle: take out the gun barrel first, then tracks, and aim at the turret ring.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful main armament.
** M601 HVAP-T round has over 50 mm of penetration, enough to penetrate many vehicles up close.
** High muzzle velocity, requiring little lead and little shell drop for engaging targets at range.
** Very high rate of fire.
* Nimble enough to run circles around most armoured vehicles.
** Able to reach 100 km/h on roads with ease.
** Fast enough to reach over 50 km/h off-road.
* Front plate has armour thickness sufficient to deflect most machine gun rounds.
* Has a two-plane stabilizer.
** Completely negates recoil within effective speed/while stationary.
* Amphibious.

'''Cons:'''

* Very little armour.
* As with many wheeled vehicles, soft terrain massively slows it down.
* Hard collisions can damage modules and injure or incapacitate the crew.
* The gun only elevates up to 60° degrees.
* Stabilizer only effective up to 25 km/h.
* The vehicle tends to flip on its side when making sharp turns at high speed.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The '''OTO Melara R3 Capraia''' was a light reconnaissance vehicle which was developed as a private venture by OTO Melara of Italy. Derived from OTO Melara's R2.5 ''Gorgona'' armoured policing vehicle, the R3 ''Capraia'' was first presented at the 1982 Italian Naval Exhibition held in Genoa. The R3 shared its automotive parts with the R2.5, but had a body consisting of angled aluminium armour with in places a maximum thickness of 32 mm, providing enough protection against 7.62 mm NATO small arms fire and shell splinters.

A number of armament options were proposed by OTO Melara. These included:

* the R3 T12.7 FA, armed with an externally mounted 12.7 mm M2 HB machine gun in a turret with full 360° traverse and a maximum elevation of -10° to +50°;
* the R3 T7.65 FA, armed with an externally mounted 7.65 mm machine gun in a turret with full 360° traverse and a maximum elevation of -10° to +25°;
* the R3 T20 FA-HS, armed with an externally mounted Oerlikon KAD-B17 20 mm cannon in a turret with full 360° traverse and a maximum elevation of -10° to +60°;
* the R3 Folgore ×2 FA, armed with two externally mounted Breda Folgore anti-tank missiles and a secondary 7.65 mm machine gun;
* the [[R3 T106 FA]], armed with two externally mounted 106 mm M40 type recoilless rifles; and
* the R3 TOW, armed with an externally mounted launcher for a Hughes TOW ATGM system.

However, despite its high performance and the possibility of using various weapons, the Italian military did not express any interest in the OTO Melara R3 Capraia. Following the conclusion of its evaluation by the military, the R3 prototypes were disposed of.
