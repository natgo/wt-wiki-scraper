<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
In the 1990s, during the war in Southern Lebanon, Merkava Mk.3 tanks of the armoured reconnaissance squadron "Nakhshol" of the 71st battalion of the 188th Armoured Brigade of the Israel Defence Forces, were tested with an experimental electro-optical active protection system codenamed '''"Ra'am Segol"''' ("Purple Thunder") in combat conditions. The system detected the launch of an ATGM, alerted the crew, turned the gun towards the threat and deployed an aerosol screen using standard and additional smoke grenade launchers. The Ra'am Segol APS did not go into serial production, giving way to the more advanced [[Merkava Mk.4M|"Trophy" APS]].

The '''Ra'am Segol''' was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]]. In the game, its APS informs the commander of the direction from which the tank is being illuminated by an ATGM launch system, and the player can then make their own decision about manoeuvring and firing smoke. In all other respects, the tank is identical to its other counterparts, possessing the familiar 120 mm gun capable of penetrating most tanks, and decent turret protection. It is not the best in mobility compared to other tanks, and the front-mounted engine, while allowing it to withstand hits to the frontal part of the hull, increases the risk of engine failure and fire.

The Raam Segol is a Merkava Mk.3, and plays similarly to them.

The very powerful M322 APFSDS round will give you great advantages at long ranges, capable of penetrating any tank in the game, though in up-tiers you will have to aim for weak-spots on tanks such as the T-80BVM. The round can consistently one shot enemy tanks even with poor placement due to good spalling and penetration.

The M339 HE-TF round is great against hovering helicopters due to the time fuse and can also be used to overpressure tanks provided that you aim in the correct spots. Aiming at an enemy's wheels will cause the M339 to detonate directly under the enemy tank and knock out their entire crew. Bring 3-5 of these HE-TF shells for light tanks or hovering helicopters.

The very distinctive turret on the Merkava's allows the enemy to instantly know where to aim for your weak-spots. This can be mitigated by placing some bushes to conceal the look of your turret. If properly done it greatly increases the survivability as the enemies first shots will be against the weak spots of the more popular Abrams, Leopard, or Chieftain which tend to be your strong spots. Allowing you to punish anyone who mistakes you for another tank. Combine this with the low position of the crew inside the hull, and it makes positions where only your turret is visible very rewarding.

You have more smokes than you ever need, while the smokes on the side of the turret can be fired as quickly as you want, the mortar smoke that launches directly forward takes a few seconds to reload. This is not an issue unless you have expended over 30 of your smokes and the ones from the turret now shoot to your sides, which will leave your front vulnerable if the launcher is reloading.

Gen 1 thermals have massive disadvantages due to the fuzzy-ness of the optics compared to similar tanks at your BR. But the APFSDS round more than makes up for the poor aim you will have in long range thermals.

The commander sight does not get thermals and only gets night vision. In up-tiers this can be a drawback.

You will be the last to get into position majority of the time, this requires you to be a little more cautious but the good gun depression and very strong cannon allow you punish from range.

Engine smoke is very useful in down-tiers where most tanks do not have thermals to look though it.

The Raam Segol is not a brawler, and will lose most fights that require quick reloads or fast speed for positioning. This tank excels at long ranges where it can use its M322 round to its advantage. The uniqueness and rarity of the tank can be advantageous as some players will not know where to aim. But veteran players will tend to always 1 shot you. Avoid exposing your hull as that is your weak-spot to APFSDS.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Extremely large amount of smoke grenades, practically infinite for most battles
* Strong APFSDS shells, with great velocity and penetration
* Unique HE-TF that can be used as a pseudo-SAP round
* Good crew survivability
* Well-protected against IFV autocannons and HEAT rounds

'''Cons:'''

* Poor KE protection overall, weak turret cheeks and little meaningful hull armor
* Vulnerable engine and transmission due to frontal placement
* Rear-mounted turret can make it hard to fight around corners
* No thermals for the commander sight

In 2020, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) authorized the declassification of a unique tank unit -- long-since disbanded -- which had been used to test Israel's first Active Protection System.

The declassified tank unit operated in Israel's "Security Zone" in southern Lebanon, between around 1998 and Israel's eventual withdrawal in 2000. It was a company of [[Merkava Mk.3C|Merkava Mk.3]] tanks belonging to the IDF's 188th Armored Regiment -- at the time some of the most advanced Merkava tanks in service -- and mostly carried out patrols and ambushes against Hezbollah guerillas. Unlike other Israeli tanks at the time, however, the unit's tanks carried a unique new system known only by the code-name ''Ra'am Segol'' ("Purple Thunder"). The few existing photographs of the company's tanks from that period show the system as a pair of opaque boxes on the turret's forward cheeks, and an additional box at the rear of the turret. The system has never been showcased publicly, nor have any of its specifications been made clear; though the declassification of the armored company that utilized it has led to a somewhat solid conclusion about its intended function.

''Ra'am Segol'' is speculated to be a "soft-kill" APS: a radar/laser warning system that could detect incoming missiles, then perform some sort of reaction to neutralize them and/or reduce threat to the tank. ''Ra'am Segol'' could not intercept the incoming missile directly, instead performing electro-optical jamming (similar to the Russian Shtora-1, found on the [[T-90A]]) against SACLOS-guided missiles such as the TOW and MILAN, deflecting the missile's trajectory away from the tank. Additionally, it seems likely that the system would automatically deploy the Merkava's smoke grenades, and may have also automatically rotated the turret to face the incoming projectile and allow quick return-fire against the launcher.

In newspaper interviews following the declassification, crews from the ''Ra'am Segol'' unit reported exposing their tanks deliberately to potential threats in order to test the system directly, sometimes going out on patrols without any infantry support (very unusual for armored units during that particular conflict) or even stopping the tank at exposed positions in order to draw missile fire. Official IDF Armored Corps sources, however, have so far denied that the tanks had been utilized any differently from any other unit. There have been no reports of the system ever triggering in action, though the crews have reported never coming under any missile attacks, despite their deliberate efforts.

The ''Ra'am Segol'' unit was disbanded once the IDF withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, and the APS itself was dismantled from all of the tanks, never to be seen again. It is unknown whether the system had failed in some way, or was simply deemed unsuitable for the IDF's purposes. Nevertheless, just over a decade later, another Active Protection System was revealed in active service with the IDF, this time being the world's first "hard-kill" APS: the "[[Merkava Mk.4M|Trophy]]".
