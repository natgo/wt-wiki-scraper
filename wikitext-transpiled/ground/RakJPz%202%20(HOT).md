== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.63 "Desert Hunters"]]. Compared to its [[RakJPz 2|predecessor]], this variant has an upgraded missile known as the '''HOT''' ('''H'''igh Subsonic '''O'''ptical Remote-Guided, '''T'''ube-Launched) that is aimed by simply sticking the gun's sight onto the desired target.

Due to its relatively low profile, the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 HOT is able to completely conceal itself behind hills and rocks and fire over them. This allows for quick hit and run strikes, and ambushes are made much easier. According to several commanders, the reverse rate of this vehicle is outstanding, allowing retreat if needed. The ATGM itself is rather glitchy in long-range flight but is outstanding in mid to close range engagements. However, it cannot fire directly in front of it, nor does the ATGM perform well in vertical manoeuvring.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The RakJPz 2 (HOT) is a very deadly vehicle if played correctly. The vehicle is extremely lightly armoured and has to be mainly played in defensive positions. The location of the launcher and sight give it the ability to hide the hull of the vehicle and only expose the launcher keeping you protected while still being able to destroy oncoming enemies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Low profile
* Good horizontal control of the ATGM
* Amazing penetration
* Fast and manoeuvrable
* HOT missile can penetrate Rank VI special armour
* Armor can whitstand machine gun and small caliber autocannon fire

'''Cons:'''

* Poor vertical control of the ATGM
* If flanked, cannot return fire easily
* Fires up initially, preventing the tank from firing directly in front of it
* Due to the offset between the gunners sight and the missile launcher, missiles shot at close targets will be offset to the left.
* Missile launcher has limited traverse, requiring to turn the entire vehicle or make the missile turn sharply
* Can't fire missiles on the move

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
{{main|Raketenjagdpanzer 2 (History)}}

===Development===
In the 1960s, development of a missile carrier acting as a tank destroyer. The result came in 1961 with the ''Raketenjagdpanzer 1'', which features the French SS.11 anti-tank missile. The Raketenjagdpanzer 1 features two mounts for the missiles, but only one is available at a time as while one remains ready to fire, the other is reloading inside the vehicle. The vehicle can hold 10 missiles inside on a Hispano-Suiza HS-30 chassis. The vehicle carried lots of problems with the HS-30 chassis so only a limited amount was made at only 95 vehicles produced from 1961 to 1962. A second version was produced alongside the [[JPz 4-5|Jagdpanzer 4-5]] between 1963 and 1965, and the two were designed on the same chassis. The finished model was designated the ''[[RakJPz 2|Raketenjagdpanzer 2]]'' and this was accepted into service in 1967 for the German Bundeswehr. The Raketenjagdpanzer 2 was produced from 1967 to 1968 with a total of 318 units produced.

===Design===
Though slightly larger than the Raketenjagdpanzer 1, the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 had better automotive performances with a newer chassis and using a 500 hp diesel engine and a torsion bar suspension. The new vehicle chassis design allowed for increased missile storage for 14 SS.11 missiles. The Raketenjagdpanzer 2 features two rails for the missiles, both ready to fire and reloads are done automatically by each mount inside the vehicle. The SS.11 missiles allow the vehicle to engage enemy armour up to 3 kilometres away, with the missiles strong enough to take out most Soviet armour at the time. MG3 machine guns were added onto the vehicle for anti-infantry and anti-aircraft defence purposes.

===Usage===
The German Bundeswehr used the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 from 1967 as far as to the early 2000s. The Raketenjagdpanzer 2's purpose was to engage enemy armour in the ranges between 1.5 to 3 kilometres away, which tank armaments accuracy and power are reduced at the distances. The SS.11 missile's range and lethality made the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 perfect for its role as it could defeat the main Soviet tanks such as the [[T-54 (1951)|T-54/55]] and [[T-62]]. The Germans organized the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 in tank destroyer companies attached to Panzergrenadier brigades and Panzer brigades, with eight vehicles per company in the Panzergrenadier brigades and 13 vehicles per company in the Panzer brigades. When the manual-guided SS.11 missiles became obsolete, the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 underwent an upgrade between 1978 and 1982 in armour and in its missile armament from the SS.11 to the '''HOT''' ('''H'''igh Subsonic '''O'''ptical Remote-Guided, '''T'''ube-Launched) missiles with improved lethality and guidance system. The upgraded Raketenjagdpanzer 2 was called the '''[[RakJPz 2 (HOT)|Raketenjagdpanzer 2 HOT]]'''. This saw an improvement again between 1993 and 1995 when some extra armour, a new optic, and thermal imaging system were installed into the vehicle. This upgrade was called the Raketenjagdpanzer 3 Jaguar 1A3. The Raketenjagdpanzers were retired from the Bundeswehr in 2005 and the Austrian army in 2006, never seeing combat in the Cold War.
