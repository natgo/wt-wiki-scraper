== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The Ratel family of IFVs came to be in 1976 in South Africa to meet the needs of the South African Army. It pioneered many different areas of IFV development, such as being the first IFV in the world of a wheeled design to enter service worldwide, and the introduction of mine-protecting hulls on IFVs. The choice of a wheeled hull was due to the region's expansive deserts and relative lack of harsh terrain, as well as the longevity provided by wheels over tracked vehicles of similar types in maintenance. The Ratel 20 was the base variant of the Ratel family of IFVs, equipped with a 20 mm autocannon and MILAN anti-tank guided missiles. During its service with various militaries and international organizations, some of which still use the Ratels in active service, the Ratels provided valuable mobility and firepower to the lowest levels of the army, but were also often forced into situations beyond what they were originally designed for.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]]. Keeping in line with the previous [[Ratel 90]], it is in terms of chassis virtually unchanged. The only noticeable difference from the Ratel 90 is the turret and as a result the tank's armament, switching out the low velocity 90 mm gun for the original base configuration of a 20 mm autocannon and 7 MILAN ATGMs. This brings with it some playstyle changes, such as being able to use terrain more aggressively due to the increased gun depression and possibility of launching anti-tank missiles without presenting an easy target at short range, while losing the ability to directly go through enemies as the autocannon is not strong enough to fight medium tanks head-on. As the hull is underpowered for both the Ratel 20 and 90, it is recommended that you pick ground that has relatively mild terrain features (but not none) to utilize your tank's above average gun angles but also level enough that your tank doesn't struggle moving up and down a hill.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The Ratel 20 is not very different from the Ratel 90 at a first glance - the crew positioning and armour are identical and are quite poor. The turret and hull sides are vulnerable to 12.7 mm MG and the hull roof will implode if exploded by any kind of high explosives, but the armour is also thin enough to not trigger APHE at many angles of attack. The crew is quite tightly packed and there is only 3 members, so a bad hit to the middle of the tank will easily destroy the tank in RB and is likely to make it useless in AB.

What is different is the ammunition placement - there are no longer random HEAT shells scattered across the tank, instead there are small boxes of 20 mm shells behind the driver's head and a stack of ATGMs next to the engine on the left side. This greatly reduces the chances of being obliterated in a single shot, although a knowing opponent might just shoot the ATGM storage from the side.

The ATGM on top of the vehicle is a blessing and a curse at the same time - its positioning allows to repel incoming tanks without exposing the tank itself, but it can also detonate if hit hard enough and then overpressure the carrier, so at least some caution is advised when fighting a competent enemy.

Two smoke groups can be fired to create a 90 degree smoke screen in turret direction. The grenades fire rather far, so it will take longer than average to deploy, but it may also allow to use smoke offensively.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola)
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)
* Wheel (tires, suspension rods)
* Bulletproof glass (driver windows)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The mobility is identical to the Ratel 90. While it is slightly lighter, expecting this tank to drive any faster or to handle better than a giant armoured bus is unreasonable. As before, wheeled configuration allows it to accelerate faster on paved roads or off a hill and to carry its momentum when going off-road, which is necessary to get to the points of interest faster than other tanks.

In RB: when off road it will go -18 km/h in reverse, or begrudgingly drive 30 km/h forward with very slow acceleration past that mark. On a road it can drive around 72 km/h mark if given enough time to accelerate.

In AB: when off road it will go -20 km/h in reverse, or drive around 60 km/h forward with slow acceleration past that mark. Driving off a hill might push it to 72 km/h easily. When driving on a road, it might reach 96 km/h, but it might start sliding at this point and easily lose control if turned too hard.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|GI-2 (20 mm)}}

The 90 mm cannon was replaced by a 20 mm autocannon. The turret is not very different, so someone used to Ratel 90 will not find it too difficult to adapt to its behaviour. The cannon can aim higher than usual, allowing it to aim at the sky when needed, but it may require a hill to aim above the tank itself.

Autocannon fire rate is reasonably high, and the ammunition belts consist of 150 shells, so suppressing fire is an option, but the cannon can overheat if it fires 70 shots without pause, so if the target cannot be suppressed or destroyed with this ammunition amount, it is better to attack with ATGM immediately or to think of a better plan.

Almost all medium tanks (as well as heavy tanks) will be able to ignore the 20 mm autocannon, so in a direct engagement with heavier vehicles the autocannon can only be used to damage their externals (such as the tracks or cannons) and maybe engines or commander cupolas (as they sometimes have less armour than the rest of the tank).

==== Ammunition ====

All of the 20 mm belts consist of HVAP and HEI in different proportions.

HEI is a rather straightforward anti-air shell - it deals heavy damage upon hitting the aircraft or open-topped SPG and is useless against fully enclosed tanks.

HVAP has a rather high flat penetration for the calibre, but has abysmal angled penetration, to a point of being unable to penetrate the hull of some heavily angled light SPG and tanks. It also lacks the stopping power of the APDS and cannot overpenetrate engines, so while it can set them on fire, it will not hit anything past the engine decks (unless there are holes that could be punched through).

=== Additional armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}
<!-- ''Some tanks are armed with several guns in one or more turrets. Evaluate the additional weaponry and give advice on its use. Describe the ammunition available for additional weaponry. Give advice on about how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage. If there is no additional weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MILAN}}

As an additional weapon, the tank carries an Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) launcher on its top-right side. The ATGM in question is MILAN, which is one of the easier missiles to control and navigate, as it is rather agile and forgiving. The missile is controlled via sniper crosshairs as it is semi-automatic, which means that it doesn't block the driver controls when fired, unlike other early missiles, but requires the target to be visible the entire time.

The control point can be swapped between the 20 mm autocannon and the launcher itself with a special hotkey, but the missile Line-Of-Sight (LOS) is calculated off the 20 mm regardless. To hit the target past 160 m, tank autocannon must see the target, or at least the missile itself, otherwise the missile will automatically fall down. The only way to counteract this is to fire the missile into the sky and redirect it into the enemy at the very last second, but even this might be pushing the limits of the tank.

If directly controlled, the ATGM launcher can turn about 30 degrees away from the main gun horizontally, aim 5 degrees down or 15 degrees up. This mostly mirrors the usual angles of attack of the main gun.

In terms of the damage, consider MILAN as a very big HEAT shell with very high penetration - angle of attack most of the times means nothing, as the missile flight path can be corrected at any time, but low explosive mass (in TNT equivalent) means that the hit must be directed into some kind of a fatal weak spot, be it a big ammo rack or the crew compartment. The missile also has rather low overpressure damage, but a direct hit on light tank weakspots with less than 15 mm of armour may prove fatal anyway.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Use your excellent mobility on roads to flank the enemy and use your autocannon to hit side and rear armour. If you ever come face to face with a heavily armoured vehicle, use your ATGM. On rough terrain, support your teammates and use your ATGMs to pick off targets passing by. You can also help repair teammates and destroy lightly-armoured targets with your autocannon. Since your 20 mm isn't very useful against most tanks from the front, use it to take out tracks and gun barrels. The ratel is very long and hard to hide so always be careful that you are not exposing sections of your vehicle that the enemy can see. If opponent is charging your position and is closer than 200 m away, you can pull the launcher out and use it directly to stop them even if the autocannon is unable to control the missile.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* [[MILAN]] ATGM has good penetration values and is very easy to control, very hard to miss
** Although the missile launcher cannot truly control the missiles, it still can fire at anyone closer than 160 m directly without exposing the tank itself, which can be powerful both in offence and defence
* Ratel chassis is decently mobile when roads are present once fully upgraded; also has great reverse speed of 17 km/h
* 20 mm GI-2 gun has a high rate of fire and a useful elevation of +38°; perfect against low flying aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* Large size; difficult to conceal and manoeuvre on urban maps
* ATGM cannot be fired on the move, so unlike the Ratel 90 this tank often cannot "just rush" positions
* No stabilizer; the vehicle must stop to use the GI-2 cannon against medium/heavy tanks or over longer ranges
* Low engine power; the wheels also struggle on snow, sand or mud
* HVAP loaded into GI-2 cannon has poor performance against even light sloped armour plates as those on [[BMP-1 (Family)]], [[2S1]], [[C13 T90]], etc
* Armour is unreliable and poor; only 3 crew members and a large ATGM rack

'''Development'''
[[File:Ratel-20.jpg|alt=A UN Ratel-20 IFV in the Royal Tank Museum, Jordan.|left|thumb|A UN Ratel-20 IFV in the Royal Tank Museum, Jordan.]]
Named after the tenacious honey badger<ref>Scheepers, M., Pretorius, F. (2021) 'Loss of military equipment by the SADF at the Battle at Indungo during the Border War, 31 October 1987', ''Scientia Militaria, South African Journal of Military Studies'', Vol 49, Nr 2, pp. 58-9.</ref>, the Ratel Infantry Fighting Vehicle's development began in 1970 when the South African Defence Force required armoured vehicles which could cover the vast distances of the African plains. These requirements prioritised strong firepower and good protection to enable mechanised infantry to play their role within a highly mobile warfare doctrine. The SADF were already using British APCs, but these aligned with the British doctrine of mobilised infantry dismounting for engagements which was counter-intuitive to the direction of the diverging South African structure<ref name=":0">Harmse, K., Dunstan, S. (2017) ''South African Armour of the Border War 1975–89''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing, pp. 18-47.</ref>.
The SADF also used South African-designed armoured vehicles, yet these were liable to breakdowns and weapon failures which peaked during the South African Border War, exposing the weaknesses of older and cheaper IFV models and exposing the necessity for complete replacement to the more durable and reliable Ratel models. The South African derivative of the [[AML-90 (Family)|AML]], the [[Eland 90 Mk.7|Eland]] was successful as a reconnaissance vehicle with remarkable self-defence, and this would inspire the design of the Ratel which shares visual similarity<ref name=":0" />.

'''Combat usage'''

The Ratel would enter production in 1975 and see immediate success in the Angolan War from 1978. Despite a design based around flat terrain and infantry combat, the Ratel found itself excelling in challenging mountainous terrain and rainforests, fulfilling additional combat and support roles. In later produced modular variants, the Ratel utilised the cannon turret of the [[Eland 90 Mk.7|Eland]], ATGMs, and also support platforms such as observation and logistics<ref>O'Malley, T.J. (1996) ''Fighting Vehicles: Armoured Personnel Carriers and Infantry Fighting Vehicles''. London: Merlin Publications, pp. 98-9.</ref>.

The Ratel-20 would see combat in Operation Reindeer, 1978, Operation Sceptic, 1980, Operation Askari, 1983, and Operation Excite, 1988 for the SADF in Angola<ref name=":0" />. It still serves several African nations in the present day, including South Africa which maintains over one thousand Ratel IFVs in total comprising a significant percentage of the SADF's land fighting capability, and Ratel-20s have been used extensively by countries participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions<ref>Wezeman, P. (2011). 'South African Arms Supplies to Sub-Saharan Africa', Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</ref>.
