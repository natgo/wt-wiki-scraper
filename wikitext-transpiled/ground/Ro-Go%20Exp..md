== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]]. The Ro-Go Experimental is a modification of the [[Ro-Go]] platform. It features a French model 120 mm Schneider-Canet 1898 cannon as its main armament.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Similar to the Ro-Go it is based off of, the Ro-Go Experimental's armour is mostly comprised of large flat armour plates, though some are slightly angled. Front armour maxes out at 30 mm, with the angled sections such as the upper glacis being 25 mm thick. The shield surrounding the cannon, and by extension the crew, is 12 mm thick. Given the mostly flat shape of the Ro-Go Experimental's hull and relatively average armour thickness for its battle rating, a majority of incoming fire will be taken with full force, especially if it hits the flat plates at the front of the vehicle. Slightly angling the front of the Ro-Go Exp. may result in some shell ricochets, however. Much like its predecessor, the Ho-Ro, the Ro-Go Exp. can be easily penetrated by most other vehicles at its battle rating, but it does feature some odd angles that may result in lucky bounces. The Ro-Go Exp. does have a large crew count of 7, although they are rather lined up and a majority of them are in the open.

<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=412|rbMinHp=256}}

The Ro-Go Experimental shares the same drivetrain as the Ro-Go, featuring an inline 6-cylinder engine. It has mediocre mobility, noticeably more sluggish than its Chi-Ha based counterparts.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|Schneider-Canet 1898 (120 mm)}}

The 120 mm main armament of the Ro-Go Experimental will penetrate almost everything at its BR within a reasonable distance. The cannon, while considerably antiquated having been designed in 1897, fires a Semi-Armour-Piercing Capped Ballistic Capped round, which penetrates a maximum of 68 mm of armour at 10 m, even at 1,000 m the SAPCBC round can penetrate 53 mm of armour, certainly powerful enough to deal with most opponents at this BR. The round has a relatively low muzzle velocity and an average firing arc. The HE round has a significant amount of filler but does not have one shot potential like the HE round of the [[Ho-Ro]] or the [[S.I.G.33 (150 mm)]]. The SAPCBC round can also incur HE-type damage even if it does not penetrate due to its high filler content. However, it may be wise to carry a few dedicated HE rounds.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ro-Go Experimental plays like its predecessor on the tech tree, the Ho-Ro, but with some key differences. It has a faster reload time, but is noticeably less mobile and a larger target, a trait inherited from its basis on the Ro-Go chassis. Also unlike the Ho-Ro, the SAPCBC round has very good penetration and does not rely solely on HE filler to cause damage. It is completely open topped and the gun shield is only 12 mm thick, making the exposed crew extremely vulnerable to CAS and heavy machine gun fire. However, the Ro-Go Exp. does have some tricks up its sleeve - specifically the rear machine gunner. Like the Ro-Go, this crewman is largely useless in terms of offense, but will rarely be the first to be knocked out in a fight, essentially giving the player a somewhat guaranteed crew replacement. Play the Ro-Go Exp. like you would other Rank I and II Japanese Tank Destroyers, either freelance and find a good spot to get the jump on opponents, or stay back with other players and support from the rear. Like other Japanese SPG's, you are somewhat of a glass cannon. Remember that you can only spawn with 16 rounds maximum.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fantastic main armament for the BR.
** Low penetration fall off even at extreme ranges.
** One shot potential against most matchups.
** Faster reload than the Ho-Ro.
* More crew members than other tank destroyers in the lower rank Japanese tree (Ho-Ro and Ho-Ni series).
** Rear machine gun position provides opportunities for a "free" crew replacement.

'''Cons:'''

* Overall the armour is average at best, poor at worst.
** The crew is mostly exposed and is at the mercy of .50 calibers, aircraft, artillery and if flanked LMG fire.
* Mobility is overall worse compared to the majority of Chi-Ha based tank destroyers, the Ro-Go Experimental is comparatively sluggish.
** Mediocre top speed of 25 km/h.
* 16 shell maximum ammo count.
* Somewhat slow shell velocity can be hard to aim.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The '''Ro-Go Experimental''' (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Hi-Ro (sha) or Ji-Ro) was a prototypical field modification to the Type 95 Heavy Tank.
[[File:Ro-Go Experimental Historical.jpg|thumb|Ro-Go Experimental at factory grounds]]

The Type 95 Ro-Go Heavy Tank was in itself a low production experiment, but its hull was the basis for a few other trials, namely for its use as an SPG. The result of using a remaining unused Type 95 hull, field modifying the tank by replacing the two turrets with a 120 mm Schneider-Canet cannon mounted at the front of the chassis. Both a long and a short version of the cannon were tested. These cannons were originally of French origin and built under license by the Japanese.<ref>斯加式十二糎速射加農砲, [https://i.imgur.com/hH2ioDe.jpg Ref.C01007469500]</ref><ref>斯加式十二糎速射加農砲, [https://i.imgur.com/Eol46sS.jpg Ref.C01003984100]</ref>

A different configuration was brought to the drawing board by the original designer of the Type 95 Ro-Go, Tomio Hara. He designed what would be known as the Ji-Ro on the same hull but with more modification to the base hull, completely getting rid of all the 3 turrets, moving the engine and fully enclosing the casemate at the end of the vehicle.<ref>[https://i.redd.it/qrlwlvyyohl11.jpg Ji-Ro Blueprint]</ref>
