== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 "Assault"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The Ro-Go is an excellently protected vehicle for 1.3. Featuring armour thick enough to stop 12.7 mm machine-gun fire from all angles (except the roof), and even anti-tank guns if angled properly. The placement of modules deep down inside the hull, where most 1.3 players would never think of shooting, makes the chance that the ammo, engine, transmission and fuel tanks get hit rather low. Even the crew inside the tank are pretty well protected by the tank's armour, and if everything fails you still have the lone machine gunner in the back turret, which means that a lot of the time you will be able to make a partial recovery from getting shredded to pieces by the waves of Pz.IIs and M2A4s.

'''Armour type:'''

==== Ammunition ====
The only real choice is the '''Type 3 HEAT''': it has the penetrating power to defeat any armour at this BR, and it can also inflict overpressure damage to lightly-armoured and open-topped vehicles. On the flip side, it has the lowest velocity of all the available shells and it's advised to learn to get accommodated to this round nonetheless.

The Type 95 Ro-Go, like most landships, is the perfect vehicle to lead an assault. It can take a beating due its relatively thick armour and with the crew placement it shouldn't be an easy task to simply knock it out with a single shell. The tricky part about the Ro-Go is the difference between shell velocities of the two cannons, the 70 mm has an abysmal muzzle velocity and quick drop off rate with 300 m/s on the ''Type 95 APHE'' and a mere 200 m/s on the ''Type 3 HEAT'' while the secondary cannon, a [[Type 94 (37 mm)|''37 mm Type 94'']], found on the [[Ha-Go|Type 95 Ha-Go]] has 575 m/s. As last armament to mention the Ro-Go has a MG turret in the back of the tank, which in-game won't really see much use and can be seen as a safe spot for the last crew member, but in-case a light armoured truck tries to flank the Ro-Go and no-one is covering the back, as last resort the MG could prove handy.

As noted in [[#Ammunition|ammunition]], the only real choice is the '''''Type 3 HEAT''''' round, as it has the highest filler and penetration force of all available rounds at the cost of muzzle velocity. Though this can be used in an advantage as enemies behind cover are never safe when an experienced Ro-Go tanker is around, and lobs shells over cover with ease.

The ''37 mm Type 94'' can be used to either be used to shoot beyond the regular range of the 70 mm, or bait out shots in close range so the enemies pop out of cover and make quick work of them with the main 70 mm cannon.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Main gun with 70 mm HEAT and the secondary with 37 mm APHE are a deadly combination
* 70 mm's HEAT velocity of 200 m/s (one of the slowest in the game) means that it can shoot enemies behind cover
* Great gun depression and good elevation
* Six crew vehicle
* The secondary frontal turret can act as a shield to absorb some hits
* Has armour relatively thick enough to stop heavy machine gun fire
* Good manoeuvrability for a heavy tank
* 70 mm HEAT shells excel in both penetration and damage
* Modules are very well hidden in the vehicle

'''Cons:'''

* Slow turret traverse makes the Ro-Go easy to flank
* Features only a single machine gun in a rear turret
* Two massively different trajectories for the main guns
* Back turret ammo runs out very quickly
* Very slow
* Penetration with standard APHE for both guns is lacking
* Low velocity HEAT shell can be difficult to aim
* Easy to ammorack
* Highly susceptible to large-calibre chemical shells

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

After World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army experimented with some possibility of multi-turreted tanks design based French Renault FT light tank. The development of the Type 95 Ro-Go heavy tank is based on the older version of the tank, the Type 91 heavy tank, which featured only a single 57 mm gun and two turrets, which both armed with a 6.5 mm machine guns. The tank had a maximum armour plate thickness of 17 mm. Although the design was not successful and soon cancelled, this project became the stepping stone to the Type 95 Ro-Go tank.
