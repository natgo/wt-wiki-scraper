Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''Rochev''' was the name given by the IDF to the M109 self-propelled howitzer gun. They received the M109 before the Yom Kippur War of 1973, and the nickname  was associated with the variants from M109 to M109A2. Most of differences between all of these variants were internal and especially regarding the shell loading system. While the early M109 was used during the Yom Kippur War and Lebanon War of 1982, by the 2006 Lebanon War, only the longer barrel M109s with the new M185 cannon were still in service, with some field modifications to improve quality of life and or survivability of the crew, like extra machine guns or outside storage compartments.

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is very similar to the normal M109 in the Israeli tech tree. It features a new cannon specifically the M185 cannon that is of the same 155 mm calibre of the regular gun of the M109. This means that the penetration is not improved but the shows have actually a longer range and the higher speed so aiming is much easier with this vehicle. The addition of more machine guns increase the ability of this vehicle to deal with close air support and light attack planes like the P-51 and BF 109 that can be relatively easily destroyed with a precise shot of heavy machine gun. Still the tank has relatively poor survivability and the reload time is quite large, however the high explosive shell is powerful enough to deal with most MBTs if aimed properly. No need to mention that like tanks like the AML-90 and the AMX-13 stand very little chance against your high explosive shells since their lack of armour make them extremely vulnerable to this kind of projectiles.

{{main|M185 (155 mm)}}

The [[M185 (155 mm)|155 mm M185]] is a decently competent weapon for its BR, compared to other artillery guns, it has the standard 155mm cannon. It lacks access to a proper HEAT shell, but the HE shell is powerful enough to deal with most threats. The cannon is not stabilized and thus it takes time to aim after a full stop.

The machine guns in the Rochev consist of a 12.7mm M2HB and a 7.62mm M1919A4, this guns are not powerful enough to deal with ground targets and don't have enough power to deal with most aircrafts. However they can be used to some extent to destroy the tracks or tires of enemy vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Rochev should be played like the regular M109. This means that, since it lacks the precision and the agility to be used as a frontline vehicle it works best in the back of your team and flanking under the cover of conventional main battle tanks. 

The HE shell in the Rochev is powerful enough to deal with most enemies, however this comes at the cost of precision. You dont have a laser rangefinder or a stabilizer in your cannon. Thus if you want to attack enemy positions, be aware of your surroundings and try to hear the engine sounds coming from enemy tanks. Getting to a good position at the middle of the map or in the sides that allows you to have a good field of view is an excellent tactic with this vehicle, alternatively you can also defend a certain capture point, helping your team while they deal with the main enemy force.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 155mm HE shell, capable of dealing with most tanks
* Decent mobility for an SPG
* Access to smoke shells and a long range, useful to create smoke screens in the middle of the map
* More machine guns compared to the previous M109
* Longer range and thus easier aim, compared to the smaller barrel M109s

'''Cons:'''

* Very little armour against anything higher than 20 mm shots
* Crammed crew compartment, which translates to poor survivability
* Low fire rate at less than 4 rounds per minute
* No access to a stabilizer or dedicated anti tank shells
