== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Rooikat Medium Turret Technology Demonstrator (MTTD)''' was a prototype based on the [[Rooikat (Family)|Rooikat]] hull to test the possibility of an autoloading system mounted in a remote turret. The loader and commander positions were lowered into the hull, leaving a smaller turret occupied solely by the gun and autoloading bustle. A mock launcher for an active protection system was also installed on top of the turret, but not fitted with any of the equipment required to allow it to function.

Introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]], the Rooikat MTTD is a powerful upgrade over the preceding [[Rooikat Mk.1D]]. Featuring a 105 mm cannon like the [[Rooikat 105]], it offers strong firepower coupled with the quick autoloader continuously reloading at rates matching those of other vehicles' ace crews. While it lacks the most powerful DM33 round of the Rooikat 105, the ammunition options are still generally sufficient for the opponents the MTTD will face, and it retains the excellent mobility of previous Rooikats that make them such versatile vehicles. However, with the addition of the autoloader and lower-profile turret, a compromise must be made — the MTTD lacks common features such as smoke grenades or machine guns, which players may come to rue in particular times of need.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Rooikat MTTD can generally be considered to be lightly armoured. The frontal armour can resists machine gun fire, or autocannons from long-range and at an angle. Side armour can be penetrated by machine guns larger than 12.7 mm at close range, with the rear armour being even weaker. A somewhat spacious hull allows for poorly aimed shots to potentially fail to hit any critical modules, but chemical rounds will destroy the vehicle through overpressure. The turret features recessed crew members, allowing for careful use of the gun depression to only expose the gun and auto-loader ammo rack when hull-down. Chemical rounds may very well still trigger overpressure when hitting the turret, or detonating the turret ammo rack. The Rooikat MTTD features poor overall armour and survivability, and should use the vehicle's mobility to avoid the possibility of receiving a hit in the first place. The vehicle also inherits the stock brown-yellow camouflage from the rest of the South Africa line, allowing the vehicle to be easily spotted on non-desert maps.

'''Armour type:'''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=879|rbMinHp=501}}

The Rooikat MTTD features extremely good mobility, with limitations. The engine will power the vehicle to a top speed of 130 km/h (AB) / 120 km/h (RB/SB) on roads, though the average speed is around 35 to 55 km/h off road. The wheeled chassis will allow to turn the vehicle without losing too much speed, though the size of the vehicle means it will have a large turn radius, and it lacks the ability to perform neutral steering. Like for most armoured cars, snow, sand, and dirt will bring this vehicle to a crawl (<10 km/h in RB/SB). Performance on any sort of hill or incline is poor with low traction, making some normally accessible slopes impossible to climb. Although the vehicle is capable of high speeds, care should be taken to plan and familiarize map routes that will allow this vehicle to reach an advantageous position quickly. The vehicle characteristics favour open, rural maps over urban maps. When on urban maps, the vehicle's large turning radius will hamper its freedom of movement in narrow streets and between buildings.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Autoloader mechanism offers reliable reload time
* GT-7 cannon ballistics characteristics are competitive
* The superb top speed of the Rooikat chassis remains
* Equipped with features enhancing its combat capability: laser rangefinder, thermal imager, ESS and NVD
* Crew location and good gun depression allows safer hull-down attacks

'''Cons:'''

* Only 3 crew members
* No secondary armament or coaxial machine gun
* Mobility is heavily affected by uneven terrain, mud, snow, sand
* Lacklustre power to weight ratio: struggles climbing slopes or rocks
* GT-7 penetration is unreliable versus late Soviet MBT frontal armour as on [[T-72 (Family)]], [[T-80 (Family)]] or [[T-90A]]

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The Rooikat Medium Turret Technology Demonstrator (MTTD) was a private venture to test the concept of a Rooikat-based 105 mm / 120 mm gun turret with an automatic loading system.

It used a regular production Rooikat hull with a completely new two-man turret. The loader/commander was positioned on the left side of the turret and the gunner was located on the right side, both in sunken positions allowing a low profile wedge shape for the turret where the crew was located. The main gun was in the centre, a 105 mm high pressure gun but it was intended also to test a 120 mm low pressure gun. The main gun was automatically loaded with ammunition from the turret bustle. An active protection system (APS) mock-up was located on the rear of the turret but was not functional. The Rooikat MTTD was only a demonstrator vehicle and never entered production.<ref>https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/south_africa/rooikat.php</ref>
