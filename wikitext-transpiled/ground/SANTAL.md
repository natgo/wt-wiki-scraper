== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Developed in the late 1980s, the '''SANTAL''' was adapted from the VAB APC platform to fulfill the Self-Propelled Anti-Air (SPAA) role. This evolution was marked by the integration of the Mistral surface-to-air missile system in 1987, providing the vehicle with robust air defense capabilities. The Mistral SPAA variant of the SANTAL became a vital component of France's air defense strategy, offering rapid deployment and engagement of aerial threats. Its introduction addressed the need for enhanced protection of ground troops against airborne threats, such as helicopters and low-flying aircraft. The integration of Mistral missiles greatly increased the operational flexibility of the SANTAL, enabling it to effectively contribute to both ground-based and mobile air defense operations. Through its historical development and adaptations, the SANTAL-Mistral remains a testament to the evolution of modern military vehicles, showcasing the fusion of armoured transport with sophisticated air defense systems.

It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]]. The VAB APC platform's adaptability shines through its modular design, allowing for quick reconfiguration based on requirements, producing vehicles such as the SANTAL and [[MEPHISTO]]. The SANTAL further augments its combat prowess by integrating the Mistral surface-to-air missile system, granting the SANTAL the ability to engage aerial targets with precision and speed. This dual-role capability – as both an agile armoured personnel carrier and an air defense platform – makes the SANTAL a versatile asset on the battlefield, capable of swiftly transitioning between providing ground support and countering airborne threats. Whether operating independently or as part of a larger force, the SANTAL's combat capabilities have solidified its reputation as a reliable and multifaceted asset, poised to meet the challenges of modern warfare.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The SANTAL's mobility stands as its primary method of survival on the battlefield. While its armour provides minimal protection, the ability to swiftly navigate the terrain is what truly sets the vehicle apart. Designed with agility in mind, the SANTAL can quickly manoeuvre through diverse landscapes, allowing it to evade threats and find advantageous positions. Its advanced suspension system and powerful engine grant it the speed and manoeuvrability required to outmanoeuvre adversaries, making it a challenging target to engage effectively. The SANTAL's mobility not only aids in rapid deployment and repositioning but also facilitates its role in reconnaissance, support, and air defense. By capitalizing on its exceptional mobility, the SANTAL maximizes its survivability by minimizing exposure to hostile fire and swiftly reacting to evolving combat dynamics. This emphasis on mobility as a cornerstone of survival underscores the vehicle's adaptability and effectiveness in multiple warfare scenarios.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The SANTAL platform has revolutionized French top tier SPAA in the battlefield, showcasing its dynamic capabilities in safeguarding friendly units from airborne threats. The integration of the Mistral surface-to-air missile system, a highly effective infrared-guided (IR) missile with fire-and-forget capabilities, combined with the vehicle's inherent mobility, has enabled the SANTAL to provide an agile and responsive air defense solution. Notably, Mistral missiles are designed to autonomously track and engage targets using their infrared guidance, without requiring continuous operator input. It's important to mention that Mistral missiles do not trigger defense systems automatically; they are primarily detected and countered by Missile Approach Warning (MAW) systems typically mounted on top-tier helicopters but remain unseen by other aircraft unless visual contact is made. This highlights the critical role of the SANTAL's skilled crew in target acquisition and engagement.

By utilizing its rapid mobility, the SANTAL can swiftly position itself to create protective umbrellas over friendly forces, dissuading or neutralizing incoming aircraft threats. The Mistral missiles, known for their accuracy and effectiveness, ensure precise target engagement. This dual emphasis on mobility and autonomous air defense capability not only shields friendly units but also disrupts enemy air superiority, influencing the outcome of engagements. As an SPAA platform, the SANTAL exemplifies the synergy between advanced missile technology, the expertise of its operators, and strategic mobility, solidifying its vital role in enhancing overall operational success while maintaining air superiority over the battlefield.

=== Pros and cons ===
