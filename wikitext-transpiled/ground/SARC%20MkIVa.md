== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The SARC MkIVa has poor survivability, with the 12 mm rounds able to penetrate the sides and 20 mm rounds the front. The crew is very tightly packed, meaning that any shot that hits one crew member it likely to knock out at least two. The SARC being open-topped leaves it highly vulnerable to even low calibre HE and aircraft bullets.

The SARC MkIVa's manoeuvrability and good reverse gear should be used to avoid getting hit and ambush the enemy. Vehicles with 20 mm autocannons and enemy SPAAs are very dangerous for the SARC, as they can easily shred its armour.

<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The MkIVa does not accelerate quickly. In a city fight or in a sniping match, this is a liability.

This is offset by its very high top speed of 80 km/h. This grants it unmatched speed on flat terrain. Combined with its smaller size, this gives the MkIVa the opportunity to sneak into a hidden location and get flanking shots on unsuspecting enemies.

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=147|rbMinHp=84}}

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The MKIVa depends on mobility. Due to the relatively low chance that the crew will survive getting shot, crew replacement is not an immediate priority. Instead, focus first on spare parts and FPE, then better ammunition, then mobility improvements. The strength of the MKIVa is its speed, so upgrades that facilitate that are important. Ignore brakes for last: you shouldn't need to stop better, you need to get to a hiding spot faster.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}
=== Main armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}
<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|QF 2-pounder (40 mm)}}

The QF 2-Pounder is a solid weapon for its tier. It can frontally penetrate most vehicles at its BR, but excels in flanking shots. The stock Shot MK. 1 AP shell has poor performance, so take effort to phase this out in favour of the better performing Shot MK IX APCBC.

The slow rotation speed of the turret means that the gun should ideally used in an ambush role on the sides of enemy tanks. The relatively high fire rate also allows for consistent fires on enemy targets.

Be advised that the QF 2-pounder loses accuracy over  500 meters, so it is ill advised to use the gun for this purpose: leave the sniping for the tank destroyers and concentrate on ambushing.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|M1919A4 (7.62 mm)}}

|-
|}

The M1919A4 is a good machine gun, though it is only useful for knocking out lightly-armoured vehicles like trucks or the occasional half-tracks. The high ammo count per belt means that sustained fire can be used to check bushes and smoke for obscured targets.

In an emergency, it can be used as an anti-aircraft weapon, but the poor damage output and turret rotation speed makes this option less advisable.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very small profile; difficult to hit at range
* Small ammo rack size
* High straight-line top speed on paved surfaces
* Quick reload speed
* Fast acceleration; top speed can be reached fairly quickly

'''Cons:'''

* Can be easily penetrated by rifle-calibre rounds
* Low survivability with only three crew members
* Off-road mobility is lacklustre
* Difficult to control at high speeds
* Slow turret rotation and gun elevation
* Below-average gun depression

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The South African Reconnaissance Car (SARC), known in British service as the Marmon-Herrington<ref>David Fletcher, Tank Chat #129, The Tank Museum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQmaXWPouno</ref>, had a remarkably diverse pedigree, as it combined components made in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, put together in South Africa.  The service record of its variants was similarly far-flung, despite its relatively small production numbers, as it saw service in WW2, Cyprus, across Africa, and even (from captured Japanese stock) Indonesia.<ref name=":0">[[wikipedia:Marmon-Herrington_Armoured_Car|[Wikipedia] Marmon-Herrington Armoured Car]]</ref>

This variant, the Mark IV, fitted a 40 mm 2-pdr. gun in an artillery mounting, not the usual tank-style mantlet.  It arrived rather late in WW2, but saw action post-war in Cyprus and with the Arab League.  Earlier versions fought with the 1st King’s Dragoon Guards at the Siege of Tobruk in 1941.<ref name=":0" />
