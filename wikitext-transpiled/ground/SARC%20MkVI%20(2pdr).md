== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

The SARC (''South African Reconnaissance Car'') also known as the Marmon-Herrington is an armoured car developed by South Africa during World War II, now present in the game as an entry vehicle on the South African ground forces sub-tree.

The 2-Pounder variant present in the game features a Quick Firing 2-pounder gun of 40 mm, several light machine guns and a variety of auxiliary abilities as scouting and smoke charges - An excellent vehicle for adept teamplayers. The SARC is not just decently equipped but is also highly mobile on most grounds. This pleasant high mobility is the distinction of both of the SARCs presents in the game and certainly, of most following South African vehicles.

To recap, the balanced mix of firepower and speed brings to tankers of the British ground forces, a very competent early light car.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Overall the vehicle is very lightly armoured, it does not have enough armour to stop anything above a small-calibre machine gun and it is vulnerable to overpressure. There are some places on the rear where even a 7.62 mm machine gun will find its way through. The most reliable armour is the frontal armour thanks to the angled plates and the gun mantlet.

For its misfortune, It is also open-topped, and with one of the 4 crew members partially exposed. The SARC will find itself getting strafed out by planes very frequently. However, sometimes the side armour might not cause APHE fuses to go off, successfully saving the vehicle from any damage, although this is inconsistent and in no way reliable. Overall, it's not very well armoured considering its turret is also exposed, and thus comparably worse than the Axis analogue, the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]] (Puma).

Aside from the unreliability of the armour, the vehicle might hold off some poorly aimed shots to areas as the gun mantlet and the lower powertrain. The 30 mm gun mantlet features < 150 mm in angling on some areas capable of bouncing off shells, while the tall profile might increase survivability in some situations as careless shots are likely to pass under the vehicle without major damage to fighting modules or the crew. On close-quarters battles, self-propelled assault tanks like the low-profile [[StuG III A]] or [[StuH 42 G]] might hastily aim at this area, causing most likely the immobilization of the SARC yet with intact crew members.

But being tall is also an unfavourable trait for survivability since on plain maps like the [[Carpathians (Ground Forces)|Carpathians]], the SARC or the commander atop will be easily spotted; using the spare set of stock smoke grenades might help overcome these encounters.

'''Armour type:'''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The SARC can navigate its way through most environments speedily and get into an optimal position. However, it is worth noting that due to its tall profile, high centre of gravity and its 8-wheeled configuration that is does not turn as sharply or cleanly as the Daimler and is slower owing to its additional weight.

Player should take care to learn the dangers of snowy, boggy or sandy ground early as to prevent leaving their vehicle bereft of its strong mobility at crucial moments. But where the ground does not give way, the excellent suspension of South African vehicles will introduce itself to the player front and centre when speeding over hills and rocky terrain.

On the open road, the SARC will hit and comfortably cruise at its top speed of 65 km/h while speed on uneven ground will range from roughly 41-45 km/h. It is worth noting that compared to its top speeds the SARC only boasts a reverse of -18 Km/h maximum, while not awful it is sluggish compared to the forward acceleration of the vehicle and worth considering in factoring any getaway options in battle.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
Stock, the SARC MkVI (2pdr) boasts great mobility and turret adjustment speeds. So which early modification unlock is the player's choice, however it is advised to prioritise unlocking the Shell Mk.1 AP/T due to its explosive filler being a quickly-lost luxury for the GB tree. The explosive-filled shell means the rapid firing 2-pounder gun can maximise its damage potential and ensure any penetration is a disabling or crippling shot. Enhancing the mobility of the SARC is advised throughout the modification tree however as it relies on its mobility to survive.

{{main|QF 2-pounder (40 mm)}}

Being a light vehicle with a tall profile, the centre of gravity on the {{PAGENAME}} is very high. Coupled with the recoil of the gun, this gives a wobbly effect when firing over the sides (not so much when firing forwards or backwards).

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The SARC MkVI (2pdr) represents a blend of advantages and challenges that can be approached by the player in mostly any way they see fit. While highly mobile, a tall profile and thin armour present significant factors that must be considered if this vehicle is to be played to any success.

It is possible to flank with the SARC very readily if the terrain is advantageous to the top speed of the vehicle where it can position itself ahead of the team, spot enemies and provide harassing if not outright disabling fire with its 2pdr gun. However, it is worth noting that at its BR the 2pdr begins to show its age and the ability to flank with the SARC will be crucial in making sure it can remain effective with side-shots and exposing weaknesses in enemy armour. Once again, the explosive-filled Mk. 1 AP/T is highly recommended to make the most of any penetrating shots with its explosive filler.

While they suffer from a lack of vertical angle due to the nature of the mounting, the SARC MkVI (2pdr) boasts a pair of 7.62 mm machine guns atop its turret, in a pinch it can serve as makeshift SPAA, capable of deterring or outright shooting down early aircraft with saturating fire. Especially if an opponent is not expecting such fire to occur from positions the SARC may likely be seated on. While less effective on enclosed vehicles due to their calibre, the machine guns are also excellent for dispatching open-topped vehicles such as SPAAs commonly encountered when pushing past enemy lines.

;Enemies worth noting

* [[:Category:Anti-aircraft vehicles|SPAAs]] - Up to its BR, all nations it will face will be sporting SPAAs with weapons of increasing calibre such as the 37 mm Flak 36 cannon from the German tech tree or the common sight of the various GMC vehicles from the USA. All will be encountered behind enemy lines typically and can easily destroy a SARC if able to return fire.
* [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]] - A German contemporary of the SARC, with superior mobility and firepower it is very likely this vehicle will be encountered attempting the same tactics as the SARC and will be a deadly opponent if the SARC does not manage to disable, evade or destroy it first.
* [[AB 43]] - Much like the Sd.Kfz.234/2 above the dangers are identical, faster and capable of delivering more punishment than the SARC it should be treated with the same respect and caution.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast-firing 40 mm gun with adequate ballistics
* High mobility of the SARC chassis; reverse speed also useful
* Frontal armour can withstand heavy machine gun at some distances
* Shoulder stabilizer is useful in some situations
* Equipped with Scouting, anti-air capable machine guns and numerous quick-release smoke grenades
* Quick turret traverse speed

'''Cons:'''

* Open-top turret with a crew member partially visible
* Side and top armour is vulnerable to machine guns and autocannons
* 40 mm gun struggles to penetrate sloped armour such as the [[T-34 (1940)]] or [[M4]]
* Tall profile and prone to rollover while turning at high speeds
* Limited off-road mobility on snow, mud and sand; typical of most wheeled cars
* High centre of mass gives the gun a wobbly handling when firing to the sides

'''Development'''

The Marmon-Herrington Mk V (also known as South African Reconnaissance Car/SARC Mk V) was a prototype for an eight wheeled armored car produced for South Africa by the Marmon-Herrington Corporation. It ended up very heavy at sixteen tonnes, much too heavy to meet requirements. As such, a project was started to create a lighter eight wheeled armored car known as the Mk VI. During the development it was questioned whether the Mk VI should be armed with the 2-pounder or 6-pounder gun, so two prototypes were made (one with each gun). The prototypes were built in 1943.<ref name=":0">http://aviarmor.net/tww2/armored_cars/uac/marmon_mk6.htm</ref>

'''Design'''

A completely new eight wheeled chassis was designed for the Mk VI. All eight wheels were powered and both the first and last axles were used for steering. The hull was taller than that of the Mk V and used a distinctive angled armor construction. The crew compartment was at the front of the vehicle and the engine compartment was at the rear; the driver's compartment was at the very front and the turret was in the center. As no powerful enough engine could be acquired, two separate 95 horsepower Ford V8 engines were fitted for at total of 190 horsepower. The transmission had four forward and one reverse gear. With a weight of 11,185 kilograms, the Mk VI was over five tonnes lighter than the Mk V and had much better performance with a maximum speed of 65 km/h and a range of 400 km. The two prototypes had different turrets but both had a radio station in the turret bustle.

The first prototype mounted the 40 mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder gun in an open-topped turret. The open-topped turret was crewed by three men - commander, gunner, and loader - which made a total of four crew members. Secondary armament consisted of a 7.92 mm Besa machine gun with two 7.62 mm (.30 cal) M1919 Browning machine guns mounted on top of the turret.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">http://www.warwheels.net/MarmonHerrington6INDEX.html</ref>

'''Production and Service'''

The two prototypes were completed in 1943. The first prototype with 2-pounder gun was sent to the UK while the second prototype with 6-pounder gun was kept in South Africa. The British Army expressed interest in the Mk VI and even ordered 250 of them but cancelled the order as they were no longer needed once American armored cars such as the M8 Greyhound became available for import in 1943. The first prototype can still be found at the Bovington Tank Museum in Britain.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
