== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

[[File:Armour heatmap of the SK-105.png|thumb|Heatmap of the SK105's armour]]

The hull armour of the SK-105A2, even though it is angled at 62°, is relatively weak. In most cases, it will stop 20 mm cannons but cannons with a bigger calibre will have no problems punching right trough the hull armour which in most cases leads to an instant death, as the crew is sitting tightly packed together. Rapid firing autocannons such as the ones mounted on the [[Gepard]] or the [[ZSU-37-2]] will have no problems shredding the SK-105 in less than a second. It is highly recommend to not take more than 24 shells due to the fact that reserve shells pile up in the front most part of the tank, which might lead to even more frequent instant deaths. If the user can manage their rounds effectively, the safest ammo count would be 16. This way, only 4 extra rounds are placed into the turret and no rounds are in the front of the tank.

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour (Front of the turret, Gun mantlet)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret roof)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=496|rbMinHp=283}}

The SK-105 has an exceptional speed of about 59 km/h forwards on roads, and around -9 km/h in reverse while also being relatively manoeuvrable, as it is very similar to the [[AMX-13]] light tank. It is powered by the Steyr 7FA/6-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine, which provides 320 hp (238 kW) for a power-to-weight ratio of 18 hp/ton. While it can go as fast as 59 km/h, one should expect to move at about 40 km/h off-road, however the reserve speed still stays at -9 km/h, and it takes roughly 12 seconds for the SK-105 to rotate 360° in neutral steering.

{{main|PzK M57 (105 mm)}}

In terms of weaponry, the SK-105 carries the 105 mm PzK M57, which is very effective at dispatching almost every enemy tank with a well-placed shot. It possesses a 4-second autoloader with a magazine size of 12 rounds. After the 12 rounds were depleted, the user has to wait until the magazine houses at least one round. This can be quite problematic if one is too trigger-happy.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modelled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* The visual discrepancy concerns the number of rounds: 42 shells are modelled, but only 38 shells can be fired. Rack 1 is therefore always empty.
* Rack 3 and 4 (autoloader magazines) are first stage ammo racks. They total 12 shells.
** These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.
** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
** Once the autoloader magazines have been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 2 into rack 4 then 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
** The depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 2.

=== Machine guns ===

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|MG3A1 (7.62 mm)}}

The SK-105 has access to the [[MG3A1 (7.62 mm)]] machine gun. While it lacks any some sort of effective penetration, its high rate of fire can dispatch exposed crew members easily. The one, and only, belt houses 1,000 rounds with average velocity. It is largely inadequate against armour and should be used exclusively to dispatch exposed crew members or to destroy environmental objects such as fences with ease.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The SK-105A2 excels at filling the spot as a sniper, due to its very powerful 105 mm cannon, low profile and high mobility. This is all balanced out however by the fact that the SK-105 possesses little to no armour, so any kind of hit from a cannon more powerful than 20 mm, will dispatch the SK-105 quite easily. The user should always check their surrounding as much they can, and as frequently as they can. Finding a vantage point with cover nearby is an effective strategy. Brawls and rushes should generally be avoided and tactics like flanking or sniping should be focused upon, as the SK-105 will stand no chance in direct engagements or close quarter fights. However, if one does stumble into a brawl, the 4-second autoloader will prove to be a major benefit coupled with the amazing 105 mm cannon; although one should pay attention to their magazine as the user will not be able to shoot at all if the magazine runs dry completely. It is because of this reason that at least 2 spare rounds should be carried in the magazine in case of an ambush. One big thing to note is that the user also lacks a stabilizer, which may be a problem due to the light size of the tank and fast speed; as these properties will make the gun harder to stabilize on its own if the user decides to brake spontaneously.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 12-round autoloader with a 4-second reload time
* Strong APFSDS shells
* Has a smoke grenade launcher with 2 salvos
* Has access to night vision device and 2nd generation thermal imager on gunner optics

[[File:Patagon1.jpg|thumb|A Patagón tank next to an SK-105 A1.]]

The SK-105 was developed by the company named Saurer-Werk, as the Austrian Army needed a reliable tank destroyer. The very first prototype was built in the year 1967 and the pre-production began in the year 1971. Around 286 were made for the Austrian Army and were in service until the 1990s, while the rest of the SK-105s were exported.

The hull of the SK-105 was based on the heavily armoured car, Saurer APC, which was used alongside Austrian units. This allowed the tank destroyer to be light and have above average mobility, something the Austrian Army wanted. While the hull of the tank was an easy choice to make, as the Saurer APC hull required just a few modifications to be adequate for the standards set by the Austrian Army, the debate now was which turret should the SK-105 use. Since the Austrian Army wanted a cannon that was light, reliable yet still powerful enough to fulfil its role of a tank destroyer, they turned their eyes towards France. Because of their massive success and mass production of AMX-13 light tank, the Austrian army decided to contact France in the hopes of designing a new turret. In the end, France agreed and came up with an oscillating turret that was light yet powerful enough to be used in an anti-tank role.

While Austria retired the SK-105, a substantial amount is still in service today in other countries: mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina. Argentina created the "Patagón" variant by merging a brand-new hull with surplus AMX-13 (105) turrets, the result was a vehicle comparable to the SK-105 A1.
