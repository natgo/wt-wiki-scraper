== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.45 "Steel Generals"]]. The SMK was named after Sergei Mironovich Kirov, an early Communist Party official who was assassinated in 1934. A twin-turret heavy tank, the SMK provides an interesting playstyle to its users. Only one prototype was built before the project was dropped.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour
- Cast homogeneous armour (Turret fronts)

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Confidently stand against most enemy tanks especially if they are without support, use caution against engaging multiple targets from a distance however as a track hit will end any day on the battlefield, the SMK packs its biggest punch up close and cannot expect to survive against sniping units if caught in the open. Keep the tank moving as much as possible and slightly angled facing enemies directly. When engaging heavies it's best to not go toe to toe head on however by disabling a track or turret the SMK can hold itself up in close proximity to most heavy enemy tanks. HE and shrapnel shells are not this tanks forte, rather its APHE rounds usually due to the trick against most enemy units.

Attack and break enemy lines, The SMK is very much a tank worthy of entitling "Not one step back"! A fast load rate and dual turret firing system allow this tank multiple scores even when surrounded or disabled, and the sizeable crew enables quick repair, which is great as its size makes the SMK a juicy target that is more than capable of withstanding incredible amounts of damage. Great at providing weaker units cover and protection from enemy fire, the one-two punch of its cannons reward players that love using more aggressive playing styles.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Two turrets, two guns. A punchy 45 mm and a slow, but steady 76 mm
- Consistent armour all-round, effective against circling low rank tanks like [[Flakpanzer 38]]
- Outstanding Mobility for a heavy tank (15 hp/t)
- Can defend itself even when one gunner is injured thanks to the two turrets
- Very difficult to destroy in one hit thanks to the large interior

'''Cons:'''

- Gigantic size, very easy target
- The additional turret won't really help when being circled
- Armour isn't strong against tanks at the same BR like the [[Pz.IV (Family)|Pz.IV]]
- Somewhat unique playstyle which may need practice
- Big ammo rack in the second turret (cannot be removed)
- Bad reverse gear

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

===Development===
The development of the '''SMK''' began after the [[T-35]] heavy tank flaws came to light. The T-35 was unreliable and expensive, so the project was made to replace it. The project was headed by former OKMO designer N. Barykov and started in 1937 at the Bolshevik Plant with a specification that the tank could withstand 45 mm hits from point-blank ranges and 75 mm artillery at 1,200 m. The design drawn up in 1938 was still a multi-turret design like the T-35, but the number of turrets was reduced to just two and a wide-track torsion-bar suspension was utilized instead of a spring suspension. The SMK was also redesigned to two different prototypes, the one with two turrets and the other with a single turret installed instead. These two designs were approved by Stalin and the single turret one was named after then Soviet Defense Commissar Kliment Voroshilov as the KV, the forerunner for the [[KV-1 (L-11)|KV-1 heavy tanks]].

The SMK design weighed 55 tons and had two turrets mounted with one in front of the other, with the one in the mid-hull area as the main turret and the one in front as the secondary turret. The main turret was mounted higher than the secondary and had the 76.2 mm L-11 gun mounted while the smaller one had a 45 mm 20-K gun mounted. The design was powered by a GAM-34BT engine that produces 850 hp for the vehicle. The tank suspension was a torsion-bar suspension for improved smoothness over other suspension designs. Armour on the front hull was 75 mm thick in the front and 60 mm on the sides.

===Testing===
As part of the heavy tank evaluations, the designs submitted for the project were to be battle-tested. The SMK, two KV-1, and two T-100 prototypes were sent to Finland during the Winter War and took part in the Battle of Summa. These vehicles formed the 91st Tank Battalion in the 20th Heavy Tank Brigade. The SMK, however, was immobilized by a Finnish anti-tank mine during combat and because of its heavy 55-ton weight, an attempt at recovering the vehicle failed and had to be left behind for two months before Soviet forces could break the Finnish defences to secure it. Before being recovered, the Finnish were able to document and photograph the SMK thoroughly. When German intelligence discovered the SMK, it was designated the ''T-35C'', which caused the misunderstanding that the T-35 also took part in the Winter War when it did not.

The failure of the SMK in the Winter War in contrast to the success of the KV-1 prototypes caused the KV-1 design to be accepted into service on December 19, 1939, as the Soviet's main heavy tank. The SMK thus never reached pass the development stage and was left with only one prototype produced.

The SMK heavy tank was designed and built at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad. In January, 1939 work began on building the tank itself, and the SMK's first test trip around the factory courtyard took place on April 30, 1939. After getting broken in at the factory, the tank was sent to testing grounds, where it underwent testing beginning on the night of July 31 and ending on August 1. Only one model was ever built. It was used in the Finnish War.
