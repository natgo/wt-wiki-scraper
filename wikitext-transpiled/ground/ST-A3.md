== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the third and last finished prototype for the [[Type 61]]. Being part of the second phase of development for the Type 61, together with the ST-A4 it overcame the transmission problems the ST-A1/2 had, and the overall vehicle design was pretty much the same as the final production model. While the ST-A4 was a later prototype, it was completed earlier than the ST-A3, and due to the ease of manufacturing and enlarged cupola became the basis for the Type 61 MBT. This left the ST-A3 behind as a promising prototype incorporating an autoloader.

The ST-A3 was introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]]. While very similar to the final product being the [[Type 61]] MBT, it comes with a 6-second autoloader with a first-stage of 11 shells, which makes it essentially a Type 61 with a 1-second faster reload regardless of crew damage. For tank combat, the ST-A3 in War Thunder has a commander cupola that is less at risk of being hit due to its small profile, the machine gun coming with a gun shield offers some spalling protection to the HMG and offers slightly higher elevation making for a better anti-air defense.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick while tracks are 20 mm thick.

Due to its weak armour nearly every tank is a serious threat to the ST-A3, as well as a number of SPAA vehicles, however fast medium tanks such as the [[T-44]], [[M46]]/[[M47]] Patton or [[Panther II]] which can match its mobility are a painful to avoid, while anything with heavy armour ([[T29]], [[T32]], [[T34]] and [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]]s) forces the reliance on the M431 shell HEAT-FS to punch through frontally, requiring multiple shots to overcome.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 4 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 11 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 1 - 2 - 3.
* If you pack 20&nbsp;''(+20)'' shells, it will keep most of the hull empty of ammo.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-3 into rack 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

[[File:ST-A3 (1).png|420px|thumb]]
As the last built ST-A project (ST-A4 was completed earlier) before it resolved into the [[Type 61]], the ST-A3 shouldn't come as a surprise as to how similar it is to its end-product. While the turret has a different commander cupola and a .50 gun shield; the main surprise of this prototype lies in its auto-loader. Ramming shells into the breech with a 6-second reload, it achieves a faster reload rate compared to all its other brothers in pursuit to become the [[Type 61]] and even overcome the [[Type 61]] as it would adopt from the ST-A4 which would have more ammo load and be a less expensive tank to produce.

Because of this addition of an auto-loader, it still plays very similar to a [[Type 61]] with a constant reload rate of 6 seconds, regardless of crew status unless the auto-loader rack of 11 rounds is empty. The ST-A3 has excellent horizontal traverse and gun depression combined with a fairly mobile chassis, making it a good choice for progressing from turret down, to hull down and firing at the opposition before retreating back to turret down cover.

Its mobility is quite good at getting it to position, where it can ambush tanks early in the game or change position when required, particularly when disengaging when its position is discovered.

Its lack of armour and the decent but not overwhelmingly powerful gun means it is not a wonderful frontline tank to hold a defensive position when the opposition knows its position, as its armour is unlike to prevent any opposition rounds from penetrating and dealing damage, leaving the user to more often than not, rely on luck when engaging opposition frontally.

The biggest issue with the [[Type 61 (Family)]] is shot selection; Should one choose the M431 shell HEAT-FS which will punch through most opposition tanks, but do little damage? Or use the M318A1 AP round, M82 shot APHE rounds for more damage, but will struggle to penetrate opposition frontally at times?

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 6 second autoloader, compared to the 7.5 second ace reload on any other [[Type 61 (Family)|ST-A]] or [[Type 61]]
* Fast turret rotation
* Excellent gun depression
* Good forward speed and mobility
* Good acceleration
* Shell choice:
** Great post-penetration damage on the M82 APCBC shell
** High penetration M431 HEAT-FS shell for tougher targets
* Smaller cupola profile in exchange for a slightly more noticeable .50 gunshield compared to the [[Type 61]] tank

'''Cons:'''

* 90 mm Type 61 cannon can struggle to overcome certain opposing tanks frontally without relying on M431 HEAT-FS shell
* Very thin overall armour, any tank gun will make short work of the ST-A3, and even certain SPAAs can give the tank trouble
* The reverse speed of -8 km/h can hinder the tank at times
* Outer rear part of the engine deck prevent the gun from depressing
* Tall profile due to the gunshield covering the top .50 cal - taller than the Type 61

{{main|Type 61 (Family)|l1=History of the Type 61 MBT}}

Following Japan's remilitarization in the wake of the outbreak of the Korean War, Japanese engineers began working on the first domestic postwar tank designs. Taking on board the experience of working with American WWII tanks in service at the time, as well as incorporating some of the lessons learned from the Korean conflict, Japanese tank designers came up with a series of prototypes in the late 1950s.

The ST-A3 was created as one of the later prototypes and was based on the previous design - the ST-A2. Featuring a 90 mm cannon coupled with an autoloading mechanism in the rear of the turret, the design was considered successful, but ultimately wasn't ordered into production due to concerns over its cost. As a result, the ST-A3 was modified into the ST-A4 by having its autoloading mechanism removed and eventually entered production as the Type 61 medium tank in 1961.

Only two ST-A3 prototypes were constructed and closely resembled the later production model Type 61 visually.
