== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is the prototype of the [[Type 74]], which was developed shortly after the introduction of the [[Type 61]]. Due to Japan’s late entry into post-war tank development, they were behind by one tank generation and had to compare their Type 61s to more advanced tanks such as the [[T-62]]s, [[M60]]s and [[Leopard 1]]s. To keep up with these advancements, Japan sought to upgrade their tanks with the primary goal of incorporating the new standard [[L7 (105 mm) (Family)|L7 rifled cannon]]. 

It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]] along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree. Although the STB-1 has considerably more armor than its counterparts, such as the [[Leopard 1]] and [[AMX-30 (Family)|early AMX-30s]], and has comparable mobility, it is not recommended for use as a front-line tank. Instead, it is best to employ a cautious hit-and-run tactic similar to that used with Leopards. Proper use of the tank’s [[hydropneumatic suspension]] can improve its depression and, in some cases, aid in survivability. Additionally, the STB-1 is equipped with a laser rangefinder, giving it superior long-range capabilities over other tanks of its rank. This allows it to be highly accurate with low-velocity HESH or quickly acquire target range with APDS.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Notes''':

* Hull floor empty: 16&nbsp;''(+34)'' shells
* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 3 and 4 are first stage ammo racks. They total 15 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 1 - 2.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammunition from rack 1 then 2 into ready rack 4 then 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The STB-1 can be compared to the [[Leopard I]] or even a stock [[Leopard A1A1]], but has its own capabilities in its own right. The STB-1 allows for both a more held down playstyle or aggressive playstyle versus the Leopard I due to its [[Hydropneumatic suspension|hydropneumatic suspension]] and two-plane stabilizer. Together with the power of the engine outfitted on the STB-1, allows it to speedily move to a nice sniper spot or hull-down position and fire at targets before they realize a tank could be there.

The STB-1 possesses a pretty nice angled upper front plate, but do keep in mind that the STB-1 wasn't designed to take a punch, only to deal a punch, so even with the good angle you shouldn't rely too heavily on it, as shells can penetrate it and won't always bounce off. Do keep this fully in mind especially when taking more shells with the vehicle, as the fuel tank next to the driver will be filled with extra shells, which can blow up the whole tank if a shell does eventually penetrate.

With the addition of a 12.7 mm machine gun, the STB-1 can make short work of ZSU's or light tanks alike if the heat of the battle doesn't allow for the main gun or in-case of more important targets requiring the main gun's firepower.

With only 2 shells to choose from being APDS & HESH, APDS can be used for long-distance engagements and HESH can deal with light to medium armoured vehicles with overpressure damage, this can be done at a long range once the laser rangefinder has been unlocked as well. But due to the low velocity of the HESH round it has to be fired at a stationary target at long range to effectively hit.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 105 mm L7 cannon found on other NATO tanks
* 12.7 mm Browning M2HB machine gun
* Two-plane stabilizer that allows it to fire on the move
* Highly mobile
* Armour may bounce APHE shells
* Low profile
* Utilization of [[hydropneumatic suspension]] allows for various offensive and defensive options
* Laser rangefinder

'''Cons:'''

* Some areas are lightly armoured, vulnerable to high penetrating SPAAs
* Poor gun elevation angle

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The prototype for the Type 74. Known in Japanese as 74式戦車の試作車STB-1 (ななよんしきせんしゃのしさくしゃSTB-1). Created in September 1969 along with STB-2 in the STT program. Due to issues with cost effectiveness these two prototypes were not considered for the replacement of the Type 61. In a bid to reduce costs STB-3, STB-4, STB-5 and STB-6 were produced between April 1970 to December 1971. The final judgement for the STT program was held in November 1973 which lead the line to be completed in 1974. And, production started the following year in 1975 for the [[Type 74]].
