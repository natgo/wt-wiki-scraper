== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour on the SU-100P is mediocre except against low-calibre machine guns. Due to being an open vehicle, any tank with machine guns is able to kill the crew (with exception of the driver). This has its benefits as it is considered a "glass cannon with paper armour", meaning it barely has armour but said armour is thin enough to not trigger APHE fuses or create any sort of spalling at all, making the survivability of the SU-100P an unreliable armour yet effective in some cases. The main issues with the tank's survivability are front shots. Rounds fired at the hull will not only destroy engine but will create enough spalling to take a considerable amount of crew members, not only the driver but also the loaders. The crew on the turret are somewhat safe due to the high elevation. This is also an issue as the spalling can over penetrate and hit the ammo rack which is located at the back of the tank. Side shots, on the other hand, will only take the engine, lit the tank on fire and kill the driver if the round is fired at the center of mass of the hull, leaving the turret fully operational. Due to the construction of the turret, most front shots will take 2 crew members at most (commander and a loader or gunner and a loader). Front shots (unless they are at an angle) will not disable your breech most of the times, side shots will destroy the breech and take the two turret members. Due to the way the turret is arranged, most of the players will kill your commander trying to disable your gunner (as gunner in most tanks is located at the left side of the turret if seen from the front, in this case the gunner is at the right side of the turret if seen from the front) leaving them defenceless while they reload and retreat and only being able to fire machine guns but the armour is enough to stop machine gun fire.

One of the most noticeable double-edged swords is the turret rotation mechanism. Due to being a manual guidance, the turret rotation and gun elevation is really slow but due to this, the SU-100P will not be affected if the tank loses all of its power compared to the rest of the tanks which have a hydraulic assisted rotation, this is an advantage if the engine is taken out.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, gun shield, gun mantlet)
* Structural steel (gun breech, gun mount)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick while tracks are 15 mm thick.
* Bottom of the hull is 6 mm thick.
* The engine is placed in front of the vehicle and can absorb shots to some extent.

The armour on the SU-100P is best described as non-existent and although it may sometimes not trigger APHE fuses it would be unwise to rely on it in any way especially since most of your crew is exposed to MG fire and overpressure mechanics.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} has good mobility with a top speed of 70 km/h on a flat road capable of getting you into good firing positons early-on in the battle. It does benefit from neutral steering when idling but not while on the move (the unsollicited track just locks, making it more difficult to turn as you lose speed). The reverse speed is good enough to enable you to disengage easily and play peek-a-boo with the enemy.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|D-50 (100 mm)}}

The main gun is a 100 mm rifled D-50 cannon, almost identical to the D-10T of the [[T-44-100]] and [[T-54 (1947)|T-54]]/[[T-55A|55]] only with a higher velocity. The armament is very powerful for its BR but lacks a fully traversable turret.

The open configuration of the turret gives the 100 mm an impressive 7.5 seconds reload time with an upgraded crew.

==== Ammunition ====
The main ammunition of the SU-100P is the BR-412 with the BR-412D variant being the most deadly with the best penetration values especially at longer distances and with only a smaller TNT filler (93.94g equivalent) compared to the BR-412B (100.1g).

The 3D3 smoke round can be used to provide cover for your team and block the enemy's line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The SU-100P is never to be played as a frontline vehicle as the open hull structure is the main weakness which will make enemy team get a free kill by just using their machine guns, this is why the SU-100P should perform the support role. Support role has a wide variety of tactics and course of action, going from a simple cap defender to the enemy's worst flanking nightmare. The tank is one of the most agile, versatile and fast tanks at the battle rating with a really powerful cannon, able to knock out practically any vehicle it faces, most of them even frontally.

'''As a sniper:'''

As expected, the SU-100P has no place in the frontlines and thus it must be used as a support vehicle. Its high speed, relatively low profile, and powerful gun make it one of the best "Hit N' Run" snipers in the BR. This means the SU-100P should stay at a spot, strike as much as possible and relocate in order to avoid detection and enemy engagements. It is not to be used as an extreme long range sniper as it lacks high velocity ammunition (APCR or APDS) and powerful zoom optics (only x8).

'''As a flanker:'''

Whenever the situation feels like being an urban map, a closed and tight spaced place, etc, the SU-100P has all the requirements of being an amazing flanker specially when facing the sluggish and slow German and British tanks such as the [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther]] and [[Centurion (Family)|Centurion]]. Be aware as the SU-100P has no machine guns or smoke grenades, it has a relatively slow reload speed and it is not able to strike as fast if tanks are aware of your presence. Due to the fast speed, it is able to poke-fire-retreat as many times as needed in a continuous way with relative high frequency.

'''Arcade mode'''

Since many opponents will see the SU-100P immediately due to Arcade markers, it is necessary to either avoid general sightlines or use cover and/or solid sight obstructions to shield the SU-100P from immediate destruction. Whenever you have to leave the cover to move, aim the gun in direction of the presumable enemy position, as otherwise they will machine gun the entire crew in a single swipe. The constant airstrikes of AB will likely destroy the SU-100P, as players tend to aim for vulnerable tanks or for the tanks of the top players on the enemy team. In the case if you match both criteria the entire enemy team might just focus on strafing your tank and there isn't much you can do, but try to destroy every fighter on the enemy team by calling one yourself. For the same reason, the SU-100P is not easy to use in a losing team or as a third tank in a lineup.

The stock performance of the SU-100P is not enough to get into position fast or fight most opponents fair and square, so more obscure arcade aim assist functions should be abused. For example, it is possible to fire through many buildings with kinetic shells, and with high keen vision it is possible to find enemy tanks and briefly mark them while standing behind a house. After that, even though the SU-100P can't scout and make markers remain active for a while, it still can select the tank and fire at its silhouette into presumable weak part semi-blindly before it disappeared. Generally, enemies do not expect such trickery and do not respond to such shots, because they do not see who fires at them, or because they use HEAT projectiles and can't fire through obstacles, or even do not understand how that works. Even though this strategy is only available on certain maps, it can allow for some RP gain to unlock the best shell, which can penetrate most down-tier tanks head-on, including panthers, without much issue.

After gaining some upgrades to douse fires, increase accuracy and penetrate its opponents easier, the SU-100P can imitate the [[YaG-10 (29-K)]]'s playstyle by firing broadside to the right, as many opponents will either hit the engine, which shields the driver, or hit one or several of the turret crew members. For better results, some temporary cover can be chosen as to avoid being fired at by an entire squad and to disallow better players to hit the ammo rack directly, as it could easily happen with aim assist on. After the mobility upgrades were unlocked, the SU-100P can finally flank like a light tank and play super aggressively, as often it only loses non-critical crew when first shot. The rest is up to luck, as each shot can end the SU-100P or do almost nothing depending on enemy aim quality and ammo choice.

'''List of opponents important notes when facing frontally:'''

* [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther]]/[[M48 Patton (Family)|M48]]/[[M26 (Family)|Pershing]]: all front can be penetrated with BR-412D
* [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]]: gun mantlet can be penetrated by BR-412D, hull is impenetrable (aim at the left side of the turret to take gunner, commander and possibly breech. Aim at right side of the turret if the tank is facing at you for a safe reload as this will take his loader out in case he fired)
* [[Centurion (Family)|Centurion]]: all front can be penetrated with BR-412D
* [[Jagdtiger]]: everything except lower frontal plate is impenetrable
* [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]]/[[AMX-30 (Family)|AMX-30]]: all front can be penetrated with BR-412D and higher penetration rounds
* [[T95]]: gun mantlet and hull are impenetrable, cupolas can be penetrated with APHE

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Hard-hitting and accurate gun
* Reloads as fast or faster than the 85 mm, while using the 100 mm gun
* Decently mobile hull, reasonably high average and maximum speed when spaded (same as on the [[Object 120]] but without the extra weight of the turret)
* It has a turret unlike other SU SPGs, although it can only turn 77 degrees in either side and will not save from a flank by itself
* Very stable hull, shooting on the move and while stopping is easy
* Low silhouette
* Can fight like [[YaG-10 (29-K)]] to prolong its existence for as long as possible if enemy only uses kinetic shells
* There is no reason to not take full ammo load, since if its ammo rack was hit the situation was already unsalvageable

'''Cons:'''

* Any shell capable of overpressure damage will annihilate it in one hit, and many tanks at a BR range have HEAT as their top (or even only) shell
* Crew is exposed to MG fire even from the front due to a poorly placed gun shield, tank can be strafed from the sky with no effort
* Sometimes, APHE hitting the gun shield will detonate the ammo rack as well
* Gun traverse is very slow
* Really awful stock performance, it needs every single upgrade to be good at combat

The SU-100P was a project for an artillery piece in 1945 as well as provide anti-armour capabilities and counter battery (against enemy artillery positions). The main objective was to make it capable of destroying enemies with direct fire. As Europe and the United States were developing Self Propelled Howitzers (SPH) which could fire at close positions and relocate with speed, this was a big concern as towed artilleries were being removed and counter battery started to become a harder task. The Russian artilleries at the time did not have the enough gun elevation to accurately provide artillery support even with towed guns, thus, the main focus was to create a gun which had almost a +40° elevation. The gun chosen for it was the D-50 100 mm rifled bore cannon, a derivation from the widely used D-10 100 mm cannon, the main gun used on the SU-100 tank destroyer.

The SU-100P chassis with this turret configuration proved a wide variety of errors and it never saw mass production but it was the base of many prototype and serviced vehicles at the time, pre Cold War and during Cold War, this being the following:

* SU-152 "Taran" SPG (Object 120)
* SU-152P SPH
* ZSU-37-2 SPAA
* 2S3 Akatsiya SPH
* 2S4 Tyulpan SPH
* 1K17 Szhaite SPL
* 2K11 Krug SAM
* 2K10 Ladoga TBMC
