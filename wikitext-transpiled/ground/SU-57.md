== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"]]. The vehicle is similar to the American [[M3 GMC|75 mm GMC M3]] by mounting a gun on the back of a half-track. The 57 mm gun can nearly penetrate most tanks at its battle rating range, nearly 100 mm at 500 meters away with regular AP rounds.

The most distinctive feature of this vehicle is its gun. Armed with very accurate 57 mm M1 gun with penetration of almost 90 mm on 2000m and fast reload speed, SU-57 is very effective long-range tank destroyer. Aside from that, SU-57 is very mobile, fast and agile. This, however, is vital for its survival as the vehicle basically lacks adequate armour protection. In order to use the SU-57 effectively, it is essential to combine its firepower with its mobility - attack selected targets from distance and be prepared for rapid relocation, as one well-placed enemy shot can tear the vehicle apart. On the other hand, one well-placed shot of the 57mm gun can tear apart almost everything SU-57 encounters, especially when aiming for weak spots.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The SU-57 is an excellent tank destroyer that is capable of effectively and quickly destroying any enemy vehicle, even when in battles several BRs above its own. The 57 mm gun is excellent, and able to quickly deal with any foe you might face. The mobility is technically excellent, with good acceleration and top speed, however there are two issues. Being a half track, the SU-57 steers mostly like a conventional car, which is not ideal for a tank destroyer where the ability to neutral steer is preferable. Additionally the gun has very little depression, and the armour is only resistant to rifle-calibre rounds. These features mean that the SU-57 must seek to get the first shot on enemies. While rushing can be tempting, it will take a long time to get the gun on target when coming to a stop, so it is best to remain stationary when near enemy vehicles. Ambush tactics are very effective with this vehicle, as it is able to quickly reach good locations and deal damage effectively.

'''Close Range Engagements:'''

The SU-57 struggles at close range due to its limited turret rotation and half track steering. It is best to avoid close range engagements as it will be difficult to get the gun on target, and most enemies will be able to quickly disable the SU-57 due to its lack of armour.

'''Long Range Engagements:'''

The SU-57 does well at long range due to the quick reload, high penetration, and high velocity of its main gun. However, SU-57 players should not stay in the exact same spot for too long, as once the enemy vehicles have found the right firing solution, the SU-57 will not last long.

'''Arcade Battles:'''

In Arcade battles, the SU-57 will not generally do well. This is because in Arcade, the enemy will have a much easier time spotting and getting a good shot on the SU-57. Ambush tactics are not viable in Arcade, and the high speed nature of Arcade will pose a big challenge for the limited turret traverse of the SU-57.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Accurate and powerful gun capable of penetration even on vast distances
* Can destroy basically everything it encounters very easily
* Great mobility and speed of the half-track vehicle compared to tanks
* Ability to snipe from distance and relocate quickly if needed
* Enemy shells often fly through its thin armour without dealing any serious damage
* Crew has better protection compared to the American [[M3 GMC|75 mm M3 GMC]]

'''Cons:'''

* Lack of armour protection - vulnerable even to machine gun fire
* Vulnerable to shrapnel and artillery shelling due to its open top
* Rather limited gun arc
* Cannot turn on one spot as tracked SPG can due to its half-track configuration

== History ==

===Development===
The '''SU-57''' began as the ''T48 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage'' from the United States. This is similar to their previous anti-tank vehicle the [[M3 GMC|75 mm GMC M3]], which mounted a 75 mm M1897A4 gun instead. The development started from a British and American requirement for a vehicle mounting the 6-pounder gun. This was fulfilled with the 57 mm gun M1 (A US version of the 6-pounder) and this was installed on the rear of an M3 Half-track. Orders came in at April 1942, but the Americans soon drop theirs after the [[M10 GMC|M10 GMC]] was put into production. Thus, the T48 was to be lend-leased to Allied countries and was never classified in the American inventory.

The vehicle was tested at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in May 1942 and was upgraded along the way with new mounting and recoil mechanism. A gun shield with 5/8 inches of armour on the front and 1/4 inch armour on the sides and top provided protection for the crew but was relatively low in height. The employment of the 75 mm GMC M3 had the T48 equipped with headlights that were demountable. The vehicle was approved for production in 1942 and was built until 1943 with 962 vehicles produced total.

===Combat usage===
The vehicle was delivered to the British and the Soviet Union as part of the Lend-Lease Act. The British were to use it in the Western Desert Campaign around Egypt and Libya, but the victory was achieved before the vehicles could arrive and do anything. After that, the 57 mm gun on the T48 was being superseded by the 75 mm gun from the US and the 17-pounder from the British. The T48 became surplus in British inventory and some were shipped to the Soviet Union as aid as well. The T48 in Soviet service was called '''SU-57''' (Samokhodnaya ustanovka 57 - Self-propelled gun 57) and they received about 650 units in the course of the war. Some went to the Polish People's Army as well. Aside from that, British and Americans still retained several T48s but were all converted back into regular M3 Half-track carriers except for one in 1944. The German Wehrmacht also operated a few T48 as Half-track carriers due to being captured by the British and Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union employed the weapon most notably in their Summer 1944 offensive Operation Bagration. It was widely used by the Soviet 16th Separate Tank Destroyer Brigade in 1943 at the Dnieper River and the 19th Brigade in 1944 at the Baranow bridgehead. These vehicles would continue to serve in various units up until the Berlin and Prague offensives into Germany and Poland. They were allocated to 60 vehicles per brigade and the SU-57s were used as mobile fire support for the infantry due to their mobility. The 57 mm proved very well in this role as it could effectively hide behind a hill and fire from a long range due to the 57 mm gun.

A self-propelled artillery/anti-tank mount based on the M3 semitrack transporter. Its weapons system included a six-pound British anti-tank cannon. The entire project was completed based on an order by Great Britain in 1942. The SPG was released between December 1942 and May 1943. In the end, Great Britain determined that the project was unnecessary, so this mount was used most widely in the USSR, where most of the SPGs produced were provided as part of the lend-lease program.
