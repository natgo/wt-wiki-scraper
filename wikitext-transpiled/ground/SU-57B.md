== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]].

This tank destroyer uses a 57 mm ZIS-4 for its main gun. It features a low profile, good top speed (40 km/h in RB) and great penetration for its rank, but weak armour at all angles.

The overall design of the SU-57B allows for sneaky attacks, revolving around the 57 mm ZiS-4 gun that allows for engagement from medium range on unsuspecting enemies. Because of its low profile, this TD can use bushes and terrain to hide its approach. However, the trade-off is lacklustre mobility, so it compares with the ZiS-30 that provides better mobility and speed and can reposition much faster. Despite all these limitations, when played right the SU-57B can score good scores, but only when properly positioned and not detected.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The SU-57B has the best armour on the front, weaker armour on the sides and on the rear. Regarding the crew protection, because of the number of crew members (4), the loss of 1 or 2 crew members is acceptable. But due to the thin armour, the SU-57B can take one or two shots maximum before being put out of order. It is much better protected than the ZiS-30 and can sustain MG fire.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour

* Belly armour is 6 mm thick.
* Suspension wheels are 10 mm thick while tracks are 15 mm thick.

{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 148|rbMinHp= 92}}

The {{PAGENAME}} is sluggish at backwards speed and will have a hard time countering an opponent attempting a flanking manoeuvre. The best bet is to retreat and relocate when spotted. Fortunately, thanks to its great forward speed (43 km/h maximum), the {{PAGENAME}} can still move quite easily.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|ZIS-4 (57 mm)}}

The main gun is ridiculously powerful for its hull. It features a ZIS-4 57 mm that has a penetration rate similar to the ZiS-30 main gun. The position of the main gun is quite low and enemies will have a hard time detecting the silhouette of the tank. However, because of its long barrel, one must be careful not to stand out from cover or from the sides.

The recoil of the gun can be important and must be taken care of, as well as the dispersion effect. The relatively fast reloading rate of 5.6 seconds allows for a comfortable targeting and efficiency. Though, with the SU-57B able to hold a total of 72 rounds of ammunition, the SU-57B can shoot more freely without worry. However, keep in mind the 5.6 second initial reload time can feel quite long when facing an opponent at close range where some tanks can fire almost twice before you can shoot again

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The SU-57B is a lightly armoured tank destroyer, armed with a deadly 57 mm ZiS-4 anti-tank gun that is not a threat to take lightly for most enemy vehicles at its BR, though being a lightly armoured vehicle it can prove to be a very difficult vehicle to master at first. But even with its light armour it got a useful acceleration and top speed makes it a opponent to be wary against. A well placed or hidden SU-57B can with ease prove to be a great obstacle for the enemy armoured units.

A key element to the SU-57B being used successfully is distance to enemy targets and element of surprise, the ZiS-4 is a gun that can attack most vehicles at any distance on the field, with a powerful and fast firing 57 mm long barrel it can ambush from distance as from close range. Why distance is a key for the Su-57B is its lack of armour, being 25 mm frontally thick but at an angle that gives it an effective armour of 32 mm makes it an easy target for most vehicles it will face. At a distance it has a higher possibility to survive a hit and maintain a distance to enemy 12.7 mm machine guns, but the armor still should not be relied on at all.

Ground units are one of the SU-57B's least worries, enemy air units can easily target the SU-57B from above, having a light top armour makes most machine gun fire and cannon fire from planes a lethal threat. Lacking a anti-air machine gun on it, makes it hard for it to defend itself against air units. Hiding in forests or bushes are a way for it to defend itself form aircrafts.  Protection against air can also be near allied SPAA vehicles.

Enemies to be aware of are mostly light tanks that can easily flank it such as the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]] and [[M5A1]]. SPAA like the [[M15 CGMC]] or [[Wirbelwind]] will have an easy time destroying the light armour.  But most important of all is that it's extremely vulnerable to any air attack against it, you can with ease prevent ground units to get into a effective range, Air units can attack from anywhere and easily make scrap metal out of the SU-57B

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent top forward speed
* Excellent 57 mm ZIS-4 gun which provides the necessary firepower to deal with almost all ground vehicles at its battle rating
* Very low profile ideal for sneak attacks and sniper attacks, similar to ASU-57
* Relatively fast reload speed for a tank destroyer at 5.6 seconds stock and 4.3 seconds aced
* Low visibility percentage at 69% compared to most TDs at the battle rating (~88%)
* 38 degree frontal armor slope can somewhat hold off autocannon fire at range

'''Cons:'''

* Sluggish acceleration
* Very weak rear speed
* Poor turning ability, don't expect to be able to pivot quickly
* Weak armour susceptible to any type of damage, even heavy MGs can take it out with ease
* Crammed crew space will nearly guarantee atleast 2 crew members being knocked out from a single penetrating shot

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In 1943 the MVTU USSR design bureau proposed an 11 ton tank hunter prototype with two main gun variants:

# The 75 mm S-1 main gun
# The 57 mm S-1-57 main gun

Both would be propelled with a diesel GMC-71 engine.

At the same moment, the GAZ design bureau was working on 2 designs. One named "GAZ-74b" which is the SU-57B with a long barrel, and an improved version with a 76 mm gun. The Su-57a was to be the tank hunter with the 76mm main gun. The Su-57B was not accepted for service because it was too costly pro produce and because of its newer diesel engine.

Later the GAZ-74d (SU-76d) would come out with a 76 mm S-1 main gun and a frontal armour of 60 mm. It will also be known later as "SU-80".
