== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (not to be confused with the [[SU-76M]]) was a proposed Soviet tank destroyer that was based on the chassis of the T-70 light tank. As the name suggests, it was powered by a 110 hp diesel engine. It was following the idea of light tank destroyers, which were small, mobile, and designed for quick strikes with a powerful gun. However, it failed to meet two of the criteria, as the {{Specs|name}}'s main armament was a 76.2 mm gun, the same as that found on early T-34s, but it was no longer powerful enough to pierce the armour of more advanced German tanks, and the engine's power was insufficient for the vehicle. On top of that, the vehicle had problems with fine-tuning of the domestic engine. Thus, all work on it was halted, and the {{Specs|name}} was never mass produced.

The {{Specs|name}} was introduced during [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7107-event-future-technology-en|Future Technology]] event. It is a small, light, and agile tank destroyer, but it falls short in terms of armour protection, and only has average mobility. Its BR-530B shell allows it to penetrate and deal devastating damage to the most common enemies at its battle rating, making it an ideal vehicle for rather sneaky gameplay.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The SU-76D has almost no armour to speak of, and can only survive one or two shells before getting knocked out. Because of this, it should be played like a light tank. Also, its roof armour is enough for .50 cal machine guns to penetrate. Luckily it has a relatively low profile so getting hit is a bit harder, and it can sustain small-calibre MG fire.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, casemate)
* Cast homogeneous armour (cupola)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and torsion bars are 10 mm thick while tracks are 15 mm thick.
* Belly armour is 6 mm thick.
* There is a 15 mm internal plate separating the crew compartment from the engine compartment.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

'''Notes:'''

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* If you pack 16&nbsp;''(+55)'' shells, it will keep most of the casemate empty of ammo.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful 76.2 mm F-34 cannon against common enemies like [[Pz.IV C]], [[M5A1]], [[Chi-Ha Kai]] 
* ±13° horizontal gun traverse is good, so the tank doesn't need to constantly adjust its hull to aim 
* APCR can effectively penetrate heavier targets like [[B1 ter]] and [[M4A3 (105)]] 
* Has a small profile, harder to be seen and hit 

'''Cons:'''

* Virtually no armour, can only stop low-caliber gunfire from tanks like [[Light AA Mk I|Light AA]]
* -5° gun depression is not enough to fight on slopes
* Low reverse speed won't allow quick retreat
* Substandard engine power results in sluggish mobility on hills and loose surface
