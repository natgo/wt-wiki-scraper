== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The Sd.Kfz.222 is overall a poorly protected vehicle. 

The frontal hull consists of 14-30 mm armour plates, which can only stop heavy machine gun rounds and, with good angling, non-HVAP autocannon shells. Thus vehicles with heavy machine guns or autocannons are highly dangerous, for example [[M13 MGMC]], [[Pz.II (Family)|Pz.II]], [[Sd.Kfz.234/1]], etc. Any projectile with a larger calibre will go through its armour with ease. The rest of the vehicle is covered in 8 mm plates, which are barely enough to stop rifle-calibre bullets. At point blank range, even rifle-calibre machine guns have a good chance of penetrating the Sd.Kfz.222. The thin armour also makes the vehicle highly vulnerable to shrapnel from bombs and near-miss high explosive shells, so stay away from diving planes or artillery strikes. 

The post-penetration survivability is low. There are only 3 crews, with 2 sitting closely together in the turret making them easy to be taken out by a single shot. However, the vehicle will sometimes survive a shot or two, but don't count on that. The open-topped turret also makes HE, HEAT, bombs, and explosive rockets very lethal due to their overpressure. Therefore, the Sd.Kfz.222 will be knocked out with a single shot from howitzer-equipped vehicles like the [[M8 HMC (China)|M8 HMC]], the [[Chi-Ha]], or the [[15cm sIG 33 B Sfl]].

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The Sd.Kfz.222 is a highly mobile vehicle, so the player should utilise this trait and avoid the flaws in protection.

On flat paved road, the vehicle can quickly accelerate to around 60 km/h thanks to its 18 hp/t power-to-weight ratio. This speed is comparable with famous fast tanks like [[BT-5]]. In offroad conditions, the vehicle can still maintain an average speed of around 50 km/h, allowing it to get to any location in a timely manner.

The -16 km/h reverse speed seems significantly lower than forward speed, but it is fast enough to pull the vehicle out of danger if it is not far from a cover behind. Other wise, it may be better to turn the vehicle around. 

The vehicle's 4 wheels can all steer, making it very agile to navigate through confined environments like a small town, or to quickly change driving directions. 

The only flaw in mobility is that, at high speed, it is awkward to precisely control the direction as the vehicle tend to "snake" around when trying to steer. Also, it takes a few seconds to fully come to a halt when braking at high speed. Lastly, due to the vehicle's light weight (only 5t), it cannot quickly ram through obstacles like metal fences without losing speed, so avoid driving into them.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|KwK30 (20 mm)}}

The Sd.Kfz.222 is armed with a single 20 mm KwK30 autocannon paired with a coaxial rifle-calibre machine gun. The Sd.Kfz.222 possesses a quick turret traverse and elevation speeds, and can elevate its gun to 80 degrees, allowing you to aim at and track aircraft with comfort. Compared to its German counterpart, the 20 mm KwK30 autocannon fires at a slower rate than the KwK38, but has double the ammunition per magazine. The KwK30 doesn't have access to the PzGr.40 belt, which grants it a higher penetration. This is a bigger disadvantage than one might expect, and limits the Chinese Sd.Kfz.222 more to its stated role as SPAA, especially in uptiers. Against many of its contemporaries, however, the penetration at point blank should be enough to deal with armoured cars and light tanks. There is more bullet drop on the KwK30 than the KwK38 autocannon, but the low penetration means it shouldn't be used to snipe, and it is not noticeable enough to really affect anti-air performance.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High speed especially on paved road, comparable with fast foes like [[BT-5]]
* All-wheel steering, very agile navigating through urban areas
* Fast turret traverse, can keep up with high-speed targets like planes
* Good -16km/h reverse speed, helpful to retreat from danger
* 20-round magazine is beginner friendly
* Very small profile, easy to hide in bushes

'''Cons:'''

* No HVAP shells unlike the [[Sd.Kfz.222|German version]], cannot penetrate armoured targets like [[H.39]], [[D2]], etc
* Very poorly protected, even a heavy machine gun can frontally penetrate it
* 7-second reload is quite slow
* 280 rounds/min fire rate is slower than the German version, requiring extra aiming skills to hit planes
