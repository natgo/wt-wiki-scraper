== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Armour protection is, mediocre, to say the least. Almost the entire car is comprised of 8 mm sloped steel plates, which is barely enough to stop normal 7.62 mm AP bullets. HMGs and autocannons will be your biggest pain as they will easily shred your car up from any angle. In fact, if aimed at precisely from certain angles the 8 mm of armour can be pierced by the larger coaxial MGs, such as British BESAs, Swedish 8 mm MGs and even your own 7.92 MG34s (this can be a rare occurrence, but don't discount it). Only the front of the car, with a 30 mm radiator housing and 14.5 mm front plate, can offer protection against rifle-calibre fire, but anything bigger than that will basically fling you back to the garage. The open turret also means that chemical shells (i.e. HE, HEAT and the HESH round from the Lancia 3ro) are an instant death even if they miss; avoid them at all times.

'''Armour type:'''

'''Notes:'''

* Mudguards and stowage boxes are 4 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Sd.Kfz.222 moves rapidly on roads, less so on regular ground and will get bogged down in soft terrain. It is easy to control at speed and can engage enemies quickly since it needs little time to come to a full stop.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:''' 

* Fast and nimble
* 20 mm autocannon has a fast rate of fire
* 20 mm HVAP rounds have a high penetration
* The thin armour on the sides and rear mean that most APHE rounds will go right through without activating the fuse

'''Cons:'''

* The 20 mm cannon belt consists of only 10 rounds and it gets exhausted very quickly, so reloads are very frequent
* Weak armour from the sides and rear can be penetrated by lighter weapons like autocannons and heavy machine guns (e.g. [[M13 MGMC]], [[GAZ-AAA (DShK)]])
* Can be destroyed with overpressure by chemical rounds and artillery strikes
* Poor post-penetration damage of 20 mm shells means that it can be difficult to destroy spacious tanks like the [[LVT(A)(1)]]
* Tall wire mesh fencing on the turret sides can give it away if attempting to hide or play stealthily while providing no armour benefits
* Prone to strafing from aircraft
* Has trouble turning in tight and narrow streets
* The 20 mm autocannon is lacking against heavily armoured enemies
* Both the AP and HVAP rounds' penetration drop below 30 mm past 500 m, making it struggle to penetrate common opponents past that distance

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
From 1935 to 1944, Nazi Germany produced a series of light armoured reconnaissance four-wheel drive armoured cars known as the Leichter Panzerspähwagen. Sd.Kfz. 222 (also known as Leichter Panzerspähwagen 2 cm) is the second variant in the Leichter Panzerspähwagen series, equipped with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a single MG 13 machine gun.

=== Development ===
The Leichter Panzerspähwagen series was created with reliability, fuel flexibility, simple construction, and off-road capabilities in mind. The Sd.Kfz. 222 utilises one of two conventional four-wheeled armoured car chassis - rear-mounted engine. Eisenwerk Weserhütte of Bad Oeynhausen designed the vehicles, while Horch (Auto Union) of Zwickau built the chassis and F. Schichau of Elbing and Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen of Hanover-Linden assembled them. The engine, which was originally a 3.5 Litre Horch V8, was also upgraded to a 3.8 Litre with 90 PS in 1942. Because of its light weight, the vehicle has a respectable road speed of 80 km/h and a cross-country speed of 40 km/h. Its maximum range was 300 km.

The second variant of the Leichter Panzerspähwagen - Sd.Kfz. 222 has the addition of a gunner increased the crew size to three over the previous variant Sd.Kfz. 221, greatly reducing the commander's stress and responsibility. Several upgrades were made to the Sd.Kfz. 222 between 1937 and late 1943, primarily in terms of firepower; the MG 13 was replaced by an MG 34 in 1938, and the KwK 30 was replaced by the faster-firing KwK 38. (1942). There are at least 990 vehicles produced in all variants.

The vehicle is primarily used by Panzer divisions' reconnaissance battalions (Aufklärungs-Abteilung). While it performed reasonably well in countries with good road networks in Western Europe, it was severely limited by its poor off-road performance on the Eastern Front and in the deserts of the North African campaign.

=== Replacement ===
Due to limitations in firepower and mobility during the Soviet Union invasion in 1941, the Leichter Panzerspähwagen Sd.Kfz. 222 was gradually replaced in the reconnaissance role by the Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track. Soviet designers studied captured Sd.Kfz 222s, which led to the development of the BA-64 light armoured car.
