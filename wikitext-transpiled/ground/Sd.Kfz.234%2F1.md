== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6669-special-space-race-en|"Space Race" event]].

The Sd.Kfz.234/1 combines the familiar chassis of the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]], but with the turret of the [[Sd.Kfz. 140/1]]. While not as heavily armoured as the latter, the mobility presented by the former's chassis gives the Sd.Kfz.234/1 excellent map manoeuvrability to utilise the 20 mm autocannon against unsuspecting opponents.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Vision ports)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Even though the armour of the Sd.Kfz.234/1 is lacking, it can still bounce a hit or two from low-calibre guns from the front if lucky and when played to its advantages it can become a vital part of achieving victory over the other team. This armoured car has two main things going for it: excellent mobility (with max speeds of 90 km/h RB, 100 km/h AB) and a very effective, fast-firing autocannon with Pzgr 40 rounds that have exceptional armour penetration, where it can decimate enemies at both close and medium ranges.

With these advantages in mind, there are several playstyles for this vehicle. The first of these is to play a harasser role. Using the excellent mobility, the Sd.Kfz.234/1 can get to the best positions on the map early and lie in ambush for enemy vehicles. Once you have struck and eliminated an enemy, use the vehicle's mobility to get yourself to a new position and repeat the process.

A second option is to play it so as to get to cap zones before the other teams do, and afterwards use your vehicle as a support tank along with your teammates' tanks taking up a position behind them.

The third option, if playing in a squad (two or more) you can also use this vehicle for flanking operations.

'''Notable opponents''':

* [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1]]'s - Very well armoured for its BR and can be very dangerous (avoid if possible)
* [[T-70]] / [[T-80]] - Strong frontal armour that will be hard to penetrate (but thinner side and rear armour), if you find yourself fighting one of these try to flank its position and catch it off guard.
* [[:Category:USA ground vehicles|USA]] - Most tanks of this tier can be penetrated easily by your autocannon, but be careful as some of these tanks especially BR 3.0 and up will carry .50 cal machine guns which can penetrate your armour so be careful when engaging them. Other nations tanks are relatively similar in their potency, so the same rules should be applied when engaging them.

To conclude, this armoured car is very useful when used in a harasser role, and in the other roles stated above. To make it even more useful, check the specs of other tanks & vehicles of the same BR to get a better idea on what vehicles you can pen and what you can't.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* HVAP belts has a full composition of HVAP, able to penetrate most light tanks (e.g. [[T-26]], [[M3A1 Stuart|M3A1]], [[BT-5|BT-5,]] [[A13 (Family)|A13]]) and side armour of heavier targets (e.g. [[B1 bis|B1]]) easily
* The KwK38 is coupled with an MG42 with a blistering fire rate which allows quite effective suppressive fire capability on light-skinned vehicles
* The 20 mm cannon can shoot down aircraft due to a very high elevation angle which means it can, in a pinch, act as a pseudo-SPAA
* The quick speed (100 km/h in AB, 90 km/h in RB) allows the Sd.Kfz.234/1 to be one of, if not the first vehicle, to both, make contact with the enemy team and capture zones
* Very fast acceleration both forward and reverse, getting out of a sticky situation is very easily if your driver is alive
* It can average around 40 km/h off-road, which is quite fast for a wheeled vehicle
* The front hull and turret have 30 mm of armour which is sloped to increase the thickness
* The thin armour on the sides and rear mean that most solid shot rounds will go right through without causing much damage, which is useful against tanks with only solid shells, like all the [[M3 Stuart (Family)|M3]]/[[M5 Stuart (Family)|M5]] Stuarts

'''Cons:'''

* The 20 mm cannon belt consists of only 10 rounds and it gets exhausted very quickly, so reloads are very frequent
* Weak armour from the sides and rear can be penetrated by lighter weapons like autocannons and machine guns (e.g. [[M13 MGMC]], [[GAZ-AAA (DShK)]])
* Can be destroyed with overpressure by HEAT projectiles like the [[M8 General Scott (Family)|M8 Scott]]
* Poor damage of 20 mm shells means that it can be difficult effectively destroy spacious tanks like the [[LVT(A)(1)]]
* Tall wire mesh fencing on the turret sides can give it away if attempting to hide or play stealthily while providing no armour benefits
* The wheeled suspension makes controlling the vehicle in turns very hard as it has a tendency to drift
* It is a wheeled vehicle so, while being racecar-like on hard surfaces, mud, water, snow and sand really slow it down (to around 20-30 km/h)
* It is open-topped so artillery is deadly and aircraft ramming the vehicle can knock it out
* Turret traverse speed is average, this, coupled with its tendency to drift in turns makes taking out a target after turning quite the chore
* Unlike the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]], the Sd.Kfz.234/1 does not have access to smoke grenades, thus cannot safely retreat from danger
* Ammunition detonations are very frequent

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.
