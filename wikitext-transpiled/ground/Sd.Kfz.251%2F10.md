== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Raining Fire"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6878-event-wargame-strategist-en|2020 Wargame "Strategist" event]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, gun shield)
- Structural steel (mudguards, undercarriage)
- Wheel (front tires)

'''Notes:'''

- As they are modeled by sets of 4, shells disappear from the rack only after you fire all 4 shells in the set.
- Each rack contains 3 sets of 4 shells.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Sd.Kfz.251/10 is a light armored half track with decent mobility, with a quick firing high velocity, but low spalling 37 mm main gun. For these reasons, the Sd.Kfz.251/10 should not be used in the frontlines due to being so lightly armored even against 7.62 mm machine gun fire can and will harm you.

''As a sniper:''

Due to its gun's high muzzle velocity, the {{PAGENAME}} is more than capable of having a sniper combat role in long range maps. It should be noted that the main gun sights have really low zoom (though normal for the BR it sits at), meaning it is not capable of achieving shots at extreme ranges but will dominate the long range engagements like many German high velocity guns.

''As a support vehicle:''

This is the most reliable role the Sd.Kfz.251/10 can play as, especially since not every map the player will have the sniping distances needed (Sweden or Berlin for example). It should be performing support fire from behind the most armored vehicles at the BR (Pz.III for example) and utilize its quick firing gun to disable or destroy enemy tanks. It should be noted that machine gun fire is your worst enemy as:

a) the crew is exposed

b) it is an open top vehicle

c) has little to no armor which can barely stop 7.62 mm at point blank ranges, 12.7 mm (.50 cal) will completely destroy it if strafed with

Due to being a halftrack, the {{PAGENAME}} has superb traction and decent speed compared to fully wheeled vehicles. It is able to move through rough terrain easier than fully wheeled vehicles (snow, sand, mud, etc.) but still somewhat maintain its speed as a wheeled vehicle in urban terrain such as roads, although it will be definitely slower compared to fully wheeled vehicles.

{{Notice|As a half track, the {{PAGENAME}} shares tank track traction but does not share tank steering. The front wheels have to turn like a normal car.}}

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Thin armour, does not trigger most APHE rounds fired at it
- Relatively punchy APCR round and high-velocity
- Very fast reload
- High survivability due to a crew of five

'''Cons:'''

- Relatively bad mobility, especially in mud and snow
- Very thin armour, cannot block heavy machine gunfire
- Open top, weak against planes and machine guns
- Best shell is APCR, which is underwhelming at medium/long ranges
- Gun shield does not do a good job at protecting the gunner
- Gun is centrally located so peeking without exposing the engine is difficult
- Vulnerable to artillery

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Developed on the basis of the unarmored Sd.Kfz.11 halftrack, the Sd.Kfz.251 entered service with the Wehrmacht in 1939 and was intended as the primary transportation vehicle for the Panzergrenadier units of the German army. As such, the vehicle was intended to taxi troops into battle and protect them from small arms fire and shrapnel. By the end of the war, over 15,000 units of the Sd.Kfz.251 were built.

However, platoon leader vehicles received a special upgrade to their firepower in order to increase the effectiveness of fire support provided for advancing infantry. Namely, the standard machine gun mount was replaced by a turret housing a 3.7cm PaK anti-tank cannon. These versions, designated Sd.Kfz. 251/10, served with the Wehrmacht until 1944, by which time over 300 units were built.
