== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Red Skies"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season IV, "Fearless Voltigeur"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The most protected parts of this vehicle are the front-facing plates of the hull and the driver compartment where the armour is the thickest.

The weakest area on the whole tank is the gun shield protecting the cannon's servants. It doesn’t help when 3 out of 5 crew members are behind it. The gunner and loader are next to each other and when a shot hits them, the 4 mm gun shield armour doesn’t protect them from anything other than rifle-calibre gunfire. The ammo stowage positions aren’t bad since they’re right behind the machine gunner and driver which will take all shrapnel from incoming rounds, but can still be easily destroyed.

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, gun shield)
- Wheel (front tires)

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Sd.Kfz.251/22 with its long 75 mm cannon is great for penetrating the heavily armoured vehicles such as the Matilda and KV-1. The infamous T-34s are easy to penetrate and many infamous Russians.

It can't be exposed directly to enemy fire but the vehicle is good for hanging behind larger tanks, assisting with supporting fire.

Use the long range to your advantage, since this tank destroyer was designed to engage tanks from a safe distance. Being on a hill top or across a lake is perfect for this. Always take into account that the light armour is a downisde and you can be destroyed by even light armament aircraft with basic 7.62 mm machineguns, so try to find some cover when planes are around.

There are not many tanks to avoids in the BR for this tank, engaging more than one enemy at a time is not recommended due the light armor and open top exposing the crew.

Penetrating tanks like the T-34s, KV1s, M4s, Matildas is very easy due to the cannon's high penetration power.

Enemies the Sd.Kfz.251/22 should avoid are the vehicles equipped with fast-firing autocannons like SPAAs or light tanks. Due to their high rate of fire, they can knock out your exposed crew very quickly. Avoid tanks that fire high-calibre HE shells, since the Sd.Kfz.251/22 is vulnerable to overpressure.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Effective cannon even from long range
- Can make sharp turns while driving at good speed
- Good forward speed
- Very good at long range engagements

'''Cons:'''

- Open top leaves crew exposed against HE shells, aircraft and artillery strikes
- No machine gun for defense against lightly armoured vehicles and low-flying aircraft
- Armour is too thin to block even 12.7 mm HMG fire
- Shells often over-penetrate, causing no to little damage.
- Sluggish acceleration

== History ==
