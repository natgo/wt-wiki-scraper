== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour protection of the vehicle is thin and ineffective against any tank cannon and even heavy machine guns.

'''Notes:''' <!-- Any additional notes which the user needs to be aware of -->
<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The vehicle's mobility will take you wherever you need to go. Use it to be able to quickly reach and prepare a sniper/ambush position. Be careful when making sharp turns at maximum speed as the vehicle has a chance of tipping over.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|K51 L/24 (75 mm)}}

The main gun of the Sd.Kfz.251/9 is the same howitzer that you will find on all Pz.IVs found before the F2 model. It gets access to the more capable Hl.Gr 38C round, which is very potent at its low BR, and comes in handy against heavily-armoured vehicles (e.g. B1 bis, 2C bis, etc.). The stock APCBC round has a potent explosive filler and a decent penetration for its BR, but do try to have a handful of HEAT rounds ready in case they are needed. One upside of the (relatively) large calibre of this BR is that you have access to a capable HE round, which will overpressurize lightly-armoured and open-topped vehicles, a useful thing in case SPAAGs shows up.

==== Ammunition ====
The available ammunition offers a wide range of shells to engage all types of targets:

* '''K.Gr.rot Pz.''': APCBC; a slow shell with explosive filler mass that will knock out any tank with a single shot but has an average penetration power.
* '''Hl.Gr 38B''': HEAT; a shaped charge with good penetration and without penetration loss over distance. Only penetrates flat vertical surfaces but the post-penetration damage is very effective on open and lightly armoured vehicles.
* '''Hl.Gr 38C''': HEAT; a shaped charge with increased penetration over the previous shell. Very useful against heavily armoured targets.
* '''Sprgr. 34''': HE; useful for destroying open and lightly armoured vehicles.
* '''K.Gr.Rot Nb.''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Sd.Kfz.251/9 is a lightly armoured vehicle that can be penetrated by nearly anything, including heavy machine guns, and destroyed by overpressure. This means you want to avoid rushing points and areas of high traffic, and instead flank the enemy team with your decent mobility. The 75 mm gun on the 251/9 is excellent at its BR, coming with an APCBC shell with moderate penetration and an excellent HEAT shell with good explosive filler and 100 mm of penetration at all angles. However, sniping with this tank is not recommended, as its gun and shells have low muzzle velocity and high drop, making it difficult to hit your targets at range. A better way to use this tank is in an ambush role. If you can find a good spot that protects your sides and flanks from enemy tanks, you can surprise and quickly destroy almost enemy tank that come your way with your excellent reload speed and HEAT shells. It also has excellent depression, allowing you to engage enemy targets over ridges and give you more combat flexibility.

The biggest threats to this tank are aircraft and flankers. It is an open-topped vehicle, leaving it vulnerable to strafing and bombing from enemy aircraft. Because it lacks a turret, the 251/9 also struggles against flanking manoeuvres and is doomed if an enemy tanker flanks and gets a good firing profile on the side of your tank. To counteract this, stick with teammates and/or relocate after a few shots, to prevent players whose tanks you destroyed from coming back and revenge-bombing you. It may also be beneficial to pair with a friendly SPAA, as they can help provide some measure of defence against CAS.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Highly mobile for the BR, will get to one's destination quickly.
* Potent gun with a fast reload that allows for versatile engagement of enemies
* Gun depression makes hull-down positions possible

'''Cons:'''

* Open-topped, vulnerable to HE rounds, artillery strikes and strafing aircraft
* A single shot can knock out the driver, gunner and loader at once, leaving you vulnerable
