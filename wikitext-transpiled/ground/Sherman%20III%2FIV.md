== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was an experimental hybrid between two Sherman vehicles Sweden acquired post-war from the UK, a total of four Shermans were bought in for trial and study purposes on foreign tank designs that could be useful for Sweden's own future tank development and acquisitions. The {{PAGENAME}} was most likely a vehicle testing how different combinations of the Sherman platform performed together and how interchangeable the parts are for repairs. In-game the vehicle is erroneously depicted with a Sherman IV hull while the real vehicle used a Sherman IB hull. When the tests were completed the Sherman IB and III were restored to their original configurations before eventually ending up at Axvall Tank Museum. When Axvall closed they were transferred along with the rest of the collection to Arsenalen where they remain in storage. 

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]] as a Swedish premium vehicle, which gave Sweden a Sherman of its own and would bolster the Swedish lower tier lineup. {{PAGENAME}} is played like most other [[M4 Sherman (Family)|M4 Sherman]] a good overall medium tank with a short stop stabiliser making it good for quick stops and getting the barrel on target. Sherman’s overall mobility is adequate to get around on maps, with angled armour making the vehicle more effective armour and the ability to bounce shells off the armour. But it’s still vulnerable to enemy fire if flanking and certain vehicles have high enough penetration making short work of the Sherman III/IV armour.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Sherman III/IV has a similar armour profile to the M4A2, but without the additional side armour squares, and also due to the lack of a hull machine gun, it loses the MG-port weak spot. It still has the spot of thinner armour on the front of the turret (area ground out to fit the stabilizer) that most of the other 75 Shermans have.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->

<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

* Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick, the bogies are 10 mm, and the tracks are 20 mm thick.
* Upper front plate has consistent thickness due to lack of MG port weak spot
* A small patch on the turret's front right side is thinner (51 mm) than the rest (76 mm).
* Driver and Machine gunner hatches are 25.4 mm thick

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
Even though the Sherman III/IV is slower in terms of Shermans, its mobility is still good, with quick acceleration and a high top speed. Due to a lack of neutral steering, turning in this tank can be slow from stationary.

{{main|M3 (75 mm)}}

75 mm M3 gun is a competent, well-handling gun for a medium tank. Even without any modifications, its ability to fulfil its role, though where it begins to shine is with the M61 shot. Default, M72, suffers from issues typical to US and British solid shots - poor post-penetration effects. This means it's preferable to take down enemy gunner first, usually by hitting the right side of the turret.

{{main|M1919A4 (7.62 mm)}}

The machine gun on this tank is a general-purpose 7.62 mm M1919A4 Browning machine gun mounted in the coaxial position. A typical machine gun not too unlike on many other vehicles, the machine gun is just average. You will not be able to damage much besides sniping crew in open top vehicles.

The Sherman is an effective medium-range combat tank. Equipped with a fast-firing 75 mm gun and with good handling characteristics, this tank can be an extremely useful asset in most battles.

In battle the Sherman performs well as an all-rounder; the thick turret front and 10 degrees of gun depression make the tank ideal for taking hull-down positions which protect the thinner hull armour from being penetrated by enemy fire. The sloped front upper glacis, when angled, also provides good protection against enemy fire. The reasonable mobility of the Sherman makes flanking a viable tactic. The main weakness of the Sherman is the side armour - not only is it vertical and thin, but behind it most of the ammunition is stowed. The tall silhouette of the tank also makes finding suitable covers difficult. Overall, the M4 Sherman can be considered an armoured jack-of-all-trades - it will serve a tanker well, however, it will not excel in any particular role.

In battle, try to use terrain as cover. Hull-down positions are especially strong in the Sherman, as it has a good 10 degrees of gun depression. The gun mantlet and turret are reasonably strong, but avoiding shots is still the best strategy. In this respect, a hull-down position hides the vulnerable hull. If this is not available, then angling the hull armour to present a greater slope is often a good idea, as this can bounce some low-powered cannon at any range and at longer ranges, render the hull impenetrable.

Another way to play the Sherman is to tap into its traditional cavalry role, mobility. The Sherman is a great flanker as it is fast enough to get the jump on the enemy's side. Defeat the enemy at their weak front lines or go around the entire enemy force. Once in position at their sides or rear, ambush them. Ideally, the enemy should be too busy focusing on allies attacking in the front to notice the Sherman immediately. Take out the weaker light or medium tanks, the 75 mm gun is not very ideal against heavy tanks like the [[KV-1 (L-11)|KV-1]] so take out its friends to allow allies more room to outmanoeuvre the KV tank. An organized attack will increase the chances of success on the battlefield.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

M4A2/[[M4A4 (1st PTG)]]: these Sherman tanks are widely used by both the Allied and the Axis side, so no matter which nation you play they can be quite tough to destroy in the hands of a skilled tanker. Given the rather weak penetration of your short 75 mm gun, their hull can be almost impossible to penetrate when angled, hull down or 300 m away. For an M4A4, there are 2 apparent bulges on the upper front plate, a penetration through there can guarantee a knockout most of the time. But in case the opponent covers them up or when it's an M4A2, aim for the middle parts of the gun mantlet or the turret armour unprotected by the mantlet, you can at least make them defenceless. Note that their guns are equally weak against you, so wiggle around to disrupt their aim while you reload, you have a good chance of bouncing some shells.

[[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1 and variants]] - A vehicle that the M4 Sherman will have trouble against is the KV-1. While the [[KV-1 (L-11)|L-11]] is underpowered, the [[KV-1 (ZiS-5)|ZiS-5]] is potent enough to punch through the Sherman's front, and the Sherman is unable to penetrate the KV-1's thick frontal armour. If this heavy tank is encountered, try to shoot it in its sides and rear, where its armour is thinner and unsloped, though it will still have to be at a close range to penetrate the armour. In addition, shots to the sides will most likely hit fuel tanks or ammunition storage, causing a fire or ammunition detonation and at best, time to reassess the situation.

[[Churchill (Family)|Churchill]] heavy tanks - The Churchills, with their complex hulls and sturdy turrets, can be quite hard to penetrate at range. Again, manoeuvre as close to them as possible, the ideal distance being no more than 200 m. If they are angling their hull but facing their turret at you, only go for the turret. For the Mk I Churchills, aim at the near-vertical part of their rounded cheeks to ensure successful penetrations. For the Mk III and the German Churchill, also aim for their flat turret which is at most 89 mm. The shell should go in easily and knock out most, if not all of the crew. Only when you are facing their hull without any angles should you shoot the hull, otherwise shoot the turret only, as their big tracks can easily get in front of the frontal hull. The side hull has multiple layers of armour, some of which are weirdly angled and can absorb plenty of shells.

[[Pz.IV F2]]/[[Pz.IV G|G]]/[[Pz.IV H|H]]/[[Pz.IV J|J]] - The historical nemesis of any Sherman, the Panzer IV is one of the Sherman's biggest threats at this rank. The long barrel 75 mm gun will easily penetrate the Sherman from the front. The F2 variant is admittedly easy to deal with. A single APCBC to its hull or turret should end it pretty quickly, even at long range. The other variants are slightly harder to deal with. They have thicker hull armour, at 80 mm, which will be much harder to penetrate with the APCBC over 500 m. Luckily the turret armour remains the same at 50 mm. Either aim here with APCBC or sacrifice damage potential and use the AP round to penetrate the hull.

[[StuG III F]]/[[StuG III G|G]] - Another historical nemesis of the Sherman, and another big threat. The StuG III packs the same punch as the Panzer IV line with its long barrel 75 mm gun, whilst losing the turret, which turns out to be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Lacking a turret means that it will have to traverse the whole vehicle to target an enemy, but it also means that it has a lower profile. The StuG's armour profile is also more complex than the Panzer IV, with less flat areas. Certain areas are sloped and very bouncy. Luckily, there is a big weak spot. There are two flat plates on the front of the hull. The flat plate on the right is the driver's port. Shoot that and you can incapacitate the driver, gunner and loader in one go. This is a very efficient way to destroy this vehicle. With the F variant, you can use APCBC to instantly knock out this vehicle with a single shot. With the G variant, it is more reliable to use AP at ranges within 500 m to ensure penetration.

[[8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl.]] - This German half-track is armed with a potent 88 mm gun that can easily knock you out in one shot. However, the gun has a long reload and the half-track has no armour to speak of. Also, its crew members are spread out, so you'll need multiple shots to put it down. The shell you should use while dealing with this is of course your HE shell, packed with over 600 g of explosive. First, you take out the gun. The HE shell will also knock out most of the crew members around it too, as a bonus. Then, take out the two crew members in front of the Flak 37. This may require some more careful aiming, but if you manage to get a good shot, it will likely destroy the vehicle immediately.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Excellent gun depression of -10° plus the angled frontal turret allows it to utilise hills very well
* Great firepower: adequate penetration and post-penetration damage when using M61 shells; can frontally penetrate and knock out most opponents
* Great turret traverse speed allows it to deal with multiple threats easily
* Well-angled frontal hull protects small calibre / low-penetration guns (e.g. 75 mm M3, 50 mm KwK39), and even large calibre guns when angled correctly.
* Adequate top speed allows it to get to positions in time, or to do tactical manoeuvres like flanking
* Fitted with a vertical stabilizer, allowing more accurate fire on the move compared to other tanks, as well as better usage of shoot-n-scoot tactics
* Missing the average Sherman MG weak spot

'''Cons:'''

* Large profile and weak side armour; flankers like the Sd.kfz.234/2 can easily see and penetrate it
* Frontal armour is still inadequate and will get penetrated and knocked out by tanks like [[Pz.IV F2]]/G, [[StuG III F]]/G, [[M10 (Family)|M10]] by a single shot
* The M61 shell struggle to penetrate angled targets like [[StuG III G]], Churchill Mk.III or even the T-34 and M10
* Hull traverse is quite slow, making it sluggish in a turn. Also, the narrow tracks offer poor ground flotation, thus poor off-road capabilities. Can only reach its top speed on paved or hard surfaces
* Roof armour of 19.5 mm thick is vulnerable to airstrikes with AP cannons. For example the widely used MG151 15/20 mm
* Lack of M2 Browning machine gun seen on most other Shermans means anti-aircraft defence is weak and removes the extra option for taking out lighter vehicles or shooting off tracks without having to use your main gun.

After World War II, Sweden acquired four surplus Sherman tanks of various types from Britain for evaluation, one Sherman III (M4A2), one Sherman IB (M4(105)) and two Sherman V (M4A4) versions, one Firefly and one unarmed. Between 1946 and 1947 they underwent different evaluations and trials on how they would fare in Swedish terrain and the overall performance in proper field conditions. All of the Shermans did quite well in the tests and were praised for their reliability and ease of use even with inexperienced drivers and not being properly adapted for the winter conditions they were testing in. Even though the tank was viewed favourably, Sweden never fully adopted the Sherman due to difficulties acquiring spare parts and the Sherman not being seen as enough of an upgrade over the Strv m/42 platform which was already deemed obsolete by the standards at the time. This led to the decision to not procure more Sherman tanks. Sweden was looking for new and better vehicles and went to the British and looked into procuring the more advanced [[Centurion (Family)|Centurion]] as well as the French and the [[AMX-13 (Family)|AMX-13]], this would eventually lead to them acquiring [[Strv 81]] that would serve as the backbone of the Swedish army for the entire Cold War. The unarmed Sherman V would be expended as a range target in 1951 and the Firefly would be used in the late 1950s for testing of early-stage systems that would be used in the future on the [[Strv 103 (Family)|Strv 103]] project. Today the three surviving Sherman's are located at the Arsenalen tank museum although the IB and III are in storage and are not on public display.
