== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Starfighters"]]. One of the most famous Sherman modifications in World War II, the Firefly introduces the potent [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder (76 mm)|17-pounder]] anti-tank gun as the main armament of the Sherman platform, presenting a very drastic increase in firepower over the original [[M3 (75 mm)|75 mm gun]]. This variant, the VC, was based off the chassis of an M4A4 Sherman.

The Sherman Firefly is easily distinguishable by its very long gun, even compared to the Shermans with the American 76 mm guns. The muzzle brake on the cannon is also in a spherical shape rather than a horizontal rectangular shape so that is a distinction between the 76 mm cannon and the 17-pounder. The hull is resemblant to that of the [[M4|M4 Sherman]] although lacking the bow machine gun (it's actually based off an M4A4). The turret is also very similar, although the radio sticks out of the back in a bustle.

This tank should be the supporting line in both offensive and defensive actions, providing flanking fire, long-range fire, or fast and accurate fire to the target while the heavy tanks take up the brunt of the defense. The tank is as mobile as the M4 Sherman, so picking up speed to get around the enemy is not hard. Those familiar with a M4 Sherman control will pick up on this tank very easily. While this tank is also capable of being the frontal attack unit for an assault, it is strongly advised to not due to the thin armour of the tank, necessitating the users to always get the first shot off in an encounter, otherwise the enemy will be able to destroy the Firefly easily. For a conservative, almost TD-like role, it can also perform, destroying tanks from afar.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull)
- Cast homogeneous armour (Transmission area, Turret)

{| class="wikitable"

'''Notes:'''

- Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick, bogies are 10 mm thick, and tracks are 20 mm thick.
- Belly armour is 12.7 mm thick.
- The bow machine gun area has been welded shut with armour, but is only 25.4 mm thick so may present a viable weakness to weaker enemies.
- Unlike the armour on the American Rank III Shermans which saw itself upped from 50.8 mm to 63.5 mm, the British Firefly in Rank III retains the old 50.8 mm base armour thickness on the front hull, as well as the protruding driver and co-driver hatches in front. This makes the Firefly a much more vulnerable Sherman tank than even the American versions, a trade-off for its more powerful armament.

==== Ammunition ====

- '''Shot Mk.6:''' {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}} - Standard penetrating round, use until better rounds are unlocked.
- '''Shell Mk.1:''' {{Annotation|HE|High-explosive}} - It is ideal for destroying SPAA and lightly armoured tanks, but useless against anything else.
- '''Shot Mk.4:''' {{Annotation|APC|Armour-piercing capped}} - Cap for better grip against sloped armour.
- '''Shot Mk.8:''' {{Annotation|APCBC|Armour-piercing capped ballistic capped}} - Like Shot Mk.4 but with a ballistic cap for improved flight path, as well as better penetration.
- '''Shot SV Mk.1:''' {{Annotation|APDS|Armour-piercing discarding sabot}} - Highest armour penetration of any shot, but has worse spalling effect.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Shoot and scoot. Unless the enemy's tank gunner has been knocked out (black only), cannon breech has been disabled (red/black), or cannon barrel is disabled (red/black) that inhibits the enemy's ability to fire back, don't expose the tank after firing. Always try to retreat back into cover to reload. Once reloaded, preferably pop out of an area different from the last firing position and take another shot. Make sure to eliminate the enemy's ability to fire back by destroying their cannon breech and traverse gears, or incapacitate their driver and gunner again if they were replaced. During this whole process, watch out for other enemy tanks and avoid being swarmed. With situational awareness combined with the correct usage of the map, the Firefly becomes a decent tank capable of effectively fighting every medium and heavy tank it faces.

The Firefly can excel at vaporizing tanks that have clustered crew, like StuGs, SUs, T-34s, KVs, and even Panzer IIIs and IVs. The post-penetration affect of the Firefly's shells after the AP buffs allow it to decimate those tanks. However, it is recommended to still shoot from afar, as all of these tanks can destroy the Firefly easily.

Definitely do not play too aggressively. The huge weakness of the 3/4 crew in the turret is almost always pointed out immediately, because it's a huge issue. A good hit either means a quick trip back to the hangar, or a lengthy crew replenishment time in AB. But this ignores the fact that the tank is just a huge glass cannon, as any shot anywhere will likely cripple the tank.

The Sherman Firefly can dish out the punishment necessary for heavy tanks, but can't take it. Don't expose the tank towards enemy fire too long due to the thin armour on the Firefly in comparison to other tanks such as the Soviet [[T-34-85]]s and the German [[Panther D|Panthers]]. Take a shot, preferably from a flanking location, then retreat into cover regardless of the shot's effect on target, because if the target could swing its gun towards the Firefly, or have friends that could hit it, consider writing off the Firefly very soon. This varies between different enemies, as going against something like the [[KV-2 (1939)|KV-2]] would be different than going against a [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]].

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Uses the tried and tested Sherman chassis. Experienced players will find this tank easy to use.
- Very fast turret traverse speed.
- The 17-Pounder gun, which can penetrate every single tank it faces, although newer players may struggle against the Panther.
- APDS rounds with excellent penetrating capabilities
- Fast reload even with untrained crew.
- 77 rounds maximum.
- Fast and very mobile.
- Has .50 cal AA machine gun that's unique among other vehicles as it can rotate for 360°.
- Has no side bulges unlike the Premium version.
- Post penetration damage tends to be enough to knock out crews when clustered together, such as on the T-34 series or turrets.

'''Cons:'''

- Armour of a [[M4|M4 Sherman]], very thin for a Rank III vehicle
- Large profile
- 4 crew members, 3 of which are clustered in the turret, making it easier to knock out
- Bad gun depression of only -5 degrees
- Gun post-penetration damage is decent with the AP buffs, but still won't always knock out a tank in one hit
- Short ready rack (5 shells), resulting in a much longer reload time after depleting
- Smart enemies will shoot the spot where the radio operator gunner usually sat, as in the Firefly, that spot is replaced by ammo (unless carrying 54 rounds)
- Lacks [[Add-on Armor|additional armour]], unlike its British counterpart
- Reverse speed is bad
- Like all vehicles armed with early version of the 17-pounder gun, it will struggle before it has the Shot Mk.8
- Stock AP round is painful to use. It fragments poorly, bounces often and does very little damage unless hitting ammo or modules
- Unlike other Shermans, it doesn't have access to a gun stabilizer and thus the gun sight will rock up and down on a sudden stop
- Traverse is mediocre, and bad when its stock
- Insufficient mobility when stock

=== In Italian Service ===
[[File:Sherman Vc (Italy) .png|thumb|Impression of an Italian Sherman VC during  military exercises]]
The Firefly first saw action in Italy in British, American, and Polish hands in the Italian Campaign in 1944, but were ceased since heavy German armour proved to be a challenging opponent for the Firefly. After WW2, Italy was supplied with tanks by the US and UK, such as the [[Sherman Firefly]] (designated as [[M4 Tipo IC]] or M4 Tipo VC depending on the variant) and [[M24 (Italy)|M24 Chaffee]], which were commissioned in 1947. At that time, Italy created the first nucleus for the formation of a tankers school, and on the 1st of October officially formed the Military School Organization.

The M4 Tipo VCs were decommissioned and scrapped in 1952.
