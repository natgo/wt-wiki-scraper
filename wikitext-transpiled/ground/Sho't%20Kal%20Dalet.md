== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

Originally introduced in the [[Sho't Kal Dalet (Great Britain)|British tech tree]], the {{PAGENAME}} was moved into the Israeli tech tree. It closely resembles the standard tech tree variant [[Sho't Kal Gimel]] with differences mostly in cosmetics, with the {{PAGENAME}} appearing in a default desert tan camouflage and a spare road wheel hanging in front.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

As a Centurion-based tank, the {{PAGENAME}} comes under increasingly lethal enemy shells, APFSDS and HEAT-FS, that can easily penetrate the front of the tank. Some attempts can be seen to remedy this issue, with an extra 51 mm plate welded on top of the base 76.2 mm hull front armour, and ERA platings to help protect against HEAT-FS. Both of these can help resist against the glancing kinetic or chemical shells and hopefully provide extra breathing room for the {{PAGENAME}} to continue manoeuvring on the battlefield.

Side armour, without any up-armouring effort, proves to be vulnerable against autocannon rounds from IFVs or SPAAs, so it is best to keep the tank's frontal array pointed towards the main threat. Any penetration on the tank, whether from the front or the sides, have a very high chance of hitting one of the crew, the ammunition, or the fuel. Combined with the relatively dubious reliability of the front armour, a {{PAGENAME}} would benefit from a very safe playstyle reducing the number of chances the {{PAGENAME}} can be hit in.

Front-launching smoke grenades are also available with the tank, allowing the players the option to quickly bring up concealment in order to withdraw the {{PAGENAME}} to a safe place if under threat of enemy fire.

'''Armour type:'''

*Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Roof, Turret roof, Cupola roof, Side skirts, Smoke launchers)
*Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Gun mantlet, Cupola sides)

'''Notes:'''

*Tracks and suspension wheels are both 20 mm thick.
*The steel boxes around the turret and the hull give a 4 mm additional protection, though this seems to be a negligible addition.
*Skirting are placed on the sides of the Centurion, giving an additional 6 mm of side protection and can act as spaced armour.
*An internal structural plate of 17 mm thickness separates the forward ammo rack from the driver as seen in X-ray mode.
*Another internal 17 mm structural plate with large openings separates the driving compartment from the fighting compartment.
*Each block Blazer ERA provides 260 mm worth of Chemical Energy protection

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

Compared to the tech tree [[Sho't Kal Alef]] and [[Sho't Kal Gimel]], the {{PAGENAME}} has very similar mobility due to sharing the same engine upgrade into a 750 hp Continental diesel engine with 2,400 RPM. Forward speeds can reach up to 48 km/h (5 gears) in RB. Reverse speed, great already in the basic Centurion, is enhanced by this engine upgrade to reach up to -12 km/h (2 gears) to aid in the tank's withdrawal efforts.

{{main|Sharir (105 mm)}}

The Sharir main gun is based on the [[L7A3 (105 mm)|Royal Ordnance L7 gun]] and so it can fire an assortment of APFSDS, HEAT-FS, HESH, and smoke rounds for a relatively versatile options of attacking. With a fast reload speed of down to 6.7 seconds, a {{PAGENAME}} in a decent ambush site can make quick work of several enemies downrange.

{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|FN MAG 60-40 (7.62 mm)}}

Like its tech tree counterparts, the Sho't Kal Dalet comes with multiple machine guns. In total, there are 2 coaxial machine guns ([[FN MAG 60-40 (7.62 mm)]] & [[M2HB (12.7 mm)]]) and 2 roof-mounted machine guns ([[FN MAG 60-40 (7.62 mm)]]). Though there is only one 12.7 mm machine gun, the four machine guns firing in unison can prove dangerous to any low-flying aircraft to cripple certain components or discourage the aircraft from staying low near a {{PAGENAME}}.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

As mentioned in previous sections, the {{PAGENAME}} is rather poorly protected against straight-on kinetic hits, but its cannon is quite lethal with the available ammunition and rate of fire. As such, the {{PAGENAME}} should be used moreso as a "sniper", staying farther range and using the Sharir cannon and the M111 APFSDS round to engage enemies from afar.

This playstyle is benefited from the laser rangefinder available to the {{PAGENAME}}, which can provide accurate, and compensated, ranges for the cannon to fire at the enemy quickly. When firing from so far, the only enemy threats would be tanks with similar fire control systems for long-range fighting or missile launchers. In the latter case, the presence of ERA plates on the {{PAGENAME}} may prove key to its survival by protecting the tank against a single hit, which then allows {{PAGENAME}} players to assess where the missile came from and either withdraw into cover or engage the missile launcher if it has been spotted.

Fighting in a hull-down position would also benefit the {{PAGENAME}} to reduce its profile to the turret, which has a more complex armour design as well as more ERA coverage from the front.

While close-range fighting is not impossible with the {{PAGENAME}} with its stabilized gun and mobility, the weak side armour and relatively slow turret and hull traverse makes the vehicle not ideal to that playstyle.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- 105 mm Sharir cannon has impressive ammunition options
- Cannon is fully stabilized for fighting on-the-move
- Laser range finder allows for easier range acquisition to engage in long-range combat
- ERA can prove sufficient against incoming chemical warheads or ATGM
- Vehicle front profile is relatively small and has good ERA coverage

'''Cons:'''

- Vehicle is still slower than other contemporary medium tanks of the rank
- Armour against kinetic energy threats is rather weak
- Internals are full of vital components, a single penetration can easily cripple the tank's combat ability, if not outright destroy it

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

===[[wt:en/news/5912-development-sho-t-kal-dalet-conquering-the-desert-en|Devblog]]===
In the late 1950s, Israel struck a deal with Great Britain to purchase a number of Centurion Mk.5 tanks as a response to Egypt's own rearmament efforts at the time. Deliveries continued well into the 1960s, with Israel fielding more than 300 Centurion tanks prior to the Six-Day War in 1967.

Although the Centurion, or Sho't as it was called by the Israelis, was the most modern tank in service with the IDF at the time, it wasn't very liked among Israeli tank crews due to its low reliability in desert conditions. Therefore, the decision was made to modernize the vehicles in May 1967 by replacing the petrol engine with a more powerful and reliable Continental diesel engine. Further upgrades included the fitting of a new transmission, larger fuel tanks and other minor improvements.

In the following Middle Eastern conflicts of the late '60s and early '70s, the Sho't had proven its effectiveness in combat. However, after the devastating tank losses of the Yom Kippur War, Israeli engineers realized the importance of crew protection and work on an indigenous tank design, that would become the Merkava, began.

In the meantime, the vehicles that were already in service had to be modernized in order to prevent a repeat of the high losses of the Yom Kippur War in potential future conflicts. This modernization effort primarily focused on the addition of the Blazer ERA package to the Sho't Kal and Magach tanks, which would reduce the effectiveness of chemical munitions fired at the vehicles.

The upgraded Sho't Kal Dalet, as it was known, proved the effectiveness of the upgrade during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, where it fared well against ATGMs and RPGs.

The Sho't Kal Dalet was the last mass-produced modification of the Israeli Centurion, before it was replaced by the more modern Merkava tank models. In total, Israel had purchased and used over 1,100 Centurion tanks, with some still being in limited service today as APCs, ARVs or CEVs.
