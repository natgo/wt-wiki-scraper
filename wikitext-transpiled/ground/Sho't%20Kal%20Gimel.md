== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Sho't Kal Gimel''' was the third serial modification of the [[Sho't Kal Alef|Sho't Kal]] series developed based on the British Centurion. The Sho't Kal Gimel modification took place from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The tank received additional machine guns, new 10-round smoke grenade launchers on the turret sides, and "Blazer" ERA on the hull and turret. This variant was withdrawn from service along with other Sho't Kal variants in 2007.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Sho't Kal Gimel shares similar capabilities to previous Sho't Kal series tanks, but with better chemical protection and small improvements to firepower. Unlike its [[Sho't Kal Alef|predecessor]], it receives a laser rangefinder, smoke grenade launchers, the powerful M111 "Hetz" HEAT round, and "Blazer" ERA, allowing the tank to withstand hits from high-explosive rounds and ATGMs. While the firepower is good, it lacks the thermal imaging system of the [[Sho't Kal Dalet]]. It is still a relatively competitive tank that has very capable gun depression, and the ERA blocks improve tank survivability against shaped-charge warheads like HEAT and ATGMs, which become increasingly common at this rank. In addition, the tank retains good mobility.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The overall appearance of the Sho't Kal Gimel is very similar to its predecessor, the Alef; but in view of the intensity of the Middle Eastern Wars, the Gimel installed the Blazer ERA covering its front and some parts of its sides, as well as an extra layer of armour plate welded on the UFP, increasing its odds to survive a hit. The IDF also installed additional machine guns, so players can tell it's a Sho't Kal Gimel right away. Although the installation of ERA helped improved its odds against HEAT shells, but later missiles or kinetic shells will easily penetrate the obsolete base armour all-around.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, turret roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, gun mantlet)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,162|rbMinHp=663}}

The overall mobility, thanks to the new Continental AVDS-1790-2A diesel engine and Allison CD-850-6A transmission, has vastly improved from original Centurions (48 km/h vs 35 km/h forward) and oddly enough, Gimel is lighter than Alef, meaning the overall mobility is better. While it is nowhere close to Soviet or later NATO tanks in terms of power-weight ratio, it is still sufficient to keep up with the rest of the team.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|Sharir (105 mm)}}

The main gun "Sharir" (lit. "Strong") is identical to NATO's L7 105 mm guns in many aspects. In particular, the Gimel has access to APFSDS round that further enhance its odds to penetrate enemies.

==== Ammunition ====
The Sho't Kal Gimel shares most of the shells from the previous Alef while also having access to APFSDS rounds.

The stock M152 HEATFS, while mostly sufficient to penetrate tanks of the era with ease, will have a hard time penetrating tanks with composite armour like [[T-55AMD-1]] or ERA like [[T-69 II G]]. It is still sufficient to knock out lighter vehicles with overpressure damage.

M156 shell, aka L35, is identical to other 105 mm HESH rounds, having high explosive content to knock out vehicles right away with overpressure while the overall performance of the shell is mixed, not to mention its slow and high-arcing ballistics; so either take this shell for detonating lighter vehicles or sniping stationary targets that expose their vulnerable spots. A solid hit is very likely to send enemies straight back to the hanger.

M111 APFSDS, aka DM23, is found on some other NATO vehicles and they perform identically. Being a long-rod dart, this shell can safely penetrate most tanks it might face at the rank. This will be the go-to round for the tank.

Since the Sho't Kal can carry more shells than the original [[Sho't]], this will further increase the risk of ammunition cook-off; so it is advised to only bring at most 25 shells to clear out most of the ammo racks.

=== Machine guns ===

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|L3A1 (7.62 mm)}}

Although a M2HB is mounted onto the tank, it was mounted on the mantlet and only serves as one of the coaxial machine guns, this hinders its capabilities to fight back against oncoming aircraft or helicopters; but in case players do need a way to fight back, there are still 2 L3A1 (M1919A3) onboard as a last-ditch option.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Players of the previous Sho't Kal Alef will quickly find themselves at home since the overall handling of Gimel is very similar, if not identical to the aforementioned. Gimel has an extra layer of armour on its UFP as well as Blazer ERA on some areas of the tank; while this can help it survive full-calibre and HEAT shells, it will not survive any late Cold War-era missiles or most APFSDS. The cramped interior also means any penetrating shots will cause extensive damage to the crew and compartment. Thus, it is best to stay away from heated battlefields and never rush in Sho't Kal Gimel (its inferior speed also helps to limit this).

However, this tank does still have some advantages: it has access to APFSDS, although not having the highest penetration at its rank, it is sufficient to tear through enemy armour from a distance. It might not have the best gun optics or handling due to the obsolete nature of Centurion chassis, but it can still serve its purpose if used with caution.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extra protection on its UFP and access to ERA, enhancing some of its survivability
* Access to APFSDS
* Smoke shells to block enemies' sight and high smoke grenade counts
* Sufficient rate of fire

'''Cons:'''

* Relatively slow compared to its competitors
* Slow gun traverse speed
* Cramped crew and compartment
* low glacis is a huge weakspot that cant protect it against even a decent amount of spaa

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
<!-- {{main|Sho't Kal Alef#History|l1=History of the Sho't Kal Alef}} -->
After the earlier modification of Sho't (Centurion in Israel service) with NATO equipment by 1974, the Gimel (C) modification of Sho't Kal installed additional machine guns, new 10-shot smoke grenade launcher on its turret sides, as well as enhanced protection with a new welded armour plate on its UFP and new Blazer ERA packs on some areas of the tank.

This variant was decommissioned alongside with its fellow Sho't Kal variants in 2007.
