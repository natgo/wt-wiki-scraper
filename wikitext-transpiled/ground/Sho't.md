== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Sho't was the Hebrew name given by the Israeli Armed Forces to the Centurion tanks and their different versions. The first Sho't was a [[Centurion Mk.5/1]] without any relevant modification. The Sho't was introduced to Israel during the 1960s in an effort by the IAF to modernize their tank force. At that time, the IAF only operated modernized Shermans and several WW2-era modified vehicles that were no match for the M48s and T-54s in service with the Arab nations.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Sho't behaves equally to the [[Centurion Mk.5/1]]. It is a very powerful tank that relies heavily on its gun handling. Centurions are not characterized by their mobility, firepower or armour. Instead, they rely on their gun handling, thanks to their two-axis stabilizer and a relatively powerful APDS shell. The 84mm gun will not win in terms of penetration power, however; other rounds like that of the [[T-54 (1949)|T-54]]'s 100m D-10T or the [[Leopard I]]'s L7A3. Despite this, combined with the two-axis stabilizer, it can be used effectively to push corners and shoot while moving to avoid enemy fire. This also gives the Sho't a much quicker reaction time since it doesn't have to stop to get a precise shot if it encounters an enemy while changing positions or flanking.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Players can tell the Sho't in-game as a Centurion Mk.5 right away as the bore evacuator is unique to later variants of Centurion (QF 20 pdr Model B), as well as the additional pintle-mounted M2HB machine gun, though it lacks the headlights found on the Australian variant. The overall protection is totally identical to pre-Mk 10 Centurion variants, which also means that it has the same cramped interior and any penetrating shots can knock out the Sho't right away.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

'''Notes:''' <!-- Any additional notes which the user needs to be aware of -->
<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

* Tracks and suspension wheels are both 20 mm thick.
* The steel boxes around the turret and hull give a 4 mm additional protection, though this seems to be a negligible addition.
* Spaced armour plates are placed on the side of the Centurion, giving an additional 6 mm of side armour.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,007|rbMinHp=575}}

Since the Sho't was directly imported from various sources, it shares identical mobility and its Rolls-Royce Meteor engine; players of British or Sweden Centurions will find themselves at home right away. This also means that the overall mobility is inferior just like most unmodified Centurions.

{{main|20pdr OQF Mk.I (84 mm)}}

The QF 20 pounder Model B cannon on Sho't is identical to other 20 pounder guns in various services; with gun stabilizer and APDS at its disposal, the gun can be used to great effect against late war and early Cold War vehicles where a stabilizer wasn't commonplace.

==== Ammunition ====
The stock round, Shot Mk.1, is an APCBC shell; while its penetration is sufficient to penetrate tanks like Tiger II; it will not penetrate early Cold War tanks like M48A1 or T-54s. Additionally, it doesn't have any explosive filler, so players will need to aim for weakspots or ammo racks to achieve the most devastating damage.

The second stock shell, Shell Mk.1 HE, is practically useless against any armoured targets and not even enough to trigger overpressure damage. While it is still enough to blast exposed crews, it is suggested to ignore this shell.

Shot Mk.3 APDS is another story: its flat trajectory and high velocity helps it in hitting long-distance targets or fast movers. However, the overall post-effect is still quite disappointing, so players have to remember the weakspots or ammo racks just like with the Shot Mk.1.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 8 and 9 are first stage ammo racks. They total 8 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
** These racks are also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is 8 - 9 - 1 - 2 - etc. until 7.
** Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready racks 8 and 9.  If the ready racks are empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-7 into racks 9 then 8. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

Unlike other Centurions, the Sho't has a pintle-mounted M2HB, giving it some capabilities to fight back against aircraft or lightly-protected vehicles; while the coaxial machine gun has changed from [[BESA (7.92 mm)|BESA]] to [[L3A1 (7.62 mm)|L3A1]] (M1919A4) for logistical reasons.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Like other Centurions, thanks to the underpowered engine, Sho't is not a fast tank by any means and its 35 km/h top speed makes it lag behind some tanks at its rank, not to mention fast movers like Leopard 1. However, this also means that the Sho't can stay close with friendly heavy tanks (which are still common at the battle rating) and provide reliable fire support for them even on the move thanks to its gun stabilizer. Although the overall protection is not sufficient to withstand shots from enemies, the gun depression angle certainly helps to find hull-down positions and use the gun mantlet to absorb or bounce incoming shells. While some players prefer the high penetration of APDS, some might opt to use the stock APCBC for better spalling; but in most cases where the enemy has thick armour, APDS will be the go-to shell for Sho't.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has a two-plane gun stabilizer, making it able to shoot on the move
* Cannon with good penetration power
* Has a roof-mounted .50 cal MG

'''Cons:'''

* The ammo stowage in the front of the tank is a huge weak spot easy to target
* Slow for a medium tank being slower than some heavy tanks of the same BR
* 3 out of 4 crew members are on the same side of the tank and can be knocked out at once with a well-placed shot

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Sho't participated in different wars in IAF service, of course, not without being upgraded during it's whole life service. The first Sho't fitted by the IAF was acquired in 1958. In this time the IAF was due to receive the Chieftain and was negotiating with Britain to acquire this new heavy tank.

The IAF acquired several Mk.3 and Mk.5 Centurions from different sources while the Chieftain tanks were negotiated, since many arab nations were upgrading their tank fleets with American made M48 tanks and Soviet T-54s that were far superior to the modified Sherman and other WW2 vehicles fitted by the IAF.

The Sho't was modernized in several moments and served with the IAF up until this day. Variants of the Sho't like the Alef/Bet/Gimel/Dalet have appeared and modernize both the armour, mobility and firepower of the vehicle. The Sho't received 105mm guns with modern APFSDS projectiles, it also received first generation ERA made by Israel and several upgrades to the power plant since the Centurion tanks were many times considered underpowered for modern tank doctrine.

The Sho't participated during the Six Days War of 1967 and the Yom Kippur War. The Sho't proved very vulnerable to man portable anti tank weapons like the RPG-2 and RPG-7, as well as AT-3 Sagger missiles, this were weapons fitted in large number by Egyptian and Syrian forces and thus resulted in many Sho't tanks being lost in combat. The Sho't also participated in the Invasions of the Lebanon in 1978 and 1982, were it's vulnerabilities were also demonstrated.

The Sho't has also been converted into other vehicles, specially IFVs and APCs, like the Nagma, Nagmachon, Nakpadon and Puma armored Combat Engineering Vehicle.
