== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The survivability of the 10M2 is lacking, which is to be expected of a small SPAA vehicle. However, it is not without some quirks that can sometimes keep a player alive.

The thickest armour on the vehicle is only 14 mm, the rest is 7 mm. This is barely enough to protect the crew from stray low-calibre MG fire and more distant shrapnel, and will not provide any protection against higher-calibre MGs, rocket and bomb explosions, or even the odd HE shell.

The interesting part of the 10M2 is its relatively uncluttered interior that can make hasty enemy shots ineffective. Two of the three crew members sit in the very front of the hull (commander and driver), with the third (gunner) towards the rear underneath the launcher assembly. The engine sits in the middle of the vehicle, with the rear section holding a few spare missiles. Therefore, when enemy fire strikes the middle of the vehicle (which many players instinctively aim for), it will often knock out the gunner and/or the turret assembly but leave the front two crew members, and sometimes even the engine, unscathed, allowing the 10M2 to get away.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The 10M2's mobility is solidly average. The engine can propel the little vehicle at a decent speed but takes a while to do so, and is not happy when climbing hills. A not often used but still valuable feature is the 10M2's amphibious capability, allowing it to reach a few places and take some shorter routes that other vehicles cannot. In all, while the 10M2 will not win many races against other vehicles, it is still fast enough to do its job well.

{{main|9M37M}}

The 9M37M missile is a worthy analogue to the Stinger-type missiles found on Western IR SAM vehicles such as the [[Ozelot]], [[Type 93]], and [[LAV-AD]]. It doesn't have as good lock characteristics, notably in frontal aspect engagements, but makes up for it with an overload of 20G, double any contemporary ground-based IR SAM system except for the [[SIDAM 25 (Mistral)]] and the [[SANTAL]], both of which still only have 12G missiles. Against highly manoeuvrable targets, these missiles are far easier to score hits with.

There are no missile upgrades available, the stock missile is the top missile. The proximity fuse and warhead weight are both sufficient for destroying or crippling any aerial target it connects with, with the only drawback being the seeker head - it is easily decoyed by flares, a feature familiar to users of Russian aerial infrared missiles.

{{main|PKMB (7.62 mm)}}

The 7.62 mm MG on the 10M2 is pretty much an afterthought, given that open-top vehicles are exceedingly rare at this BR. However, it is very handy to have around for clearing small fences or obstacles in front of the vehicle, something other IR SAM vehicles like the [[Type 93]] and [[Ozelot]] cannot do. It is not recommended to use this as an offensive weapon against air targets given its limited firing arcs and the fact that the 10M2 already has very nice missiles for that exact purpose.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The best way to use the 10M2 is as a short-range surprise weapon against enemy aircraft and sometimes helicopters. The missiles cannot reach as far as many of the radar missile-equipped SPAA vehicles you will often be playing alongside, but they have very good overload and do not give the enemy a radar warning. Engaging aircraft that are busy with other targets or just starting to exit the battlefield is the best way to engage, as distracted enemies are less likely to see the missile and dump flares.

The worst enemy of this vehicle is helicopters, at any range. At long range, they are outside the lock range of the 10M2's missile while being well within the range of their own ATGMs. At closer range (below about 1 mile), the missile is often unable to track enemy helicopters due to its launch characteristics. Helicopters around the 10M2's BR also start to get IRCM equipment, making IR lock even more difficult. High-altitude aircraft are more of the same thing, being able to loft missiles and bombs at ground targets from outside the missile's lock-on distance.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros'''

* The missiles have a high overload factor, more than any other ground-launched IR missile
* Small size, it can easily hide behind rocks, bushes, or buildings
* Except for the launcher assembly, the rest of the vehicle is very low to the ground
* Amphibious, can reach a few places other vehicles cannot
* More survivable than it seems due to crew placement and empty space in the rear of the vehicle

'''Cons:'''

* Can't engage helicopters equipped with ATGMs because of the [[9M37M|9M37]]'s short range
* No search radar. A 3-mile range tracking radar is all you get
* Engine suffers on inclines, hills are not your friend

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The ZRK 9A35M2 'Strela-10M2' was built to be the successor of the 9K31 'Strela-1' built on the BRDM-2 wheeled chassis, and is able to use the older missile from that platform if needed. Development of the new vehicle began on July 24th, 1969, with the decision being made to continue developing a new IR SAM system in spite of the [[2S6|9K22 'Tunguska']] also being developed at the same time, economical reasons often being cited as the main deciding factor to continue with both. The faster reaction time of the Strela missile system, as well as its immunity to radar jamming, were also highly desired by the Soviet Army's anti-aircraft forces.

Unlike the previous Strela system, being mounted on a lightly-armoured amphibious car, the new vehicle would be mounted on the newer and more mobile MT-LB, an infantry transport vehicle from the late 1950s. This would provide far more room for equipment and extra ammunition, among other things.

The [[9M37M|9M37]] missile went through testing from 1973 to 1974, but disappointing results forced a delay while the kinks were ironed out. Designers of the Strela system used this time to introduce improved equipment onto the MT-LB base vehicle, such as more modern radios and provisioning for easier connection to the Soviet integrated air defense system in use at the time.

The vehicle was first introduced in 1976 and has been in service ever since. Combat usage first occurred in 1988 during the Angolan Civil War, with the first large-scale use of the system being Operation Desert Storm, during which it is believed 27 coalition aircraft were hit by Iraqi missiles, with 14 of those being lost.
