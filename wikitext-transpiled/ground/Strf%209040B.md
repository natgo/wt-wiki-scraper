== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]]. It is one of the first Strf-9040 versions and is in a folder with the CV9030FIN. This model has a Bofors 40mm canon and compared to the Bushmasters it is much better, only issue is the 24-round reload magazine that limits its firing power, with that comes trigger-control. It has good amount of penetration, and a decent turret rotation speed. Although sluggish when stock, it can become something greater when spaded.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
It has great speed combined with a very good and underrated 40mm gun that can shred its enemies to pieces. The good manoeuvrability is great and it has a decent engine even when stock, but it gets even better when spaded. It has a great gun with good penetration values and an awesome rate of fire. It can also unlock fuse shells that let it fight aircraft as good as any anti-air and it has access to 6 smoke-shells. it has access to Generation 2 thermals and It also has access to a scout-drone.<!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Strf 9040B excels in ambush and support roles due to its fast-firing autocannon that can severely damage an MBT frontally or destroy it from the sides and rear. However, the Strf 9040B lacks the armour and penetration to effectively spearhead a frontal assault against MBTs and lacks the mobility to quickly reach advantageous spots to ambush approaching MBTs.

When using the Strf 9040B, it is extremely important to manage your ammunition as it only takes 4.8 seconds to completely empty the autoloader, leaving you defenceless. To avoid this, it's recommended to fire in short bursts targeting critical systems and crew. Additionally, it is important to know the crew positions of commonly faced vehicles such as the M1 Abrams, Leopard 2, and Russian T series tanks as they can vary, and the low spall of the Slpprj m/90 APFSDS requires precise aim to be effective.

The Strf 9040B can also carry the Kulsgr m/90 HE-VT round, allowing for the effective removal of low-flying aircraft and thinly armoured vehicles such as most SPAA.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Decent manoeuvrability
* High fire rate 40 mm autocannon
* Low profile
* HE-VT allowing both ground and air engagements

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks ability to effectively brawl MBTs without team support
* Thinly armoured
* 24-round magazine with slow replenishment time
* APFSDS has Low spalling after penetration

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Strf 9040B was an updated version of the 9040A, it was updated to meet modern standards at the time installing such things as a fully stabilized gun as well as incorporating new electronic systems. They also made the suspension better as to improve accuracy on the move as well as crew confort. The gun was also upgraded going from the Bofors automatkanon m/70Bb to the Bofors automatkanon m/70Bc that added an electronic firing pin to improve the accuracy of shots. The model was introduced October 1999 and the Swedish armed forces bought about 44 of the 9040B model.
