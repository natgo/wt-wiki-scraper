== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a modernized version of the Strf 9040, developed by BAE Systems Hägglunds in Sweden. Compared to the A and B versions, the {{PAGENAME}} comes with a new turret with improved protection, enhancing the survivability and situational awareness of the crew. It was also equipped with air conditioning that made it more comfortable for the crew to be deployed in warmer climates and for more international usage.

The {{PAGENAME}} was introduced along with the initial Swedish ground tree in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]]. Having high mobility in all terrains and a fast-firing autocannon, it is an excellent nimble and hard-hitting light tank for the Swedish line-up. Compared to most IFVs found in the game, the {{PAGENAME}} is quite different to its peers. The tank has no anti-tank missiles, and sits at the highest ranks, facing vehicles other IFVs never get to experience. This is due to the design of the vehicle, as the {{PAGENAME}} features a reliable 40 mm Bofors cannon which should be familiar to most players. However, this cannon fires APFSDS, capable of shredding any opponent from the side, even frontally in some cases. This compensates for the lack of missiles, and results in a highly versatile vehicle capable of disposing of several opponents at once, as it can fire up to 24 shells in the span of 12 seconds.

If the anti-tank capabilities weren't enough, the cannon features proximity-fused HE shells, capable of tearing apart any unsuspecting aerial opponent. This feature is incredibly useful in higher tiers, as close-range helicopters and attacking planes are incredibly common. Despite the {{PAGENAME}} lacking any form of radar equipment compared to its SPAA counterpart, the [[Lvkv 9040C]], the tank can still effectively deal with aerial targets, especially at closer ranges.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The tank has a decent amount of armour for a light Tank. The tank is nearly completely covered with composite screens effective against chemical rounds.

The upper front hull is a heavily sloped 20 mm thick plate covered with composite screens. The lower plate is 20 mm thick and only covered on the upper half with a composite screen. In the front of the vehicle is located the engine and transmission that can absorb any round that may go through the composite screen. Between the engine and the crew compartment stands a 10 mm thick inner plate that stops most shrapnel that could come from a penetrating shell. The upper side has an outer 6 mm plate and an inner 10 mm plate, both behind a 160 mm composite screen. The lower side has only a 10 mm thick plate that is partly behind the sprocket system that adds another 30 mm and also behind an 80 mm thick composite screen. The rear of the hull is only a 20 mm thick plate.

The turret is completely covered in 20 mm RHA plates except for the gun mantlet which is 35 mm thick. The Turret is covered from the front to 2/3 of the sides with composite screens. The turret roof is only 20 mm thick.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 6* (autoloader magazine) is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 24 shells.
** This racks get filled first when loading up the tank and is also emptied first.
** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
** Once the autoloader magazine has been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader with at least 1 shell.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 5 into rack 6*. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.
** The first-stage ammo stowage needs 3 second to start reloading, then 3 seconds to reload one bullet, then more 3 seconds to start reloading the first-stage again, taking more than 1 minute between the last shot and being full again so trigger discipline is a must.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Flanking or very carefully aimed shots are key as none of the 9040C's ammo types can penetrate the frontal armour of most MBTs found at the BR, but its high rate of fire means that penetrations are quickly lethal. Since the magazine carries 24 rounds, it is advisable to fire the weapon in burst of either four or eight rounds with an interval of 2 - 4 seconds in between, especially at range.

However, the vehicle's low armour and relatively average speed mean that patience and caution will be what keep you alive long enough to actually ''get'' those kills.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Rapid-fire 40 mm gun with APFSDS
* Shreds enemy tanks from the sides
* HE-VT useful against helicopters
* Very mobile
* Low profile
* Deadly in flanking manoeuvres

'''Cons:'''

* Susceptible to overpressure
* Speed is not too impressive when compared to other top-tier tanks
* Slpprj m/01 modification with a rather expensive ammo cost per round that will add up
* The restocking time of the autoloader magazine is very slow, taking about a minute to be at full capacity again
* Most MBTs' barrels still take 3-5 shots to break completely, leaving more than enough time for the enemy to react, so you need to plan your shoots carefully

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In 1983, the Combat Vehicle 90 group was created by representatives from many Swedish producers for high mobility vehicles with air defence and anti-tank capabilities in mind. In 1985, the chassis saw development and the first orders for the 40 mm Bofors cannons were done. A year later, in 1986 the prototypes for the Strf 9040 and Strf 9025 were ordered. The prototypes arrived in 1988. The vehicle entered full production in 1993 and is still produced to the present day.<ref name="fmv" />

In 2002 Stridsfordon 9040 "Ceasar" were deployed to the army, "Ceasar" version came with improvements by adding a new machinegun the [[Ksp 58 (7.62 mm)|Ksp 58]] compared to the previous versions that used the [[Ksp 39 C (7.62 mm)|Ksp 39]] over the machine gun the Strf 9040C also got an air conditioner built in for more international use where it could be deployed to warmer climates than used to in Sweden.

One of the Major differences between the "Bertil" version and the "Ceasar" version is the difference in overall protection for the vehicle, "Bertil" version on its 23,1 tonnage compared to the "Ceasar" version landed on 28 tonnage, this is due to the improvements of survivability by adding mine protection under the hull, splinter protection for the crew inside, Add-on armour on the outside with modules that heightens the protection of the chassis itself. all the periscopes also got upgraded with laser filtering. Due to the additional weight of the modifications of Strf 9040C, it decreased the troop carrying capabilities limiting it from 8 to 6 soldiers only.
