== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the Swedish designation for the [[Centurion Mk 10]]. In 1959-1960, Sweden acquired another 110 of [[Centurion (Family)|Centurion]] tanks from the United Kingdom, this time the improved Mk 10 to reinforce the existing fleet of [[Strv 81]]s. The {{PAGENAME}} were a fitting choice since the older 84 mm cannon were getting obsolete in usage and the older version [[Strv 81]] would be getting upgrades to meet the standards of the new {{PAGENAME}} which meant they would get a [[L7 (105 mm) (Family)|105 mm L7]] among other things, but these wouldn't happen till 1964-1966. The {{PAGENAME}} would only get a upgrade once and would serve in the Swedish army until 1995 when they were phased out for the [[Strv 121]]. It had a long service alongside the [[Strv 103 (Family)|Strv 103]] as the backbone for the armoured forces of Sweden, playing a vital role in Swedish defence. Their fate is either dismantled or ended up in museum at the end of their almost 50 year service.

Introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]], the Strv 101 has increased firepower over earlier Strv 81. As one of the first tanks to be equipped with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7A1 tank gun, it equips players with devastating firepower that will undoubtedly destroy any opponent's tanks. Ammunition options are limited to armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) or high explosive squash head (HESH) rounds. Nonetheless, with a staggering 350 mm of armour penetration for the primary anti-tank ammunition, the Centurion Mk 10 is capable of dealing with any foe on the battlefield. However, the mobility of all Centurions is below average, owing to the tank's enormous weight combined with a low horsepower engine. The playstyles are quite similar to the Strv 81, with nearly identical armour arrangement.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Strv 101 has the same armour layout as the [[Centurion Mk 10]]. Weakpoints are the same, that includes the lower frontal plate and some areas on the turret. The armour can bounce and stop some shells, but shouldn't be relied upon, particularly against HEATFS and APDS shells. The tank also comes with 6 mm thick sideskirts which can occasionally prematurely detonate incoming HEAT shells. The armour plate above the engine is very thin, and can be penetrated by most aircraft cannons and some machine guns.

'''Armour type:'''

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High-penetrating gun with access to APDS and HESH shots
* Good gun depression and elevation angles (-10/+20), giving it great terrain adaptation
* Upper glacis and gun mantlet can resist most full-calibre AP shells (e.g. [[T-44-100]])
* Good mobility options with neutral steering and sufficient reverse speed
* Reasonably fast reload speed
* Smoke grenades can cover up the player when there is danger

'''Cons:'''

* Lower glacis is still a prominent weak spot
* Mediocre top speed and acceleration
* No access to HEATFS, unlike other nations' L7 guns
* Engine armour is weak from the top, can be damaged aircraft guns
* Small internal compartment (only 4 crew members) with ammunition scattered all over
* Very slow vertical targeting speed
* Armour becomes weak in an uptier against early APFSDS and HEATFS (e.g. [[T-69 II G|T-69 IIG]], [[T-55AM-1|T-55AM]])

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Strv 101 was the designation given to the 110 British Centurion Mk 10s (105 mm gun) equipped with Swedish communication equipment that were bought in 1958. They were bought after the order for the 240 Centurion Mk 3s that were designated Strv 81. The Swedish Army would then upgrade them to the Strv 101R specification in the 1980s which included Renovation and Modifications. The Strv 106 designation, Strv 101Rs upgraded with new suspensions and fire control system, was proposed but never built.
