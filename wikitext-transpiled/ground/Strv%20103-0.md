== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/6505-development-strv-103-0-last-man-standing-en|pack vehicle]] in [[Update 1.95 "Northern Wind"]]. It was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/7154-shop-may-sale-in-the-gaijin-store-en|May 2021 sale]] but was reintroduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]] as a premium vehicle [[wt:en/news/7332-video-wiki-wiki-review-strv-103-0-now-for-golden-eagles-en|purchasable in-game for Golden Eagles]] {{ge}}.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

{{Notice|With a superbly sloped front hull armour, incoming kinetic rounds are prone to harmlessly bounce off, though chemical rounds will typically do some damage. Side, rear and top armour of the vehicle are weak, most aircraft can penetrate the roof, especially if they have 20 mm rounds or larger. With a total of three crew members, survivability after taking hits tend to be slim. However, the Strv 103 series are the only tanks that can operate with only one crew member! A major drawback is without transmission/engine you can no longer manoeuvre the hull to aim left or right. '''[[Strv_103_(Family)|Check out the Strv 103 Family here!]]'''}}

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The Strv 103-0 is a heavily angled tank offering 40 mm armour sloped at 77 degrees able to bounce almost any kinetic round in the game from the front. However a HEAT-FS round will penetrate right though the armour. It also lacks any ERA or composite protection, its rear armour is 30 mm thick, the flat sides have an additional 10 mm plate bringing their total thickness to 40 mm, and the roof is a measly 20 mm thick.

In order to stay alive, it is important to always have your front pointing towards the enemy. Its 105 mm L74 cannon is able to offer a maximum penetration of 303 mm. It may seem low compared to other tanks in-game, however with a skilled commander who utilise the map and who can stay stealthy is able to become the Tanker version of the legendary Viking called Erik the Red.

One of the great advantages of this tank is its pure survivability, its crew is all located behind the engine and transmission. However one of the weaknesses is also this crew survivability, any shot that is able to penetrate from the side will knockout the engine and transmission, worse case causing fires or disabling the tank in combat allowing the enemy tanker to flank to the rear or sides and fire a single shot into the Strv 103-0 ammo racks or crew compartments.

The ideal playstyle is to play the tank as an ambusher, stay in the bushes then pop out and fire, reverse and then move to another location, with the idea being to press the attack from their rear and cause mayhem, however if you stay at range, it can function well as a sniper thanks to its good gun depression, rangefinder, small profile and good reverse speed.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Operational with only 1 crew member remaining
- The gun has good penetration and damage
- Four second reload time makes it much easier to knock out enemy tanks
- The frontal armour is heavily sloped, which makes it quite tough even though being only 40 mm thick
- Has a tiny profile, making it much easier to hide in realistic and simulator battles
- Because the engine is located at the front most shots will not go through the whole tank if they penetrate and will simply be absorbed
- Has a 10 mm gun shield that will block most shrapnel.

'''Cons:'''

- The sloped frontal armour becomes redundant if angled incorrectly
- Very thin side and rear armour, any gun larger than a machine gun can go through
- The turret is fixed to the hull and cannot swivel
- APFSDS and APDS shells will go straight through the lower front plate, most of the time no matter the angle
- Very vulnerable front lower glacis plate

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Strv 103-0 is the prototype series before the head series with Strv 103A was delivered to the Swedish army. After the trial of the two trial vehicles S1 and S2 in 1961, Sweden ordered 10 pre-series Strv 103 which would become the 0-series. They were not finished until 1963, where they were put on trial to be combined with different vehicles to see how to efficiently utilize the tank system in squad and organization attempts. These attempts would have a great impact on how the Strv 103 would be shaped and molded and so the evaluation of the Strv 103 began that would last from 1963 till 1966. It only took half a year before it was decided that the Strv 103 "S" would become Sweden's new tank.

The trials with the 0-series worked well, the test results from the field testings, squad and organization attempts were favourable for the Strv 103-0 and it was not until 1964 that Sweden placed an order in a total value of around 500 million kr (SEK) which would total in 70 Strv 103 being produced to the first main series Strv 103 which would be designated [[Strv 103A]]. The main series tank order delivery started by 1967 giving the 0-series to be put to trials until the end of 1966.

=== [[wt:en/news/6505-development-strv-103-0-last-man-standing-en|Devblog]] ===
In the immediate postwar years, Sweden began looking for a replacement to the Centurion tanks, then in service with its army. The most straightforward solution was to once again look into the export market for potential candidates, although engineers were already working on a domestic design - the Kranvagn. While this process was ongoing, an engineer by the name of Sven Berge came up with a radical new tank design in 1956.

This new vehicle featured a turretless design with a cannon fixed to the hull, which would be trained onto its targets with the precise use of an adjustable suspension system. The design was based on results from a study on tank crew casualties during WWII and the Korean War, which showed a correlation between tank height and hit probability. As such, the 'S-Tank' was kept very small in dimensions and low in profile, while also utilizing some innovative new engineering solutions, such as a mixed power plant consisting of a diesel engine and a gas turbine.

In 1959, the Swedish government approved the construction and testing of two prototypes. In 1960, a pre-production batch of 10 vehicles of the '0-serie' was ordered for field trials, which went on into the mid '60s. Generating more than favorable test results, the vehicle was formally ordered into production and procured as the 'Stridsvagn 103'.

Despite its original purpose being to replace the Centurion tanks in the Swedish Army, the Strv 103 ended up serving alongside it for a number of decades, until it was ultimately decommissioned in the late 1990s. By that time, 290 Strv 103s were built, spanning over five variants.
