== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Raining Fire"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Notes''':

- Ammo rack 5 is a ready rack. It has a capacity of 6 projectiles.
- Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready rack 6. If the ready rack is empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
- Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-4 into rack 5. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.
- The ammo rack depletion order is: 6 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5.
- Ammo racks on the floor are emptied by removing the most left top shell in a rack.
- Packing 17&nbsp;''(+31)'' shells creates a relatively safe layout for front engagements without excessive risk of ammo explosion.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Thanks to the ERA, the front is relatively immune to most HEATFS shells
- Effective top speed
- Has an unlockable APFSDS shell which can deal with pretty much anything it faces

'''Cons:'''

- Armour is the same as the Centurion Mk 10, but must face stronger ammunition
- APFSDS is an tier 4 modification

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

During the 80s, it was found necessary to do something about the oldest Centurions in Swedish service, which were mostly worn out. The decision was therefore made to let 80 of the Strv 102s undergo a chassis modification in the period 1983-1987. In order to find out what type of powertrain should be chosen, a tank had been sent over to Vickers in England where it was fitted with a diesel engine and the same type of gearbox as in the [[Chieftain (Family)|Chieftain]]. It underwent comparative testing with a Centurion chassis procured in 1977 from Israel. This turretless tank was fitted with a powertrain assembled in Holland, a Continental diesel engine of the same type as in the [[M60 (Family)|M60 "Patton"]] and an Allison automatic transmission.<ref name="ointres_Centurion">Lindström 2014</ref>

The American-Israeli concept proved superior to the English one, which the Swedish army ordered as an upgrade for eighty selected tanks. With the 1983-1987 upgrade of the older tanks to a configuration that received the designation Stridsvagn 104, the technical life was extended to the year 2000.<ref name="ointres_Centurion" />
