== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was an upgraded version of the Strv 102R, with improved suspension for the tracks, thermal cameras, and new driver hatch. The Strv 105 was decided in the 1990s to complement FVM's procurement of acquiring new tanks for the Swedish armed forces. However, only one prototype was ever built, and the type never entered service due to Sweden acquiring [[Strv 121]] and the vehicle platform became obsolete.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Strv 105 is a clear upgrade over the [[Strv 104]] with a similar playstyle. The {{PAGENAME}} comes with thermals, better APFSDS rounds and slight better performance in mobility which is needed due to the {{PAGENAME}} facing more fearsome opponents compared to [[Strv 104]]. The {{PAGENAME}} is a vehicle that players should take great precaution in: being a Centurion, it's not the fastest or most manoeuvrable vehicle and can face some very dangerous opponents that can outperform it very heavily in terms of speed, manoeuvrability, and firepower. This makes the {{PAGENAME}} a better vehicle to support teammates or shoot from a distance where its ERA can protect it better against HEAT-FS and HESH rounds, though it is still very vulnerable to APFSDS rounds. However, it is not by any means a useless vehicle, facing similar opponents like the [[Sho't Kal Dalet]], and can still put up a fight against any opponent with its Slpprj m/90C round giving it a similar penetration performance to DM23.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour is very lacking to say the least. The only notable thing to say about its armour is that it can take hits from most autocannons and that from the front, the "Blazer" ERA enables this tank to survive against HEAT munitions. Also keep in mind that there is a large gap in the ERA on the right side of the turret face, as there are modules blocking the installation of ERA. But if hit in the turret from the front there is a high chance of survival unlike getting hit from the hull because of internal structural steel enabling rounds to create more fragments.

'''Armour type:'''
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Strv 105 is an upgraded variant of the [[Strv 104]], based off the [[Centurion Mk 10]]. With new upgrades such as thermal imaging and the m/90C APFSDS round (Swedish designation for the Israeli M426 105 mm APFSDS), it can handle most targets it faces including some later MBTs such as the [[Leopard 2A4]], [[M1 Abrams]], and the [[T-72 (Family)|T-72s]] and [[T-80 (Family)|T-80s]].

It is best to snipe from a position where the enemy can't see you, as the m/90c round has enough penetration over range to penetrate enemies from a distance, and the armour isn't really strong against other opponents. While it has an upgraded engine, the Strv 105 still is a bit sluggish compared to NATO counterparts and vehicles such as the [[XM-803]] or [[Leopard 1A5]] can beat you in mobility terms. It's best to try to stay cover to cover when moving. Defeating late Cold War-era MBTs in uptiers can be done but thanks to their mobility and gun handling control being more advanced, they will often have a better reaction time than you.

;'''Enemies worth noting:'''

* [[T-72B]], [[T-72B (1989)]] - These Soviet MBTs have their armour increased on the frontal hull and with the 1989 variant featuring CONTACT-5 ERA, it will be impossible to kill them from the front except for a few weak spots. It's best to aim for the lower front plate and the driver port.
* [[Challenger Mk.2]]/[[Challenger Mk.3]] - The turret of these British tanks will be nearly impossible to penetrate at range, due to how the composite plates are angled. The lower hull can be penetrated though, especially around the driver port or the lower front plate.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to the m/90c APFSDS shell (aka 105 mm DM63/M426) with good penetration
* Improved engine
* ERA stops most HEATFS
* Stock APFSDS shell
* NVDs are a Tier II modification
* Good gun depression (-10°)
* Has no hull ammo storage next to the driver unlike the earlier [[Strv 101]]

'''Cons:'''

* Mobility is subpar compared to other MBTs
* Weak armour against most APDS/APFSDS, even from Soviet APHE shells
* Late Cold War-era vehicles may be difficult to deal with in uptiers
* Lower front plate has no additional protection
