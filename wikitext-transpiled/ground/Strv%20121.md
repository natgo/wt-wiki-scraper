== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
[[File:Strv 121 Armour.png|250px|thumb|Frontal armour display of the Strv 121.]]
The Strv 121's kinetic protection is reasonable, with the turret cheeks near-invulnerable to all but the most powerful rounds (e.g. CL3143) and the upper front plate capable of protecting against less powerful rounds (e.g. M735) - however besides these sections the remainder of the vehicle is largely vulnerable to high-powered kinetic rounds; of note are the weak lower front plate and the gun mantlet, both of which are reasonably visible targets, as well as the gunner's optics.

The vehicle sports significantly better all-round chemical protection, with an upper hull and turret essentially immune to all but the most powerful ATGMs frontally, with upwards of 800 mm worth of equivalent protection in places. Despite this, it's advisable to be wary of incoming ATGMs as a well-placed round may sneak past the heavily protected areas - and some missiles such as those of the ADATS will slice straight through even the turret cheeks.

As with most other MBTs, the Strv 121 is particularly vulnerable from the sides and back.

The Strv 121 is reasonably survivable, with some degree of crew spacing. However, from certain angles, the crew are placed in a straight line and successful penetration may impact three of the four crew members, resulting in a crew knock-out. In addition, well-placed side shots may impact all three turret crew members.

Ammunition is stored in the primary ammunition storage in the rear of the turret, or in the secondary storage next to the driver. The primary rack provides crew protection through the use of blow-out panels, however only has space for 15 rounds. When more than 16 rounds are taken to battle, ammunition will be stored in the significantly more vulnerable hull rack.

The Strv 121's protection proves acceptable for long-range combat, although it's ill-advised to remain in one location for any extended period of time to avoid opposing vehicles being able to hone their shots onto your weak spots. The Strv 121's protection should not be relied upon in urban or other close-range environments.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=2,032|rbMinHp=1,327}}

The {{PAGENAME}} is powered by an {{Annotation|MTU|MOTOREN-UND TURBINEN-UNION FRIEDRICHSHAFEN GMBH}} MB 838 Ca-M500 engine which produces a whopping 1,500 hp (1,100 kW), resulting in a power-to-weight ratio of slightly over 27 hp per tonne, comparable to the ratio of the early Abrams and identical to the T-80U. As such, the {{PAGENAME}} is quite mobile despite weighing over 55 tonnes, comfortably able to reach 72 km/h on-road and well capable of keeping up with its competitors. This allows for an active, aggressive playstyle, using the Leopard's high speed and good acceleration characteristics to get into an early flanking position or take early cap points - though it is important to keep in mind that opposition forces might attempt the same.

The {{PAGENAME}} has a maximum reverse speed of 31 km/h which it reaches easily, allowing for a quick retreat in sub-optimal situations.

{{main|kan Strv 121 (120 mm)}}

The 120 mm kan Strv 121 is a domestic production of the famous 120 mm [[Rheinmetall L44 (120 mm)|Rheinmetall L/44]] cannon and is mounted as the primary armament on the Strv 121, offering a balance of firepower, accuracy, and sustained rate of fire. The 121 has three rounds available to it: slsgr m/95, DM13 APFSDS and DM23 APFSDS. Of these, only DM13 is available when the vehicle is stock, with slsgr m/95 as a tier 2 and DM23 a tier 4 modification. The L/44 is reasonably accurate at long range with any ammunition, however minor round deviation may be evident at extreme ranges (over 2,000 m).

It's advisable to primarily rely on the best available APFSDS round for engaging other MBTs. HE should rarely be used but can prove to be useful for more experienced players.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Strv 121 may feel somewhat sluggish when stock, but unlike the German [[Leopard 2A4]] that the Strv 121 is based off of, the 121 gets DM13 stock. This allows for more aggressive early research play than its German brother.

The 121 can be used comfortably in both urban and rural environments, providing the vehicle's weaknesses are kept in mind. While it is capable in most forms of engagement, it does lack the precision of the British Challenger MBTs or the extreme round velocities of the Russian T-64/T-80 series. The 121 also has a particularly large and blocky profile, making for a particularly visible target in many situations.

Considering the above, a Strv 121 player should utilize its great mobility and competitive gun to get into early positions to pick off unsuspecting targets, rather than attempting to engage opposing forces head-on.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful engine, high top speed and acceleration
* Good neutral steering system
* Good gunner sight magnification for long-range engagements
* Reasonably high-velocity kinetic rounds
* Competitive DM23 APFSDS
* Turret armour can prove effective for hull-down engagements
* Primary ammunition is contained within a storage unit with blow-out panels

'''Cons:'''

* Hull armour is mediocre, particularly against kinetic rounds
* The gunner's optics are a weak spot, enemies who know how to aim can cripple your gun and kill your crew
* The gun mantlet is relatively weak while being quite prominent, penetration can disable the gun or knock turret crew out
* The turret cheeks can be penetrated by most APFSDS rounds when hit at the right angle
* Secondary ammunition storage is extremely vulnerable, although this is avoidable by carrying no more than 16 rounds
* Both machine guns are relatively light calibre, suffer from mediocre gun elevation and will not prove to be much more an annoyance to aircraft, particularly helicopters
* Does not get access to HEAT-FS like the 2A4, instead gets access to the slsgr m/95 HE round as a tier II modification

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

When the Swedish Military decided to procure the German-built Leopard Improved (Strv 122), they decided to also lease Leopard 2A4 tanks from Germany as part of the deal. 160 Leopard 2A4s were delivered in 1994, with the stipulation that they would be returned after 15 years. The Bundeswehr was willing to loan out their tanks because of the requirement that they reduce the amount of military equipment in service, due to the end of the Cold War. When the contract ended, 20 vehicles were purchased and kept<ref>http://ointres.se/strv_121_och_strv_122.htm</ref>.

The Swedish Leopard 2A4s were designated as the Stridsvagn (Strv) 121. They came from various production series - known as losung - from losung 1 (built in 1979) to losung 5 (built in 1987). As such, there were some minor external variations among the Strv 121 tanks.
