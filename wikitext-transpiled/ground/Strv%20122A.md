== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Stridsvagn 122A''' is the Swedish first subvariant for the [[Leopard 2A5]], which is the sixth variant of the [[Leopard 2 (Family)|Leopard 2 main battle tank family]]. The Stridsvagn 122A is distinguished from the Leopard 2A5 largely by the French GALIX smoke dispensers, different storage bins, and thicker crew hatches. Everything else remains the same as on standard Leopard 2A5. The Leopard 2A5 (launched in mid-1998) differs from previous variants in appearance due to the addition of wedge-shaped spaced add-on armour over the entire front as well as the forward sides of the turret. This wedge-shaped space add-on armour is designed to deflect and erode kinetic-energy penetrators as well as neutralize a hollow charge before it reaches the base armour. The shot-trap effect was investigated and avoided as a result of the first layer, which does not deflect penetrators into the hull, as well as angle calculations and the material utilized for the outer layer. As a result, the gun mantlet had been altered to accommodate the new wedge-shaped spaced add-on armour. In addition, the complete composite armour composition has been altered and improved. Spall liners were fitted in the crew compartment to prevent fragmentation, and the frontal area of the side skirts was upgraded and fortified. The turret traverse and systems were completely electric to decrease weight and simplify maintenance and reliability. The tank commander's vision was placed beyond the hatch, and thermal imaging equipment was fitted separately. The gunner's sight was also moved to the turret roof (earlier versions had it incorporated into the front turret armour cavity). The driver's hatch has been modified as well. The entire gun brake system was updated because this type was scheduled to be upgraded to the new 120 mm Rheinmetall L/55 tank gun in the future [[Leopard 2A6|Leopard 2A6 variant]].

Introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]], the Stridsvagn 122A variant provides higher turret protection than the preceding [[Strv 121|Stridsvagn 121]] variant due to the addition of wedge-shaped spaced add-on armour covering the frontal area and forward flanks of the turret. Despite the fact that it is a spaced add-on armour, the characteristic wedge-shaped design effectively disrupts and reduces the energy of incoming enemy tank ammunition rounds, resulting in significant armour penetration reduction. The tank layouts are identical to the Stridsvagn 121, however, crew positions alter slightly. The tank commander's sight has been significantly enhanced, giving him an independent sight equipped with thermal imaging equipment, which offers hunter-killer capabilities.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.''

{{main|kan Strv 122 (120 mm)}}

The 120 mm kan Strv 122 is a Swedish license-produced version of the [[Rheinmetall L44 (120 mm)|Rheinmetall L/44]], and has access to slpprj m/95 APFSDS rounds. However, players who have not unlocked it yet, or who cannot afford the cost of said ammunition on an already exorbitantly expensive tank to repair, will be treated to the DM23 round, which, whilst adequate for most targets, is less reliable.

The gun handling is excellent, featuring a fast turret traverse and fast gun elevation akin to most of its contemporaries, such as the [[M1A2 Abrams|M1A2]] and [[Leopard 2A5]]. The reload is also comparable to the M1A2 and 2A5, being able to go down to 6.0 s. This is slower than other MBTs such as the [[Type 90 (B)]] and [[Challenger 2 (2F)]], and as fast as the [[Leclerc]], which benefits from an autoloader.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|ksp 94 (7.62 mm)}}

The Strv 122 possesses a coaxial and a pintle-mounted 7.62 mm machine gun. Whilst ineffective against armour, they are able to deal with bushes, and lucky shots against aircraft may set their engine ablaze or hit their pilot.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Playing like the average Main Battle Tank should suffice. Compared to most tanks, the frontal armour and turret are better protected, meaning the tank can be played more aggressively. Hiding the lower mantlet is still required to avoid opponents exploiting a weak point.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* A very well armoured MBT with even fewer weak spots (UFP)
* There is a thick layer composite armour covering the roof
* Good speed and manoeuvrability
* Equipped with high-penetrating APFSDS shells and powerful HE shells
* Gen 2 thermal sights for the commander, with a well elevated commander view

'''Cons:'''

* Lower frontal plate is still a weak spot
* Turret ring is the main target for enemy tanks

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==
<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
