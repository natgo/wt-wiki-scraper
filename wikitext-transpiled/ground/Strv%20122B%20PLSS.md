== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Strv 122B carries on all the good armour from the previous 122A model, but gains a 20 mm steel plate on the LFP and underbelly, as well as having a remodelled hull ammunition rack. The plate helps stop ricocheting shells, and can be a layer of defence against explosive and chemical penetration rounds. The new hull ammunition rack is wider but has an overall lower height - meaning that shells entering the LFP and passing through the bottom of the tank's interior may now pass under the shells without hitting the racks.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The same great protection of the Strv 122A, with an addition of an LFP/belly armour plate!
* The Saab Panoramic, Low-Silhouette Sight (PLSS) commander CITV allows the user to spot enemies from fully turret-down positions, exposing only the sight while hiding the turret and hull
* The added armour doesn't affect mobility, meaning the 122B is just as agile as the previous 122A
* One of the best armoured Western tanks - the combination of roof armour, UFP armour, and good mobility means the 122B is a very potent breakthrough tank
* Fits the all-round playstyle very well, working both as a sniper and a brawler

'''Cons:'''

* The PLSS CITV sticks out, and can be a potential death trap if enemies fire HE shells, such as the Russian 3OF26, at it
* While the hull ammunition storage is better laid out than on the 122A, carrying more than 15+1 shells is still a big risk to take
* The NERA on the upper glacis and turret cheeks can be shot off easily, meaning that protection decreases as you take damage, potentially leaving you very vulnerable when it has fallen off
