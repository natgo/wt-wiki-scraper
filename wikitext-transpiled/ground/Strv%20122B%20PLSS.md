== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Strv 122B carries on all the good armour from the previous 122A model, but gains a 20 mm steel plate on the LFP and underbelly, as well as having a remodelled hull ammunition rack. The plate helps stop ricocheting shells, and can be a layer of defence against explosive and chemical penetration rounds. The new hull ammunition rack is wider but has an overall lower height - meaning that shells entering the LFP and passing through the bottom of the tank's interior may now pass under the shells without hitting the racks.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The same great protection of the Strv 122A, with an addition of an LFP/belly armour plate!
* The Saab Panoramic, Low-Silhouette Sight (PLSS) commander CITV allows the user to spot enemies from fully turret-down positions, exposing only the sight while hiding the turret and hull
* The added armour doesn't affect mobility, meaning the 122B is just as agile as the previous 122A
* One of the best armoured Western tanks - the combination of roof armour, UFP armour, and good mobility means the 122B is a very potent breakthrough tank
* Fits the all-round playstyle very well, working both as a sniper and a brawler

'''Cons:'''

* The PLSS CITV sticks out, and can be a potential death trap if enemies fire HE shells, such as the Russian 3OF26, at it
* While the hull ammunition storage is better laid out than on the 122A, carrying more than 15+1 shells is still a big risk to take
* The NERA on the upper glacis and turret cheeks can be shot off easily, meaning that protection decreases as you take damage, potentially leaving you very vulnerable when it has fallen off

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In 1994, the Swedish Army first purchased 150 [[Leopard 2A4]]s from Germany in stock (all the first five batches produced), which were delivered in 1994 and 1995, designated by the Swedish Army as [[Strv 121]], and later improved to the level of the [[Leopard 2A5]]. After that, the Swedish Army continued to evaluate the procurement of a second batch of more advanced main tanks, and in 1999 held tests with the modern NATO tanks of the 1990s: the American [[M1A2 Abrams]], the German Leopard 2A5, the French [[Leclerc]] and the British [[Challenger 2]].

During the trials, the Leopard 2A5 defeated various strong opponents (in order of test results: Leopard 2A5, M1A2, Leclerc, Challenger-2) and won orders from the Swedish Army. The Swedish Army ordered 120 Leopard 2A5s, which they also modified to their own specifications, and were given the designation [[Strv_122A|Strv 122]] (the Germans refer to this Swedish variant as the ''Leopard 2S'') The contract also includes related training simulators, parts, training and logistics support, and industrial reciprocity, in addition to Sweden's priority option to purchase an additional 90 vehicles.

The chassis of the Strv 122 was built by KraussMaffei and Hgglunds of Sweden, the turret was produced by Mak in cooperation with Bofors in Sweden, and the firing control system was integrated by STN Atlas Elektronik and Celsius Tech Systems AB of Sweden. In addition, Bofors still produces 50% of the main gun components. The Strv 122 combines advanced technology from Bofors, Ericsson and Celsius, and has been enhanced with enhanced protection. The Strv 122 is considered one of the most sophisticated and protected version of the Leopard 2 series.
