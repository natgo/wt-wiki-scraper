== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a testing bench and technology demonstration unit for improved protection on existing [[Strv 122]] units. The proposed prototype was to be produced around 2010-2011 and form part of a modernization programme for the Strv 122. The {{PAGENAME}} was designed to improve protection against threats in urban combats and got additional protection against different type of explosive threats that can be lethal for an vehicle in urban situations and close combat. However, these additional protection kits were never put in the modernization of the Strv 122s.

The {{PAGENAME}} was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]] as a new top tier MBT for Sweden, coming with improved protection against chemical rounds and shaped charged ATGMs bolstering the survivability of the vehicle. Still having the same 120 mm L/44 gun compared to the [[Leopard 2A6]] and [[Leopard 2A7V]] with their 120 mm L/55, it would seem the {{PAGENAME}} is inferior in terms of firepower and penetration, but this is not an issue for it due to it still being competitive at top tier. Even with additional armour, the {{PAGENAME}} is still highly manoeuvrable with its additional weight and doesn't affect the speed at all. The {{PAGENAME}} still has vulnerable areas on the hull against kinetic rounds and, like its predecessors, excels in a hull-down playstyle, exposing only the well armoured and protected turret to peek out and fire at enemy units. Angling the armour of the hull with the additional armour gives it better chance to survive close combat engagements than other Leopard 2s.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The outward of Strv 122B+ looks pretty like its predecessor [[Strv 122B PLSS]]. There are a few of upgrades on the armour protection. The turret sides are now covered with 80 mm thick of composite screen, which makes the ammo rack in the turret more resistant to most autocannon shells with lower penetration of 130 mm. The frontal part of hull sides is also covered with 260~270 mm thick of composite armour, which can now devour some most powerful tandem ATGMs when the Strv 122B+ is angling itself. Although the Strv 122B+ isn't equipped with the Saab commander CITV from the Strv 122B PLSS, it also has the mine protection modification which adds additional 30 mm thick of RHA on its belly. In sum, the Strv 122B+ remains most features of armour protection from the Strv 122B PLSS while enhencing the side protection against autocannon shells and ATGMs. 

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (sides, back and roof of hull, back and roof of turret, turret ring, underbody, commander optics, driver cupola)
* High hardness rolled armour (hull front, front and sides of turret, side skirts)
* Structural steel (applique armour on turret roof)
* Composite screen (turret cupolas, frontal part of side skirts, applique armour on hull front, external armour on front and sides of turret)
* External composite armour with NERA elements (gun mantlet)
* Cast homogeneous armour (upper front of turret)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and tracks are 20 mm thick, and the underbody is 20 mm thick.
* There is an 8 mm thick internal RHA screen that separates the crew compartment from the engine. The two exterior fuel tanks at the frontal part of the hull sides are separated from the crew compartment by two 35 mm thick of internal RHA screens.
* The ammo rack in the turret is separated by a 35 mm thick of internal RHA screen.
* There are a few 10 mm thick attached tracks mounted on the rear of the turret.
* The external arrow-shaped armour and the applique armour on the turret are 80 mm thick and can be torn down.
* There is 140 mm thick roof composite armour around two turret cupolas, and several 10 and 20 mm thick structural steel plates cover the composite armour inside.
* The smoke dispensers are protected by a RHA shell.
* With the modification of Mine Protection, a 30 mm thick external RHA plate is attached to the underbody.
* There are several plates of spall liner at the frontal hull sides, top of turret, and around the hull ammo rack.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list.
