The Strv m/38 is armed with a 8 mm ksp m36 machine gun, useful for hitting lightly armoured AA vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Strv m/38 provides the player with a fast, manoeuvrable light tank boasting effective firepower for its BR. As a light tank, the armour cannot be relied upon to stop enemy fire, being too weak to stop even .50 cal MG fire. However, it has access to APDS, which allows it to punch through all opponents at its BR and even most tanks a rank above. Because of the excellent APDS shell, it is advised to keep it as your primary shell, but keep a few APBC shells to finish lighter opponents, as the APDS has poor post-penetration damage.

Even with weak armour, the Strv m/38 can be reliably depended upon even in uptiers with its speed, and as well as its penetration power (with the APDS shell), matching the likes of the German [[Pz.III]] series. The only drawback to this shell is the poor post-penetration damage, which calls for a playstyle relying on well-placed shots on enemy vehicles. This is why it's advised to aim for the turret or engine using the APDS shell, when unsure if your APBC shell will actually penetrate at all.

On rough uneven terrain, a viable tactic is to use your excellent gun depression to hit tanks on from a hull-down position.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has access to a high-penetrating APDS shell with an amazing 105 mm of penetration
* Effective in up-tiers with the APDS against heavy targets like the [[B1 bis]] and the [[Valentine I]]
* Quick reload rate
* Good -10° of gun depression means that it can adapt to different terrains well
* Has a small size compared to other reserve tanks
* Effective mobility - max speed of 51 km/h

'''Cons:'''

* APDS round has no explosive filler, multiple shots will be needed to finish off an enemy
* Has a slow reverse speed (-6 km/h) that may put the player at risk
* Armour is inadequate to resist any shells
* 5 mm roof armour can be penetrated by common aircraft, such as the ones with 12.7 mm and 20 mm guns

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Landsverk L-60 was a Swedish tank developed in 1934, and included several advanced design features such as torsion bar suspension, periscopes rather than view slits and all-welded construction. The Strv m/38 was the earliest variant of the L-60 accepted into Swedish service, with 15 ordered in 1937 and delivered in 1939. Unlike other exported variants of the L-60, the m/38 did not see combat use due to Swedish neutrality during the Second World War.
