== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Starfighters"]] as a reward for [[wt:en/news/6751-watch-streams-on-twitch-get-rewards-en|watching War Thunder streams on Twitch.tv]] along with a unique skin for the vehicle. This vehicle shouldn't be confused as a tank destroyer (TD) by its designation, TD in this case stands for '''T'''witch '''D'''rop.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Still effective in up-tiers, since it has access to a high-penetrating APDS shell with an amazing 105 mm penetration and high velocity
- Amazing -15 degrees gun depression means that it can adapt different terrains very well
- Fast reload, up to 3.1 seconds with an aced crew
- Decent turret armour, offering up to 35 mm at the front and with sloping for increased protection.
- Fast top speed up to 45 km/h
- Is a small target

'''Cons:'''

- Only 3 crew members
- Armour is inadequate to resist high-penetrating shells, for example a [[Pz.II (Family)|Pz.II]] can penetrate it frontally
- Slow turret traverse speed with 11.2°/s
- Very average reverse speed of -7 km/h
- 5-8 mm roof armour can be penetrated by common aircraft such as ones with 12.7 mm M2, and [[He 112 A-0]]
- Purple stripes may be eye-catching, decreasing its concealment

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
