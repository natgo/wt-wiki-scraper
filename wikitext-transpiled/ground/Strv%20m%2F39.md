== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!--''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->
The Strv m/39 has a similar gameplay style to the [[Strv m/38]]. It's a fast light manoeuvrable tank with excellent firepower and adequate protection for its battle rating. Unlike the predecessor m/38, the m/39 got a more heavily armoured frontal turret with 50 mm thickness, making it an excellent hulled down vehicle. The Strv m/39 like its predecessor has an excellent gun depression and is able to look over hills without exposing itself too much to the enemies.

The Strv m/39 has an APDS round at a very low BR, which gives it a good advantage in long distance engagements and against more heavily armoured vehicles. While the APDS has a high penetration, it has a mediocre post-penetration damage, making it hard to take out the spaced out crew members with a single hit in big vehicles like the [[LVT(A)(1)]] or the [[T-28 (Family)|T-28]]. This forces the player to aim properly at crew positions and modules on the tanks, giving the enemy time to return fire.

The Strv m/39 is good at getting quickly to locations, making it an excellent vehicle to hit and run, ambush with and get quickly to capture points. The best part of the Strv m/39 is being able to utilize the terrains with a lot of hills on certain maps to its advantage, making it a dangerous target to face in the hands of a good player.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Still effective in up-tiers, since it has access to a high-penetrating APDS shell with an amazing 105mm penetration and high velocity
* Amazing -15 degrees gun depression means that it can adapt different terrains very well
* Fast reload, up to 3.1 seconds with an ACE crew.
* Decent turret armour, offering up to 35mm at the front and with sloping for increased protection.
* Fast top speed up to 45 km/h
* Is a small target


'''Cons:'''

* Only 3 crew members
* Armour is inadequate to resist high-penetrating shells, for example a [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]] can penetrate it frontally
* Slow turret traverse speed with 11.2°/s
* Very average reverse speed of -7 km/h
* 5-8 mm roof armour can be penetrated by common aircraft such as ones with 12.7 mm M2, and [[He 112 A-0|He-112 A0]]

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Strv m/39 is a continued design from the Strv m/38. In 1939, KAF had started discussions about ordering 20 new Strv m/38s to improve the strength of the armoured company and, seeing the international way of designing tanks equipped with cannons, they requested that new designs of Strv m/38 should have improved armour by making it thicker to combat this threat. AB Landsverk was against it since the construction of the L-60-S (Strv m/38) would not be able to handle this request of the additional weight the new armour would add to it. And because of this made them a contract that there would be small changes to the L-60-S, mainly modifications to the turret adding room for an additional machine gun to be placed. Additionally, there would a new control system for the tank, Strv m/38 had the old system using a steering wheel, the new tank would use lever steering which was more favourable.

When the contract was signed for these new tanks 19 December 1939, the new improved tank got the designation L-60-S/II and was supposed to be delivered in middle of October 1940, but trouble and delays for the 37 mm Bofors cannons for the tanks delayed it until Spring 1941 which at time tanks had improved a lot and there was demand for thicker armour again. They wanted to increase the frontal armour of the L-60-S/II from 15 to 50 mm but this would only happen in case of combat that it would be added as add-on armour onto the tanks. But during exercise the tanks would not have this additional armour on them to not wear out the new vehicles. L-60-S/II would get the designation Strv m/39 by the army.

The Strv m/39 was in use till 1957.
