== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Strv m/40L is essentially the [[Strv m/38]] with increased frontal armour. The frontal hull armour is increased to a maximum of 43 mm, while the turret is uparmoured to 50 mm. This provides a decent degree of protection against autocannons and heavy machine guns as well as low calibre anti-tank guns. However, the rest of the tank's armour profile remains identical (13 mm), and it is thus still very vulnerable from directions other than the front.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 220|rbMinHp= 126}}

The engine of the Strv m/40L is identical to that on the Strv m/38. However, the tank is considerably heavier due to the increased armour, thus somewhat worsening its acceleration. Mobility characteristics are otherwise almost identical to its predecessor.

{{main|kan m/38 (37 mm)}}

The Strv m/40L uses the same '''3,7 cm kan m/38''' gun as the Strv m/38. The turret mounting has been modified, however, to provide an even greater amount of gun depression (15°). The ammunition choice is identical: it starts with the unremarkable '''slpprj m/38''' APBC shot. At tier IV, the '''slpgr m/39''' APBC and '''slpprj m/49''' APDS rounds can be unlocked. The former round has a small explosive filler while having only slightly less penetration than the stock APBC shot. The APDS round has over 100 mm of penetration at close range and a muzzle velocity of 1,150 m/s and is capable of penetrating anything the Strv m/40L is likely to face. The high velocity makes it good for sniping, but the APDS round tends to be less accurate than the APBC rounds.

It should be noted that if the "Camera from tank gunner sight" option is enabled, there is a protrusion in front of the gunner's sight that can block part of the gunner's sight view when depressing the gun.

The Strv m/40L is a light tank with a large bite for its small calibre. Being armed with a 37 mm Bofors gun doesn't seem like a huge threat to most tanks that it faces, as its contemporaries will often equip similar or larger calibres. However, unlike other nations' tanks, the Strv m/40L is able to research potent APDS rounds.

The Strv m/40L excels in hull-down combat where it can exploit its outstanding gun depression and relatively good rounded turret armour. The powerful APDS round allows it to easily penetrate and disable even the heaviest of tanks it can normally encounter, such as the [[B1 bis]] and [[Valentine Mk I|Valentine]]. However, it has relatively weak post-penetration effects, and will often require multiple shots to destroy larger tanks due to the larger crew compartments. The tank's mobility is quite respectable and allows it to keep up with other medium tanks and making it able to move around the battlefield with ease, not only fighting from hull down positions but also bringing the fight to the enemy side. The frontal armour is quite good, but quite thin elsewhere making the tank vulnerable to side shots and rear shots so it is best to always point the frontal armour towards the enemy.

Strv m/40L might have a lot of positives to it but there are also negative sides. Until the APDS round is researched, it has to deal with using the Slpprj m/38 and Slpgr m/39 APBC rounds which have 59/55 mm penetration at 10 m forcing it to fight up close and personal. The APDS also does not hit accurately at longer distances, making it mostly useful at medium range to close range to be a fully effective round. Though forward mobility is good, Strv m/40L lacks the means to reverse away out of danger, making it better for it to turn around fast and drive back into cover. Though doing that exposes the Strv m/40L's weak side armour and possibly the rear armour which will be a good chance for the enemy to knock it out with ease.

Enemies to be aware of include tanks like [[M4A3 (105)]], [[Pz.IV E]] and [[StuG III A]], which have HEAT rounds that will easily knock out the Strv m/40L. With the crew compartment being so compact they can easily take out the 3 man crew with one shot making a lot of these targets a priority enemy for the Strv m/40L. Targets with large crew compartments and higher numbers of crew like [[B1 ter]], [[LVT (Family)|LVT]] and [[T-28E]] can also be a threat to the Strv m/40L as having a lot of crew can make it hard for the Strv m/40L to knock them out fast, which forces it to try to knock out the enemy tank's gun and work down its crew one by one if necessary. But taking too long will expose it to being surrounded or outflanked by nearby enemies that will come to assist the target in need.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good frontal armour
* Access to an outstanding APDS round
* Good mobility
* Fast reload
* Excellent gun depression in combination with good turret armour makes it great at hull-down

'''Cons:'''

* APDS is somewhat inaccurate at long range and lacks post-penetration damage
* Very thin armour other than on the front
* Poor reverse speed
* APDS is tier IV modification, and without it you have to shoot terrible AP shell with 59 mm of max penetration and low post-pen damage

In 1934, a new light tank was designed for Sweden by Landsverk, the L-60. It was based on the Landsverk L-10/[[Strv m/31]], but with a new torsion bar suspension system. The torsion bar suspension system was a large improvement over the Christie suspension system. The L-60 S/1 entered service with the Swedish military in 1938 as the [[Strv m/38]]. The L-60 S/1 Strv m/38 was armed with a Bofors 37 mm gun. In 1939, Sweden ordered an improved version of the Strv m/38. It was designated as the L-60 S/II Strv m/39. The Strv m/39 was armed with an improved Bofors 37 mm gun and had a new engine. During World War 2, the Strv m/39 was upgraded with additional armour welded onto the glacis and mantlet.

At the same time, there was a need for another upgrade of the Strv m/39. The turret mantlet was modified and a commander's cupola was added along with side hatches. These also received the upgraded armour of the Strv m/39, and were designated as L-60 S/III [[Strv m/40L]]. The L-60 served with the Swedish military throughout World War 2, and also became the basis of the [[L-62 ANTI II|L-62 Anti II SPAAG]] designed for Finland, which also saw service with Hungary as the 40M Nimrod. In 1960, 20 L-60 tanks were sold to the Dominican Republic by Sweden. Rebels, backed by the US Marine Corps, fought against the L-60 during the Dominican Civil War. 3 were destroyed by [[M48A1|M48 Patton III]]'s, [[M50|M50 Ontos]], and anti-tank fire. 12 were upgraded and saw service until 2002.

=== [[wt:en/news/6592-development-strv-m-40l-en|Devblog]] ===
We recently told you about the Swedish "reserve": the Strv m/31 light tank. Landsverk's work on this tank resulted in a project with the factory designation L-60, where the mistakes the m/31's trials had encountered were taken into consideration – including, among other things, problems with the suspension. The enhanced tanks were put into service under the designation Strv m/38, and Landsverk was commissioned to manufacture a series of these tanks. All 16 tanks of the m/38 series were Sweden's only armoured vehicles when WWII erupted in Europe. However, the military wasn't thoroughly satisfied with these vehicles – and, on top of that, they needed a whole lot more of them.  The outcome of future upgrades in the L-60 project were two new models: the Strv m/39 and the Strv m/40. They received a turret with a new shape, a fully upgraded engine compartment, and a set of add-on hull armour. The m/40 was equipped with an automatic gearbox and an enhanced frontal turret section to which another machine gun, not paired to the cannon, was added. The Strv m/40 was manufactured until March 1942. A total of about 100 units of this modification were released.
