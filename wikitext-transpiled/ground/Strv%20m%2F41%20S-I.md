== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]].

The {{PAGENAME}} is the first Swedish license-production variant of the Czech [[LT-38 (Family)|TNH tank design]]. It would be later improved in the second version: [[Strv m/41 S-II]].

The Strv m/41 S-I has a similar playstyle to the original [[Pz.38(t) F]], though it is equipped with a Swedish Bofors 37 mm kan m/38 which is the same cannon on the other Swedish light tanks and the [[Lago I]]. The cannon's regular APBC and APHE shells are a bit on the weaker side in terms of penetration, but it has a saving grace in its ability to use APDS rounds.

Even though the Strv m/41 S-I is a light tank, it has armour comparable to that of medium tanks like the [[Panzer III Ausf. J]] or the [[Ho-I]]. The frontal armour is as thick as 50 mm on both the hull and turret. Though it has a hard front, the sides and rears are less than desirable when it comes to armoured protection making the sides and rear vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire, autocannons, and larger cannons which will easily incapacitate the Strv m/41 S-I. Hence the Strv m/41 S-I should be aware of its surroundings and not expose the sides or rear too much for the enemy.

Similar to the [[Strv m/41 S-II]], its mobility is decent, but not the greatest to get into a good frontline position like the [[M5A1]] or [[BT-7 (Family)|BT-7]] due to the lack of speed and accelaration, making it vulnerable on the move to a position where it can play to its strengths; however, once a [[Strv m/41 S-I]] is in position, it can be a thorn in the enemies sides with its APDS rounds.

The Strv m/41 S-I, like most early Swedish light tanks, excels in an entrenched position or in an ambush position from a distance where it can depend on its APDS rounds to penetrate enemy targets at long distances. Though the APDS lacks in post-penetration damage, it can still out range most vehicles with a decent accuracy being able to even knock out vehicles like [[M10 Wolverine (Family)|M10 Wolverine]] at range with well-placed shells. The Strv m/41 also has excellent gun depression, making it very efficient at peeking over hills without exposing too much of the vehicle itself. Peeking over hills will also increase the armour protection due to the 50 mm armour being at an angle, which makes it a very efficient vehicle in higher positions.

;Enemies to be aware of:
*[[M4A1]]
*[[M4A3 (105)]]
*[[Pz.IV H]]
*[[KV-1 (L-11)]]
*[[M10 GMC]]
*[[Na-To]]
*[[T-34 (Family)|T-34]]

These vehicles have the ability to take out the Strv m/41 S-I at any range, even if it's in an hull-down position, due to their larger cannons with higher velocity which pose a threat to the small light tank. Not all of them have long barrel cannons, but they do have armour that will pose a threat to the Strv m/41; whether it is the thickness, as with the [[KV-1 (L-11)]], or the angle, like the [[M4A3 (105)]] or [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]], these will roll up with little worries if the Strv m/41 S-I is not good at aiming for weak points of the vehicles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->


'''Pros:'''

*Access to high-penetration APDS shells
*Excellent gun depression
*Fast rate of fire
*Decent frontal protection

'''Cons:'''

*Low post-penetration damage with APDS
*Thin armour
*Poor reverse speed
*Low weight so vehicle shakes violently, hard to halt and fire

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In 1939, Sweden purchased the production right of TnH light tank from Czech ČKD company, which is actually the export type of LT-38 tank. Subsequently, the Scania vabis factory began to produce this tank and obtained the number strv m/41. The Swedish self-produced tank is named Strv m/41, with a total weight of 11 tons, a length of 4.6 m, a width of 2.14 m, and a height of 2.35 m. The overall design is similar to the early model of Panzer 38 (t). The armor thickness of the body and the front of the turret is 25 mm. It uses a four-person car set, and the engine is a Scania Vasby 1664 gasoline engine, with an output power of 142 horsepower, a maximum road speed of 42 km/h, and a maximum range of 200 km. The Strv m/41 uses Swedish-made weapons. The main gun is a Bofors 37 mm m/38 tank gun, the vehicle-mounted Bofors 37 mm anti-tank gun, which can penetrate 55 mm flat armour at a distance of 200 m, and the auxiliary weapon is two 8 mm m/39 machine guns. Compared with the original Czech version, the Strv m/41 model has detailed differences in appearance. The most obvious is the addition of a periscope above the loader seat on the top of the turret, and the shape of the rear of the turret is also different. Because it took a lot of time to digest the technology and set up the production line, the Strv m/41 tank was delivered in December 1942 and completed in August 1943. It was initially equipped with the third Armored Regiment.
