== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]]. It is a Swedish license-built version of the Czechoslovak TNHP light tank, and is thus quite similar to the German [[Pz.38(t) F|PzKpfw 38(t)]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The Strv m/41 S-II's frontal armour is 50 mm thick both on the hull and turret, making the front the strongest armoured area of the vehicle. Compared to the [[Pz.38(t) F]], the Strv m/41 S-II has weaker side and rear armour making those areas easily penetrable by enemy guns. So the Strv m/41 S-II's strength in armour is by having the front pointing towards enemies at all times. The engine deck is only 10 mm thick, and is vulnerable to strafing aircraft with cannons or  heavy machine guns.

'''Armour type:'''
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret. cupola)
* Cast homogeneous armour (MG ports, commander and gunner viewports, gun mantlet)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The Strv m/41 S-II has one advantage over its counterpart [[Pz.38(t) F]] and that is higher horsepower, but it's also a bit heavier by 0.8 tons. The mobility of the Strv m/41 S-II is also almost identical to that of the PzKpfw 38(t) Ausf. F. It is more sluggish than the other Swedish tanks such as the [[Strv m/40L]], with a lower top speed and a rather slow reverse gear.

{{main|kan m/38 (37 mm)}}
The 37 mm Bofors is a decent gun but not as great as some other vehicles like the [[M3A1 Stuart]] or the [[BT-7]] that have great penetration capabilities and good damage output. The Strv m/41 S-II has slpprj m/38 and slpprj m/39 APBC rounds which can penetrate the more lightly-armoured vehicles and has some trouble with angles. However, the Strv m/41 S-II can easily take on heavier armoured vehicles once 3,7 cm slpprj m/49 APDS round is unlocked.

The part that truly differentiates the Strv m/41 from its German cousin is the gun. The Strv m/41 uses a Swedish-made 3,7 cm kan m/38 instead of the original Czechoslovak Skoda 37 mm cannon. Its performance with the '''slpprj m/38''' and '''slpgr m/39''' APBC rounds is similar to that of the Czechoslovak gun, but the Swedish gun also has access to the outstanding '''slpprj m/49''' APDS round. This round will easily penetrate anything the Strv m/41 can normally face, though it lacks the lethality of the German APCBC with explosive filler.

{{main|ksp m/36 (8 mm)}}

The Strv m/41 S-II is also armed with a coaxial '''8 mm ksp m/36''' light machine gun. There is a second, non-functional 8 mm machine gun in the hull front.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Strv m/41 S-II has a similar playstyle as the [[Pz.38(t) F]], though the Strv m/41 S-II has one particular advantage: its APDS rounds that can penetrate most enemy vehicles at its battle rating.

Having APDS at such a low battle rating makes the Strv m/41 S-II a great vehicle to do ambushes in and deal with heavier armoured vehicles like [[B1 bis]] and [[M4A3 (105)]] if it can get the first shell fired into a vital spot. It also gives the Strv m/41 S-II the capabilities to fight at longer ranges than its opponents , making the armour of the vehicle more efficient. The main drawback with APDS is its comparatively weak post-penetration damage,  having to pick off the crew of larger vehicles like [[T-28 (Family)|T-28]] and [[LVT(A)(1)]] one by one.

The Strv m/41 S-II shines if it gets to fight a vehicle on its terms, meaning to keep at a distance and wear the enemy down by using the APDS shells. The 50 mm frontal armour can be a saving grace in close quarters combat, but with the weak side armour it's best to keep distance instead rushing in. The Strv m/41 S-II can also shine in ambushes and hull-down positions where the enemy has to advance to it or do not know where it is, and it can get good shots on their sides. However, the tank can also be effective in direct confrontation, even if it is not the ideal situation.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Access to high-penetration APDS shot
* Fast rate of fire
* Decent amount of armour for a light tank
* Excellent gun depression

'''Cons:'''

* Low post-penetration damage with APDS.
* A bit sluggish with a low top speed for a light tank
* Poor reverse speed
* Chassis rocks violently when stopping making it hard to stop and shoot quickly

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In March of 1940, Sweden ordered about 90 TNH tanks (known as the Panzer 38(t) in German service) from {{Annotation|ČKD|Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk}}, but Germany, which had occupied Czechoslovakia in 1938, confiscated the tanks for its own use as the Panzer 38(t) Ausf. S. Sweden still needed the light tanks, and after negotiations the Swedish manufacturer Scania-Vabis was allowed to produce them under license, and compensation for the lost tanks. Sweden ordered 116 Strv M/41 SI in June, 1941. The Stridsvagn M/41 was armed with a 37 mm Bofors m/38 gun, was powered by a Scania-Vabis Type 1664 engine, and the design utilized riveted construction. In June of 1942, Sweden ordered 122 Strv M/41 SII. The SII featured a number of improvements over the SI. The armour was increased from 25 mm to 50 mm thick. Because of the added weight of the armour, a more powerful engine was added, the Type L 603 engine. This necessitated an elongation of the hull by 65 mm. The fuel tanks were increased from 190 litres to 230 litres. 104 of the SII model were built, with the last 18 being built as the Sav M/43, a casemate assault gun using a 75 mm gun, and later a 105 mm gun. Another 18 Sav M/43 were purpose-built afterwards. The Strv M/41 served until the late 1950s, when all Strv M/41 were converted to the Pansarbandvagn (Pbv) 301, an armoured personnel carrier. The turrets were used in static fortifications.
