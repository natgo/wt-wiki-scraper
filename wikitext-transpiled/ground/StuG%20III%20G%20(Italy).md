== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]]. It differs from the German StuG III G by the absence of Ostketten and Add-on Armour modules and by the addition of a smoke grenade launcher.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The StuG III G is best played as a support vehicle. Like the previous Semovente variants, it has excellent armour and can be quite a potent vehicle that enemies will often find hard to deal with from long ranges. Due to this, it's advised to go to a good spot overlooking common enemy positions at the beginning of the match. Make sure enemies don't breach your defenses, as the sides of the tank are a weak point from any range. Another downside of playing this vehicle is when it's brought close to the front lines (for example when capturing points). The StuG III G's armour will not be adequate against the close-range power of most vehicles. Most shots at close range will more than likely penetrate the armour, which will usually result in the vehicle being destroyed due to the small interior layout. So it is vital to maintain situational awareness when playing in a more risky playstyle. Make sure to support teammates from the flanks, attack from long ranges, and never close in the distance even for objectives unless necessary. If properly concealed, the enemy will never know where they are attacked as they concentrate their assault forwards.

The StuG III G has no defense against enemy aircraft, so if you see one heading towards you, it probably would be in you best interest to look for cover. Unlike the German variant, the Italian StuG III G does not have side skirts, so artillery might at times damage your tracks. In terms of armaments, the StuG III G is armed with the German-made 75 mm StuK40, a reliable cannon with plenty of great ammo options. Do carefully consider how many rounds are brought, as bringing more than necessary puts the vehicle at greater risk of being destroyed in one shot. In conclusion, be careful, try not to get detected by the enemy and find a place where the StuG III G can be in cover whilst engaging enemy tanks.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good frontal armour
* Low silhouette
* Powerful 75 mm cannon
* Boxy design makes it excellent for angling 

'''Cons:'''

* Fixed casemate superstructure restricts gun movement to the front
* Mediocre mobility
* Left side is vulnerable to crew knockouts

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The story of the StuG begins during the interwar period of Germany, there was a clear missing asset for the German army, a vehicle which could fit the role of a self-propelled gun, which followed the same style of doctrine thanks to combat experiences in World War I. Overall, there was a major need for a mobile artillery piece which could keep up with the German infantry and fight enemy fortifications with a direct-fire assault role. After a few prototypes and refinement to the designs, the StuG III would officially enter full-scale production from January 1940, and would serve in many countries up till the end of the war in April 1945. The main reason it saw such extensive use was due to the many upgrades done on the vehicle to increase serviceability and it being a low cost platform to maintain operational. In terms of survivability, the StuG III featured about 50 mm of armour on the front, but about 30 mm of armour everywhere else, this was upgraded to 80 mm as the war progressed. The StuG in German service also had access ''Schürzen'' armour plates installed on the hull to protect the weaker hull sides against anti-tank rifles and HEAT rounds.
[[File:StuG III G (Italy).png|thumb|StuG III G (D.M.) During Training]]
The Italian versions would remove this, as was the case for many Italian vehicles. In terms of the Italian story of this tank, Germany had initially supplied 12 units of the Panzer IV G to Italy during the late stages of the Second World War. With these tanks, as well as 12 newly-received StuG III Gs, the 1st Armored Division Black Shirts "M" (for "Mussolini") was formed in May 1943, mainly starting from the very few survivors of the previous MVSN Battalions M who had been repatriated from the Russian front. The division was organised in 3 companies, with the third comprising the 12 StuGs which were armed with 7.5 cm L/48 cannons. Unlike their German counterpart, the side-skirts were removed from the tanks, but surprisingly were also modified with a smoke grenade launcher, installed onto the turret. The Italian StuGs would be painted in a light tan colour with the Divisione "M" logo usually painted on the turret. They didn't see any action during the war, most of them were still undergoing training at the time and most, if not all of the tanks would end up in Allied hands shortly after the war.
