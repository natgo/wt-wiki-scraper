== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (or the '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.51 "Cold Steel"]]. It is similar to the Rank III [[M18 GMC|M18 Hellcat]], only using the [[M36 GMC]] turret to mount the 90 mm gun.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 7 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 11 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 7 - 1 - 2 - etc. until 6.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-6 into rack 7. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.
* Side racks empty: 26&nbsp;''(+19)'' shells.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The Super Hellcat should be very familiar to those who play the [[M18 GMC]]. It is very fast, equipped with a hard-hitting cannon, but at a cost of armour. Thus, the M18 Super Hellcat is a mobile hit-and-run vehicle, popping out from behind a cover and blasting the enemy with a shot before retreating. Change up the firing location often to avoid being hit if someone has located the Super Hellcat's position. The Hellcat won't hold the line by standing and absorbing shots, but it can if it is picking off each attacker one by one like a sniper.

The main focus of gaining the Super Hellcat is the 90 mm upgrade, and it is absolutely beautiful. The main round recommended using well be the M82 APCBC round, the reason being reliable one shot knock-outs. The M82 has enough penetration to penetrate a [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]] through the front plate.

In an offensive and defensive position, the Hellcat should still remain behind cover and be constantly changing firing positions. Once a shot was fired, retreat back to cover and wait out until the next round is reloaded. In an offence, pop out from the cover occasionally and snipe at the enemy. In a defence, remain behind cover and catch the enemy off guard as they approach by letting them shoot a different target first and hit them while they are reloading. Another way is to let them move right into the Hellcat's line of sight, which should at best expose their sides, allowing for a shot to land an M82 APCBC round into them.

A more aggressive play style is as a flanker and a point-capturer. The Hellcat's great speed can allow it to get around an enemy concentration and shoot them on the sides while they are focused at allies in front of them. They may eventually catch on to Hellcat's presence, and the Hellcat should take a more conservative action by returning back to the shoot-and-scoot tactic behind cover. The Hellcat's speed can also be used to rush towards the point. Though not recommended due to exposing the Hellcat's to enemy fire, the speed can ensure the Hellcat will be the first on the point, with a 90 mm gun to defend itself. If lucky, the enemy team is too slow and the Hellcat will capture the point. If unlucky, the enemy will swarm the point, outnumber and constrict the Hellcat and destroy it. Thus it is not recommended to play as a point-capturer.

With good shots, the cheeks of a [[Tiger II (P)]] can be hit. Penetrating the Panther series (up to the [[Panther II]]) will require a clean shot to the mantlet and for the Panther II, a hit the flat of the turret. Same principles apply on Soviet mediums like the [[T-44]], hit the cheeks and turret ring. For Soviet heavy tanks, hit the lower glacis or the turret cheeks. Using the standard AP shot as a primary round isn't recommended as the fragmentation is minimal, same goes for APCR, which should be used only on the toughest enemies. Despite that, AP is useful against some enemies like the [[Tiger II (H)]] as the regular APCBC can penetrate the flat sides of the turret front. Use AP if there is a clean shot on the flat part of Tiger II (H) turret as it cant be penetrated by APCBC but if the turret is angled even a little AP well bounce so then use APCR same on Soviet heavy tanks. Little hint when using AP or APCR on German/Soviet heavy tanks aim for the right side to hit the gunner and commander, giving precious seconds to escape. AP and APCR isn't recommended to shoot the angled front plates of the German Panther and Tiger II's as the angle is steep enough to absorb the shot unless at point-blank range. The reload with a max reloading skill is 9.5 seconds which gives it a decent rate of fire.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fantastic 90 mm gun with a very lethal M82 APCBC round
* Pintle .50 cal machine gun is effective for anti-air purposes
* High mobility

'''Cons:'''

* Despite being on the same chassis as the regular hellcat, the super hellcat has, for some reason, very slow acceleration
* Open-topped vehicle with paper-thin armour, vulnerable to overpressure
* Exposed crew, watch out for machine gun and artillery
* A penetrating round, even if inflicting minimum crew damages, has a high chance of disabling the transmission or engine
* Ammunition always stored in hull sides

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
===Development===
During World War II, the [[M18 GMC|M18 "Hellcat"]] tank destroyer was very effective in its role in American service. Despite that, an attempt to upgrade the vehicle with a better gun took effect around 1944. Instead of the 76 mm gun that it originally had, it would take the 90 mm gun that was going into service at the time.

The attempt to construct this focused on the turret to mount the heavier and larger gun. The M18's turret was then replaced with the turret from the [[M36 GMC|M36 GMC]] to mount the 90 mm gun. Tests with this variant showed that the installation of the new turret did not hinder the speed performance of the M18, but the recoil of the 90 mm gun would cause the tank to bounce back heavily when fired, going back by at least 2 feet even with the muzzle brake attached on the 90 mm gun. The recoil force would also shake the entire tank hull and crew inside. The modified M18 mounting the 90 mm gun was nicknamed the '''"Super Hellcat"'''

===Testing and cancellation===
Despite the drawbacks, it was deemed an acceptable vehicle to use on the battlefield. The 90 mm gun would provide a very large firepower advantage over the 76 mm gun the M18 had originally, which could not penetrate the front of the [[Panther G|Panther tank]] unless in close range with HVAP ammo. The 90 mm could take out most of the late war German tank designs with ease. However, the war ended before the "Super Hellcat" could be deployed for combat use, and the project was cancelled along with the disbanding of the tank destroyer doctrine.

An experimental version of the M18 antitank vehicle armed with a 90 mm M3 cannon. Only one model was ever built. The impetus for the creation of this model was that 76mm guns had been shown to be ineffective against German heavy tanks on the Western Front. The re-equipping project was carried out on the Aberdeen training ground, which is where the vehicle's gun was also fired. Based on the results, the gun was equipped with a massive muzzle break.
