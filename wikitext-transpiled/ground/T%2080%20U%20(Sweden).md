== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a squadron rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

A contender in Swedish trials for a possible adoption of new tank in the 1990s, the T 80 U is not too dissimilar from the Soviet [[T-80U]]. The most significant difference of the T 80 U from the T-80U in the game is the lack of ''3BM46'' APFSDS round for the cannon. While the T 80 U lacks the most powerful kinetic round, it still has the same armour and mobility performances for players used to the T-80U playstyle to quickly acclimate to.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

'''Notes''':

* The {{PAGENAME}} uses two-piece ammunition, composed of projectiles (yellow) and propellant bags (orange). Both have separate racks.
* Projectiles and charges are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* The T 80 U's first stage ammo rack consists of a mechanized carousel at the bottom of the turret which carries 28 propellants and 28 projectiles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->


'''Pros:'''

* Ability to use ATGM 
* Thermal and laser telemetry
* Effective armour at its BR, protected by ERA blocking explosive munitions or some type of APFSDS. 
* Effective acceleration in muddy terrains.

'''Cons'''

* Does not have the projectile APFSDS 3BM46 available like the Russians.
* Reverse gear is very slow only 11 km/h
* Very sluggish vertical cannon aiming
* Frontal armour on the underbody of the vehicle does not protect against APFSDS projectiles at all

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
''Family page:'' '''[[T-80 (Family)|T-80 Family]]''' 

At the end of 1993, following the de-scalation after the end of the Cold War, the Swedish army created a programme for the procurement of new MBTs, and held a competition between NATO tanks and after Russia gave 2 T-80U for trial.

The competition featured M1 Abrams from the USA, which had an old 105mm gun, Leclerc from the French and the Leopard 2 from the Germans, but later two T-80Us from Russia were loaned for both combat and technical trials in the 1993/94 semester. 

Due to the government's rapid announcement that the Leopard 2 would be acquired and placed at the disposal of mechanised brigades, the trials had to be prematurely discontinued, and the Leopard 2A5 with some Swedish modifications was chosen and entered service as Strv 122.
