== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''T-10A''' is an improved modification of the seventh variant of the IS heavy tank family. It was a Soviet heavy tank designed as a complementary counterpart to the initial T-10 variant until a more substantial upgrade could be assembled. It was developed in the early 1950s as part of the Soviet Union's efforts to modernize its armoured forces. Compared to the [[IS-3]], it had better armour protection, a more powerful engine, improved firepower, and the T-10A itself added a vertical stabilizer. The layout of the turret was also changed, making it much simpler to reload the ammunition for the main gun. Despite this, the upgrades were deemed insufficient, prompting the development of subsequent iterations, most notably the T-10B and [[T-10M]], which were considered significant improvements over the T-10A and a step in the right direction for the future of the Soviet Army.

Introduced in [[Update "New Power"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season I]], it's the earliest Soviet heavy tank to feature a simple one-plane stabilizer, which makes it much easier to fire on the move and, as a result, is better for more dynamic gameplay. However, it should be noted that the T-10A's armour is not dependable at its battle rating and struggles against high-explosive anti-tank fin-stabilised (HEATFS) and armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) rounds. Despite this, the T-10A compensates with its powerful 122 mm D-25TS tank gun, which has a considerably lower reload time than the older 122 mm D-25T tank gun found in previous Soviet IS heavy tank variants.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour protection of the hull, as it is a T-10 hull, is very good except against powerful APDS, APFSDS, HEATFS and ATGMs. In a downtier the armour will work well against the majority of vehicles, however chemical rounds such as HEAT shells and ATGMs will have no issues penetrating the hull as well as APFSDS shells. Moving to the turret, it is poorly armoured even against APDS beside the gun breech. The turret may stop APCBC and some APDS shells but should not be relied on to stop HEAT and ATGM nor APFSDS.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

In terms of mobility, the T10A lacks speed as well as agility. But it can been seen as quite fast for a heavy tank, the horsepower generated by the engine makes this a beast when moving obstacles and even dead tanks. The mass can be seen as a pro and a con. Due to heavy mass, it has more traction and will not be flipped by explosions or pushed so easily by tanks. However, the mass reduced drastically the top speed as well as the acceleration.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Even though you have thick armour, HEATFS and APDS will go right through it so be careful. The T-10A's gun is powerful but for targets such as the M-103, you will have a hard time killing due to its effective armour. Your reload time is also very long, you can expect around an 18-second reload which is way less than a IS-3 or IS-4 but still long. When taking a enemy position or cap, try bringing at least 2 allies to help and support you. Since it is a Soviet tank you have a low gun depression of -3°, so avoid positions that need gun depression like hills or rough terrain. One special feature that sets the T-10A from other heavy Soviet tanks is a stabilizer which makes a huge difference in combat, however this works only at lower speeds. You also have a 12.7 mm DShK machine gun to take out lightly- armoured targets, planes, or helicopters.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good turret armour and effective pike nose hull armour, can bounce most kinetic rounds
* Good side armour which can occasionally protect you from heavy tank shells
* Decent mobility for such a heavily armoured vehicle
* Has a powerful 122 mm gun that can knock a majority of opponents with a single shot
* Has night vision device
* Has a vertical stabiliser allowing for even more effective "shoot and scoot" tactics familiar to IS commanders
* 12.7 mm DShK coaxial and commander's weapons make short work of light vehicles, allowing conservation of main gun rounds

'''Cons:'''

* Armour is not thick enough to reliably defend against HEATFS and APDS projectiles
* Cannot angle due to flat cheeks and ammo stored directly behind
* Low power-to-weight ratio in RB
* Bad reverse speed
* Long reload time
* No NVD for gunner view
* Limited ammo reserves and clip sizes for secondary weapons means you may be reloading at inconvenient times
* Lacks access to modern projectiles like HEATFS and APFSDS, making it a headache to fight against enemy with decent sloped armour

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
{{main|T-10M#History|l1=History of the T-10M}}
The T-10A is an early variant of the T-10 heavy tank. It included a single-plane stabilizer which allowed the gun to be fired accurately while moving. It was developed in 1956, and was later succeeded by the T-10B, and finally the [[T-10M]].
