== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

This vehicle is not to be confused with the Soviet uparmoured [[T-26E]]. The T-26E in the Swedish  tree is a [[Vickers Mk.E]] with the gun mount of a [[T-26]], combining the armour and mobility of the former with the firepower of the latter.

If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
