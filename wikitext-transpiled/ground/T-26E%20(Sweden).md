== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the Winter War, Finland captured hundreds of Soviet tanks and armoured vehicles, including large amounts of T-26 tanks. While most could not be repaired, some were fitted with new parts, scavenged from other tanks and sent into battle. In fact, some tanks saw their turret replaced with that found in the [[Vickers Mk.E]] tank, while retaining the original 45 mm gun and 7.62 mm MG, some of the Vickers turret still used the 9 mm Suomi hull sub-machine gun however. The new tanks were designated T-26E, the E meaning "''englantilainen''" (English).

Introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]], this vehicle is not to be confused with the Soviet uparmoured [[T-26E]]. The T-26E in the Swedish tree is a [[Vickers Mk.E]] with the gun mount of a [[T-26]], combining the armour and mobility of the former with the firepower of the latter. The '''{{Specs|name}}''' has, as already mentioned, the turret of a Vickers Mk.E, but it still retains the original T-26's weapons, like the 45 mm cannon and the 7.62 mm DT MG. The gun is excellent, one of the best at rank I, thanks to its high velocity APHE shell that also has good penetration and enough explosive filler to kill most tanks with a single hit. However, like with all T-26s, the mobility is poor when compared to more agile tanks like the [[M3 Stuart]] and the [[BT-5]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->The armour on the T-26E will only stop rifle-calibre munitions reliably, although some machine guns like the British 7.92 mm BESA or the German 7.92 mm MG34/42 can easily punch through certain 10 mm plates. The unsloped armour plates, combined with their weak protection levels boils down to one conclusion: avoid getting shot at. However, unlike the [[T-26|Soviet T-26]], the T-26E comes with 4 crewmen, which means that shells with no explosive filler shells may not knock out the entire crew with one hit to the hull, giving you a small chance to fight back, but don't count on this too much.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The T-26E has a cruise speed that allows it to keep up with most vehicles at its BR. You will not be doing anything close to racing speeds, but the tank will get you where you need to go in due time.

{{main|20-K (45 mm)}}

Unlike the [[Vickers Mk.E]] the T-26E uses the Soviet 45 mm 20-K cannon. This gun is very forgiving to beginners, with its very fast reload speed and decent damage.

==== Ammunition ====
{{:20-K (45 mm)/Ammunition|BR-240, BR-240SP}}

The APHEBC round has a good amount of HE filler, meaning penetrating shells will do good damage, sometimes even knocking out enemies with a single shot. At much longer ranges, shells begin to lose penetration and accuracy but on most common low tier maps this is not a problem due to the smaller map sizes.

{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|DT (7.62 mm)}}

The small calibre of the DT machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help. The clip capacity of the machine gun is quite poor, as it relies on a magazine of 63 bullets instead of a belt like similar machine guns from other nations.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
It is recommended to play the T-26E in a support role, flanking the battlefield and finding a good position to support your teammates from. The 45 mm cannon has quite good characteristics with its rounds (APHEBC, APBC) being able to deal a fair amount of damage to enemy vehicles from short and long ranges. The fast reload allows for quick adjustment of aim between shots, meaning the T-26E can be a highly effective flanking vehicle if a good camping spot is found. The limited gun depression, however, will affect which positions are usable. Keeping back at long-range is certainly an effective way to avoid taking damage.

The lack of armour is something to be kept in mind, because heavy-calibre machine guns like the 12.7 mm M2HB and 13.2 mm Breda Model 31 will be able to go through your thickest plates of armour. Because of this, it is recommended to try your best to avoid enemy vehicles getting the first shot. Driving under cover is advisable to avoid being spotted.

It is also worth keeping in mind that the T-26E only has a reverse speed of -4 km/h. This is important to remember when driving into potential enemy fire. It is recommended to be aware of enemy positions and cover, as a retreat will be a lot slower than an advance.

Be aware that enemy aircraft with bombs or powerful guns can easily take out the T-26E. It is advised to stick to the treeline to avoid being spotted and attacked. The T-26E has little anti-aircraft capabilities so it is also advised to let the friendly SPAAs deal with aircraft.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

* [[Pz.II (Family)|Pz.II]] and other tanks with autocannons can shred your armour and the modules behind it. Generally, it is advised not to engage head on but if you are forced to, then make sure you get off the first shot before they start spraying.
* [[:Category:Anti-aircraft vehicles|SPAAs]] - Nearly every anti-aircraft vehicle at the tier will be able to penetrate and destroy the T-26E with ease. Not to mention that SPAAs guns have high rates of fire. As with any other vehicles, it is advised to shoot first. Certain SPAAs which are commonly underestimated like the French [[P.7.T AA]], and [[CCKW 353 AA]] and the American [[M15 CGMC]], and should be especially noted, as despite not having 20 mm autocannons like their Axis counterparts, they all have weapons capable of efficiently knocking out a T-26E.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Great firepower; the APHEBC shell can frontally penetrate and take out almost any tank with a single shot
* Very short reload time
* Fairly accurate gun at short to medium ranges

'''Cons:'''

* Poor protection, side armour can be penetrated even by light machine guns
* Slow reverse speed
* Average -6° gun depression limits its potential in hilly terrains
