== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]]. This production T-28, unlike its following variants ([[T-28]] and [[T-28E]]), is equipped with a KT-28 howitzer and is primarily used as an infantry support tank. It won't be the spearhead of an armoured assault but will suffice in close quarters combat.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
As for most early war tanks, the armour isn't much to write home about. Most if not all other cannons will punch through the thickest armour of 30 mm or put a shell through the thin 20 mm sides. The only reason this tank will survive longer than other early war tanks is the amount of crew sitting around, especially the MG turret crew.

[[File:T-28 Production (2).jpg|thumb|T-28 maintaining speed on the road]]

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=775|rbMinHp=442}}

Like all the others T-28, the T-28 (1938) has relatively good mobility, with good acceleration and a top speed of 40 km/h (44 in arcade). Its 500 horsepower engine (954 in Arcade) will allow it to exploit holes in the enemy lines.
{{Break}}

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}
Best way to go through the modification is by starting with FPE and Parts and then go along the line with increasing the Firepower modules increasing the Turret slew rating and increase the gun accuracy, after that would most likely best to advance down the Engine modules to increase the acceleration and HP on the T-28 (1938) engine. Then can finish up the rest of the modules with Artillery Support and Crew Replenishment.

[[File:T-28 Production (4).jpg|thumb|T-28 pushing forwards through foliage]]
The T-28 (1938) is armed with a KT-28 howitzer, the same gun as the T-35 and the T-26-4. As a howitzer, the trajectory of the shell will compel you to get closer if you want to hit. The APHEBC shell is filled with 155 g of TNT, making sure all penetrated vehicles are knocked out after a single shot. The penetration is rather poor but is not a big problem at this BR, as almost all the vehicles you'll face won't have enough armour. The only real curve of using this gun is the velocity which is at max 387 m/s for HE & 370 m/s for the APHEBC.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|DT (7.62 mm)}}

The MGs are purely mounted for infantry combat, they won't penetrate anything that is more than covered and would only suffice at knocking out open crewed vehicles and anti-air. The vertical guidance is mediocre and you might be able to shoot down planes directly in front of the tank if you get it on a slope.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

For the size of the T-28 (1938), it has quite the mobility and its gun is quite powerful for its BR, though it lacks in penetration against the more armoured vehicles. The T-28 (1938) is a great brawler and thrives in a close combat setting. Unlike the succeeding versions, the {{PAGENAME}} can't shoot enemy tanks at a middle to long range, so avoid sniping and try to get as close as possible to the enemies. Don't travel in the open, the armour won't last long to enemy fire. But even if the armour is not adequate to endure a lot of enemy guns, it's still adequate enough to be a pain to face the enemy with its large sized crew.

T-28 (1938) has a couple of vehicles it should beware of and try to avoid in a direct confrontation, for example : [[Marder III]], [[Ho-Ni III]], [[LVT(A)(4) (ZiS-2) (China)]], [[M3 Lee]] and [[Chi-Ha Kai]]. These vehicles can easily knock out the T-28 (1938) before it comes into range to get a secure hit with the [[KT-28 (76 mm)]]. But even if the T-28 (1938) comes within range, it will have quite the trouble doing something against a [[M3 Lee]]'s armour. Which makes it crucial to be in a close quarter battle with most of these vehicles where the T-28 (1938)'s KT-28 gun will do adequate damage.

Having a large crew got its advantage with being able to replace vital crew members and will give better chance to survive auto-cannons from vehicles such as the [[Pz.II]], [[Ta-Se]] and [[M15 CGMC]] where the large and spread out crew can be a life saver. Large crew can also be a blessing against small cannon fire from 37 mm or 45 mm, but can still be easily decimated by larger guns like 75 mm, 120 mm or 150 mm which can cause devastating blow to the T-28 (1938).

So in summary, the best way to utilize the vehicle is by close quarter combat against most vehicles. Within a safe range of the KT-28 gun where it can hopefully penetrate enemy vehicles or if the 76 mm shells HE filling will eliminate the vehicle. The mobility can work well in a close combat where if T-28 keeps moving will be hard to hit where the enemy want to hit to destroy. T-28 large crew will also make it able to take a few hit depending on the gun being used against it.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Numerous crew members grant a longer survivability
* Good mobility
* Armour-piercing shells filled with a large explosive will allow you to take out most tanks with a single shot
* Shrapnel shells are useful to destroy trucks and armoured cars

'''Cons:'''

* Big silhouette and profile, difficult to hide
* Poorly armoured vehicle
* Low muzzle velocity makes long distance targeting difficult

{{Notice
 |The T-28 (1938) represents the T-28 Model 1936.}}

'''Development'''

The T-28 Model 1934 (first production T-28 variant) was modified with steel wheels for the number four and five suspension bogies starting in 1936. They were also modified with a new turret roof that had two hatches; it is not known if these modifications were applied at the same time or separately. The commander's hatch on the left side received a P-40 anti-aircraft machine gun mount. Additionally, the 71-TK-1 radio set was replaced by the improved 71-TK-3. The engine air intakes were later changed as well, either in 1936 or 1937. T-28s with these changes were called the T-28 Model 1936 for obvious reasons. Other than the above stated changes they were identical to T-28 Model 1934 tanks.<ref name=":0">https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/457963-t-28-model-1936-marginally-better/</ref>

'''Design'''

The T-28 Model 1936 had a three-turret design, with a central three-man turret and two smaller one-man auxiliary machine gun turrets located in front and to each side of the main turret. The crew complement was six with a driver in the hull front, a gunner in each auxiliary turret, and a gunner, loader, and commander in the main turret. The engine and transmission were located at the rear of the hull with fuel tanks on each side of it. The weight is stated to be around 25 tonnes but that number depends on the source. A 71-TK-3 radio set was provided which was a feature not all too common at the time.

The primary armament was a 76.2 mm KT-28 howitzer located in the main turret alongside a coaxial 7.62 mm DT machine gun. The main gun could elevate 25° and depress 5° and the main turret could traverse a full 360°. Each auxiliary turret was armed with a single 7.62 mm DT machine gun. Finally, a 7.62 mm DT machine gun could be mounted on the commander's cupola for a total of four 7.62 mm machine guns. The ammunition load was 70 76.2 mm rounds and 7,938 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition (2,646 rounds per three standard machine guns, not including optional anti-aircraft machine gun).

The engine used was a 48 liter, 500 horsepower V12 M-17T aircraft engine. This powerful engine allowed a speed of around 40-45 km/h to be reached, with the number depending on the source. The downside of the engine was that the high-octane gasoline fuel was incredibly volatile when hit by enemy fire. The transmission had four forward gears and one reverse gear.

The suspension consisted of 12 steel road wheels, all rubber rimmed except for the two pairs on the fourth and fifth bogies. The drive sprocket was at the rear and the idler wheel was at the front of the suspension. There were four return rollers. Note: all of these numbers are for each side meaning the total amount of the components would be double the numbers listed. The tracks were 45 cm (17.7 inches) wide - relatively thin for the size of the vehicle.

The armour protection was relatively thin for such a large tank with a maximum thickness of 30 mm on the front and 20 mm on the sides and rear. The sides of the hull, though, were also protected by side skirts.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/soviet/soviet_T-28.php</ref>

'''Production and Service'''

Around 500-600 (depending on the source) total T-28 medium tanks of all variants were built from 1933 to 1941, when the T-34 superseded it on production lines.

The Soviet heavy armoured brigades consisted of 136 T-28 and 37 BT tanks in 1939. T-28s were often used more on the Sino-Mongolian border against the Japanese Imperial Army but were also used in European actions. Notable actions in the east included the Nomonhan incident and border classes of 1938 through late 1939. The first combat use of the T-28 in Europe was against Poland during the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.

The T-28 was used very heavily during the Winter War of 1939-1940 which was a Soviet invasion of Finland. The T-28s were used in the assault against the heavily fortified Mannerheim line. During the conflict around 200 T-28s were knocked out by Finnish anti-tank guns, artillery, or ambushes. Oftentimes the knocked out T-28s were recovered in working condition and were reused after some repairs, up to five times during the conflict. A total of seven T-28s were captured by Finnish forces and used against the Soviet Red Army, nicknamed "ostivaunu" which means "wagon coaches". During the war it quickly became apparent to the Red Army that the T-28 did not have sufficient armour and so the T-28E up-armoured version was produced and earlier models were modified in the field with the increased armour. It was these vehicles that finally broke through the Mannerheim line in 1940 and forced the Finns to sue for peace.

Even by June 1941 there remained 411 T-28s on the Western front, as reported by official numbers. That same month the German Operation Barbarossa - the invasion of the USSR - began and most of the T-28 tanks were knocked out in just the first two months of combat. Not all of them were knocked out by enemy tanks, many broke down due to lack of spare parts and poor maintenance. At least one was captured by the Germans - designated T-28 746(r) - and also at least one by the Hungarians. The last running T-28s were used in the defense of Moscow and Leningrad but were removed from frontline service by 1942 due to them having become obsolete by that time. They were then only used for training and parts.

Turkey apparently received two T-28s and used them in the 1st Tank Regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Division based at Luleburgaz.<ref name=":1" />

'''Surviving Vehicles'''

A few T-28 tanks survive to this day including two at the museum in Parola, Finland and one in Moscow, Russia which happens to be the only remaining T-28 Model 1936 left in the world.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
