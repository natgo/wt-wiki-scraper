== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

This T-28 represents those captured by Finland during the Winter War and WWII. It is identical in performance to the Soviet [[T-28]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Despite being a medium tank, the T-28 is somewhat lightly armoured for its BR. Its crew is also closely packed and surrounded by multiple ammo racks that are prone to detonation if hit, this leads to it having somewhat weak survivability, however angling the vehicle will increase the effectiveness of the armour and aid in your survivability. The T-28 has a high crew count of 6, which can aid its survivability somewhat.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|L-10 (76 mm)}}

The main armament of the T-28 is the 76 mm L-10 cannon, a rifled gun that can fire 3 types of ammunition: HE (OF-350M), APHEBC (BR-350A), and Shrapnel (Sh-354T). The most common shell for anti-tank use would be the APHEBC, however the Shrapnel and HE can be used against lightly or unarmoured vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The powerful, yet accurate gun, paired with thin armour and a large profile makes the T-28 look ideal for long-range encounters, yet its low penetration, slow shell velocity and no real gun depression to exploit terrain discourages this kind of gameplay. However, due to the crew/equipment spacing that helps soak damage and keep it fighting, its highly versatile and powerful main gun make this tank quite capable in close range encounters.

If against a larger or more powerful tank, the T-28 will often be forced to stay and fight, as the large profile of the tank makes it easy to hit while retreating. Use the gun's accuracy to an advantage. Aim for weak points like the driver's hatch or gunner's port. If unable to shoot against such a small target, attempt to cripple the tank's offensive armament to take some pressure off.

Avoid T-34s, especially the later modifications. Their APHE ammo is devastatingly explosive, especially against such a large easy-to-hit tank with no real armour like the T-28. One shot almost anywhere into the tank and that's the end. At the same time, the T-34's own armour is basically invulnerable to the T-28 shells, except when on their sides, where the 76 mm can penetrate the turret, and possibly the side hull armour (Only with AP ammo). Keep in mind that T-34s can turn both their hull and turret very fast, so if the first shot misses, there won't be another chance.

Light tanks that can flank around the side or back of the T-28 can prove catastrophic as well.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The cannon is accurate and is able to do large amounts of damage on penetration
* Crew of six
* Fast and versatile for such a big medium tank
* Machine gun turrets and complicated multi-layer side armour often absorb projectiles
* Total of 3 machine guns can make short work of any unarmoured AA vehicles

'''Cons:'''

* Large silhouette
* Generally thin armour
* Slow reload time
* Poor gun depression
* Bad penetration with all types of ammo
* Lacklustre shrapnel shell as stock ammo

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The T-28 was the first medium tank the Soviets ever manufactured, it was intended to be used as a heavily armoured tank to support infantry and break through enemy defenses. During the Winter War, the Soviets found out the hard way that the T-28 had inadequate armour and due to this (and poor tactics) the T-28 tanks took heavy losses with an estimate of 200 T-28 tanks lost during the Winter War. Of the T-28's operating in the Winter War the Finnish managed to capture 7, all of which were integrated to the Finnish army and saw combat later in the Continuation War. The Finnish nicknamed the T-28 "postivaunu" (postal wagon) after a captured T-28 was found to be carrying the mail and salaries of Soviet soldiers.
