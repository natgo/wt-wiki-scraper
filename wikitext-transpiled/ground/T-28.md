== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before Update 1.41. An unorthodox medium tank with three turrets, it is quite mobile and armed with a 76 mm gun to defend itself against its contemporaries. It may look big, but the T-28 is surprisingly agile and the roomy inside will turn many small calibre APHE shells into hot-air.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
[[File:T-28 Screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|T-28 driving over Ice on "[[Finland]]"]]

Despite being a medium tank the T-28 is somewhat lightly armoured for its BR, alongside than the crew is closely packed and surrounded by ammo racks that will be prone to detonation if hit, this leads to it having somewhat weak survivability, however angling the vehicle will increase the effectiveness of the armour and aid in your survivability.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=775|rbMinHp=442}}

Despite its fair weight the T-28 has decent mobility, the vehicle can easily move around the map to capture points or to attack enemy positions, the vehicle weighs 25.4 tons with an engine producing 500 hp giving the T-28 19.6 hp per ton.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

# '''Parts''' - Mandatory first upgrade, then whatever else.
# '''BR-350A Ammo!''' - Without it, the T-28 won't be able to defeat the armour of half the tanks it'll meet
# '''Adjustment of Fire''' AND '''Fire Extinguisher''' - to improve accuracy, or have the ability to put out fires
# '''Anything else''', but upgrades that improve mobility are advised

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|L-10 (76 mm)}}

The Main armament of the T-28 is the [[L-10 (76 mm)|76mm L-10]] cannon, this is a rifled gun that can fire 3 types of ammunition: High explosive (HE)(OF-350M), Armour-Piercing High Explosive Ballistic Capped (APHEBC)(BR-350A) & a Shrapnel round (Sh-354T), The most common anti tank would be the APHEBC, however the Shrapnel and HE can be used against lightly or unarmoured vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The powerful, yet accurate gun, paired with thin armour and a large profile makes the T-28 look ideal for long-range encounters, yet its low penetration, slow shell velocity and no real gun depression to exploit terrain discourages this kind of gameplay. However, due to the crew/equipment spacing that helps soak damage and keep it fighting, its highly versatile and powerful main gun make this tank quite capable in close range encounters. Hit & run tactics work pretty well (if the "run" aspect of it is ever needed).

If against a larger or more powerful tank, the T-28 will often be forced to stay and fight, as the large profile of the tank makes it easy to hit while retreating. Use the gun's accuracy to an advantage. Aim for weak points like the driver's hatch or gunner's port. If unable to shoot against such a small target, attempt to cripple the tank's offensive armament to take some pressure off.

Avoid T-34s, especially the later modifications. Their APHE ammo is devastatingly explosive, especially against such a large easy-to-hit tank with no real armour like the T-28. One shot almost anywhere into the tank and that's the end. At the same time, the T-34's own armour is basically invulnerable to the T-28 shells, except when on their sides, where the 76 mm can penetrate the turret, and possibly the side hull armour (Only with AP ammo). Keep in mind that T-34s can turn both their hull and turret very fast, so if the first shot misses, there won't be another chance.

Light tanks that can flank around the side or back of the T-28 can prove catastrophic as well.

=== Pros and cons ===

* Total of 3 machine guns can make short work of any unarmoured AA vehicles

'''Cons:'''

* Large silhouette
* Generally thin armour
* Slow reload time
* Poor gun depression
* Bad penetration with all types of ammo
* Stock ammo types can't penetrate heavy tanks

===Development===
Prerequisites set up in 1929 called for infantry support and breakthrough tank that are able to exploit breakthroughs and handle infantry fortifications. The development of this tank under Chief engineer S.Ginsburg may have been inspired by the British Vickers A1E1 Independent tank as the final design took some elements of it. The end result was a multi-turreted medium tank with a 76.2 mm L-10 main gun and two 7.62 mm machine gun turrets in front. The design was satisfactory that Stalin himself ordered a heavier variant of the tank that can suit the breakthrough role, which would be the [[T-35]]. The first multi-turreted was designated the '''T-28''' and was considered revolutionary for the time as it was the first medium tank of its kind and would establish the concept of such tanks. The first prototype of the T-28 was created sometime in 1931, its design was considered revolutionary for the time as it was one of the first medium tanks in the world. Production of this tank began in the Kirov Factory in Leningrad sometime in 1932, and it was accepted into service on August 11, 1933. Though in service for eight years from 1933 to 1941, only 503 units were produced.

===Design===
The T-28 was relatively slow for its weight at 28 tons, but as an infantry tank, this disadvantage was mitigated by its role and its heavier armour. The front two turrets with machine guns are installed in front of the main turret, which was considerably higher. The main turret was a shared feature from the T-35 in order to standardize parts in production. The tank was initially to be armed with a 45 mm gun like the [[BT-7|BT]] and [[T-26]] light tanks, but the larger 76.2 mm howitzer was chosen instead for added explosive power. The turret had a turret basket and a rear-facing machine gun. A later upgrade had a commander's cupola added onto the turret plus the capability to mount another machine gun on top for anti-aircraft purposes. The tank had a crew of six (driver, two machine gunners, loader, gunner, commander) and ran on a V12 M17 air-cooled engine that can deliver 500 horsepower. Though providing enough power to propel the T-28 at a speed of about 37 km/h (22 mph), the gasoline fuel it used was flammable and rare in Soviet usage. The armour on the tank was 30 mm maximum on the front and side glacis, which was sufficient enough to stop most anti-tank armament at the time. The suspension on the tank was a bogie system with plunger springs and usually has a 20 mm thick side skirt protecting the sides. Transmission and engine compartment is at the very rear under a canopy for easy access. At its introduction in 1933, the T-28 was one of the most effective tanks in the world and had a few innovations. Other countries only had WWI-era Renaults and the Germans had no tanks of their own at its development. The T-28 was also the first to have radios and anti-aircraft gun mounts.

===Combat usage===
The standard organization of the T-28 tanks in 1939 was 136 T-28s and 47 [[BT-7]] in one heavy armoured brigade. The T-28s were first deployed on the eastern borders during the border clashes with Japan in 1939. The first large scale action was in September 1939 when the Soviet Union invades Poland with its front line fleet of T-28s. Though the Polish tanks and anti-tank guns were able to take out a few T-28s, it is not known how many were lost. The next conflict the T-28 served in was the Winter War against Finland. These tanks were used against Finnish fortifications, but the conflict also showed the inadequate armour on the T-28, where Finnish anti-tank guns were able to reliably penetrate the tanks. Though over 200 T-28s were knocked out in the conflict, only 20 were totally lost due to the system of armour recovery and repairs the Soviet had and the conflict's close proximity to the Kirov Factory, some tanks were repaired more than five times and sent back to the front. The Finnish were able to capture seven of these (two in the Winter War, 5 in Continuation War)and used them against their users. The Finnish came about to nicknaming them ''Postivaunu'' ("mail coach") after an incident where a T-28 commander was captured carrying the salary and mail for the 91st Tank Battalion and ''Kivitalo'' ("stone building") for its large size. The heavy weight of the tank caused the Finnish to be unable to tow some of the knocked out T-28s for capture, so those unable to be recovered were stripped of their equipment.

After Finland, the T-28's inadequate armour was showcased to the Soviets and an attempt at up-armouring the design was made in 1940 with the welding of additional armour plating to increase the 30 mm armour to 80 mm of armour in thickness. This increase in armour made the tank now weigh 32 tons. This up armouring of the tank was designated the '''[[T-28E]]'''.

During the German invasion in Operation Barbarossa in mid-1941, the Soviets had about 411 T-28s in their inventory. Many were lost not due to battle, but actually from mechanical breakdowns due to lack of spare parts and low maintenance, causing them to be abandoned by the crew. The Germans were able to capture at least two of these tanks and may have used these against the Soviets as the ''T-28 746(r)''. The T-28s that were not lost during the first few months of Operation Barbarossa took part in winter defence of Leningrad and Moscow. Though still in inventory, by 1942 they were rare in Soviet service and declared obsolete as better tanks like the [[T-34 (1941)|T-34]] was taking over its role and is more heavily gunned, more armoured, and faster. The tanks still in one piece were dismantled for spare parts or sent to training facilities.

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
The T-28 was put into service in the Red Army in August 1933 and produced by the Leningrad Kirovsk factory right up until 1940. Over 550 of them were built in total.

A main feature of the tank was its three armed rotating turrets. The main turret in the middle of the tank was equipped with a 76.2 mm KT-28 cannon and two DT machine guns. The turret could turn 360° and was equipped with electric drive. Two smaller turrets armed with machine guns were located in front of the main turret. Each of these turrets could fire across a 220° arc. Starting from 1938, the tank began to be equipped with a 76 mm L-10 cannon.

Combat experience with the tank in the war with Finland led to its armour being strengthened by laying additional armour plates on its base armour and to manufacturing the vehicle with conical turrets, providing better protection against the enemy's weapons. Some late production vehicles were equipped with a DT anti-aircraft machine gun.

In spite of its relatively large mass at 27.8 tonnes, the tank had good mobility due to its reduced ground pressure. Its small-diameter road wheels were covered by add-on armour plates.

With all its primary combat characteristics put together, the T-28 was the strongest medium tank in the world in the 1930s. At the beginning of its production, it had practically no equal among mass-produced tanks. At the same time, the tank was a very complex vehicle with an outdated armament layout. It had serious flaws in its engine and transmission system. The undercarriage wore out rapidly: the springs snapped, parts of the suspension failed, and the hub drive cogs broke.

Vehicles of this type were used in combat operations at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. The tanks were used in separate battle units on the Leningrad front until 1943.

A Finnish tank brigade captured and operated 7 of these tanks right up until 1945.
