The '''T-34 (1942)''' is the third variant of the [[T-34 (Family)|T-34 medium tank family]]. Since the T-34's standardized manufacturing machine tools were not easily available, modifications were rarely introduced into the production process. Despite the protests of the crews and commanders, several elements of the T-34 remained unmodified until 1942. For the T-34 (1942) variant, the main changes were to make the manufacturing process streamlined and the parts became less expensive. For example, the regularly used F-34 76.2 mm tank gun was streamlined to the point that approximately 200 parts (from 861 to 614) were no longer required. Even though numerous gun mounts were tested, the gun sights and range finder remained primitive. The crews were unable to use their guns at long range, as the Germans frequently did. This resulted in aggressive tactics focused on frequent mobility, whereas German tanks could remain still and fire at approaching targets from a safe distance. Due to a paucity of rubber, regular rubberized wheels were not utilized, and many bare-metal wheels of various designs were employed. This is frequently observed in photographs (and reflected in-game) as a bizarre blend of road wheels. Early in 1942, a new, considerably improved hexagonal turret was introduced as an outcome of the abandoned T-34M project, which was an important improvement over the previous [[T-34 (1941)|T-34 (1941) variant]]. Notably, the large hatch was replaced by separate hatches (called "Mickey Mouse" by the Germans because of how it appeared from the front with the hatches open).

Introduced in the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before Update 1.41, the T-34 (1942) improved crew ergonomics and dependability, although this is largely due to mechanical component simplification rather than a primary objective of crew comfort. In general, the T-34 (1942) variant is quite similar to the previous T-34 (1941) variant in capabilities and attributes, but with a somewhat faster reload speed and a thicker driver's hatch cover. It also has late-war armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR) ammunition at its disposal. However, as adversaries begin to gain more powerful armaments, resulting in much tougher enemies in battle, players may begin to find the hull frontal armour plate inadequate in protection.

|-
|}
'''Notes:'''

* Suspensions wheels and tracks are 20 mm thick.

==== Hull armour ====
The 1942 model has a very similar hull armour profile to the 1941 model, relying on angling instead of sheer thickness for protection. There are two key differences: the machine gun ball mount has an increased thickness of 60 mm of armour (compared to 45 mm on earlier models), as does the driver's hatch (75 mm, compared to 45 mm on earlier models). The weakspots created by the driver's optics on earlier models have also been removed. The driver's hatch has the thickest armour on any part of the T-34 and can be quite resilient to enemy fire if hit.

It should be noted that due to the relatively thin plate thickness used (40–45 mm), the T-34's hull can be vulnerable to overmatching from 75 mm and larger guns.

==== Turret armour ====
The new hexagonal turret features thicker armour than on the 1941 model. However, there are a few caveats:

* The angling is noticeably worse, and there are some relatively flat spots on the front that can be vulnerable to penetrations from even relatively weak guns at close ranges.
* The turret front, side, and rear armour is made of cast armour instead of rolled plate, which is slightly weaker.
* Turret ring appears to be larger than previous versions.

Overall, the turret armour is not a significant improvement over the earlier models and is in some ways weaker.

==== Module/crew layout ====
The bulk of the T-34's main gun ammunition is carried low in the hull, making it relatively hard to detonate the ammunition of a T-34, especially if it is carrying a reduced ammunition load. However, the T-34's hull sides are spanned by relatively large fuel tanks; thus, side penetrations can cause the diesel fuel to catch fire. These tanks can also detonate when hit on rare occasions, instantly destroying the tank.

The crew are seated in a quite compact manner inside the tank, and successful penetrations are likely to disable multiple crew members at once.

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=775|rbMinHp=442|AoAweight=0.25}}

The {{PAGENAME}} has a relatively good power-to-weight ratio. Combined with the wide tracks, this gives it excellent mobility, even over relatively soft terrain. It is slightly heavier than the earlier T-34 models, although its mobility is not noticeably different.

The {{PAGENAME}} is not capable of neutral steering and has a reverse speed of about -10 km/h.

The 76 mm F-34 cannon remains the main armament of the 1942 model. It has a wide selection of ammunition, a relatively fast rate of fire, and is reasonably accurate.
The hexagonal turret has a very fast rotation speed, complimenting the T-34's advantages in brawling, close-range combat and allowing it to respond quickly to threats from multiple directions. The 5° of gun depression is standard for most Soviet tanks, although bad compared to most Allied tanks.

==== Ammunition ====
The available ammunition allows for engaging all types of targets:

* '''BR-350A (MD-5 fuze)''': APHEBC; a shell with high explosive mass that will knock any tank with a single shot but has an average penetration power.
* '''BR-350B (MD-8 fuze)''': APHEBC; increased penetration at the cost of slightly less explosive filler.
* '''BR-350SP''': APBC; a solid shot with an even better penetration but no explosive filler.
* '''BR-354P''': APCR; a composite round with the best penetration but no explosive filler and will only penetrate flat vertical surfaces.
* '''BP-353A''': HEAT; a shaped charge with average penetration but without penetration loss over distance. Only penetrates flat vertical surfaces but the post-penetration damage is very effective on open and lightly armoured vehicles. Very slow shell travelling twice slower than your other projectiles.
* '''OF-350M''': HE; useful for destroying open and lightly armoured vehicles.
* '''Sh-354T''': Shrapnel; useful against vehicles that are resistant to the HE shells but too thinly armoured to trigger the fuses of AP shells.
* '''D-350A''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives.

Like the previous T-34 models, the 1942 model excels at close to medium range fighting, utilizing its outstanding mobility for a medium tank to rapidly close the distance and relocate to attack from unexpected directions. The sloped hull armour has a good chance of ricocheting hastily aimed shots and helps increase the odds of the T-34 surviving when moving in to engage. The lethal BR-350B APHEBC round complements this playstyle, having about enough penetration to deal with the flanks of most enemies likely to be encountered; a single penetrating hit is usually fatal for the target. In close combat, the fast turret traverses and quick reload allow the T-34 to respond quickly towards changing situations, usually helping to ensure it will be the first to get its gun on the target.

Conversely, the T-34 fares poorly in long-range combat; both the BR-350B APHEBC and BR-354P APCR rounds have poor penetration at long ranges, and the BP-353A HEAT round is quite underwhelming as well.

=== Common opponents ===

* [[M4]], [[M4A2]] - The T-34's 76 mm gun cannot penetrate the welded hull M4/M4A2 reliably from the front, while the 75 mm gun on the M4/M4A2 can penetrate the T-34's turret and disable or cripple it. They do have very weak lower side hull armour (only 38 mm) that can be overmatched by the 76 mm APHEBC round if exposed, and the flat areas on the turret can also be penetrated fairly reliably if they can be hit. Generally avoid head-on engagements, especially if the M4 is hull-down.

* [[M4A1]], [[Sherman II]] - Similar to the M4/M4A2, except that the cast hull is weaker than the welded hull on the M4/M4A2, and can be penetrated frontally. Otherwise, the same advice applies.

* [[Pz.IV F2]], [[Pz.IV G|G]], [[Pz.IV H|H]], [[Pz.IV J|J]] - The Ausf. F2 variant is the first Panzer IV to mount a long-barreled 75 mm gun. This gun is one of the most lethal mounted on any tank within the T-34's BR range, and it is easily capable of penetrating the T-34 at most ranges. The Ausf. F2 has very weak armour, however, and is something of a glass cannon. The Ausf. G, H, and J have up-armoured hulls that are quite difficult to penetrate, but their turrets are as weak as the one on the F2. The Ausf. J, in particular, has manual turret traverse and is very vulnerable to being flanked. Avoid long-range duels with them.

* [[Chi-Nu II]] - Essentially the Japanese counterpart to the German Panzer IV Ausf. F2.

* [[Churchill III]], [[Pz.Kpfw. Churchill (Germany)]] - The 6-pounder gun on the Churchill will be hard-pressed to penetrate the sloped T-34 hull, but it can easily penetrate the turret and disable the turret crew. It is difficult to penetrate the frontal armour of the Churchill at long ranges. However, it is a slow, cumbersome heavy tank, and is easy to outflank and dispatch with shots to the side armour.

* [[Churchill VII]] - The Churchill VII is virtually immune to the T-34 from the front, while its 75 mm gun can penetrate the T-34's turret fairly easily. Even from the side, it has 95 mm of armour that cannot be penetrated by the BR-350B APHEBC round except at very close range, and even slight angling will render it all but immune. It is even slower than the Churchill III, however, and thus easy to avoid and outflank.

'''Pros:'''

* Fast turret traverse and quick reload, excelling in close combat situations
* Sloped hull armour resists well against lower calibre guns (e.g. 75 mm M3, 50 mm KwK39), capable of ricocheting larger calibre guns when angled correctly
* Excellent post-penetration effect with the BR-350B, easily knocking most tanks with a single shot
* Excellent manoeuvrability and high speed for a medium tank, allowing for quick relocation and flanking attacks
* Access to BR-354P APCR round for use against heavily armoured targets (e.g. [[StuG III G]] with add-on tracks) at close range
* Well-protected ammunition stowage in the hull floor

'''Cons:'''

* Hull armour is vulnerable to overmatching by large-calibre guns like the [[Dicker Max]]
* Hexagonal turret has a thicker but less angled armour and is also a larger target compared to the original T-34 turret
* Poor penetration at long range with any ammunition type making it inferior in large maps like Kursk
* Cramped interior, penetrations are likely to cripple multiple modules and/or crew members. Can easily get knocked out by common enemies with a single shot
* -5 degrees gun depression is below average, making it ineffective to combat in hills comparing to the [[M4]] with -10 degrees depression
* Awkward to place bushes on upper front hull due to the obstruction of MG port and driver's optics

===Development===
By 1939, the most numerous tank models in the Red Army were the [[T-26|T-26]] and the [[BT-7|BT-series]] light tanks. Though adequate on the days they were introduced, they are now outdated by this time due to the changing technology in anti-tank warfare. Back in 1937, a new tank project was already taking place under engineer Mikhail Koshkin, who was assigned to lead a design team at the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory (KhPZ) for a replacement for the BT light tanks as a new "cavalry tank" to engage in manoeuvre warfare. The first prototype was designated the ''A-20'' with 20 mm of armour, a 45 mm gun, and a diesel engine in a V-12 configuration. The Christie suspension is taken from the BT, even the conversion to drive track-less on roads. But gradually, the new track designs available made this conversion redundant and was excluded in further models. The A-20 also showed the effective research done into sloping armour on previous prototype designs, utilizing an all-around sloping armour on the design.

It was during this design process that the Russo-Japanese border wars took place and showed the deficiency of the T-26 and BT models. Koshkin then appealed for the initiation of a much better tank concept, the "universal tank" to completely replace the T-26 and BT tanks. The second prototype was the ''A-32'' and has an increased 32 mm of frontal armour with a 76.2 mm L-10 gun. The heavier prototype was still just as mobile as the A-20, and further development into the design increased the frontal armour thickness to 45 mm thick and a newer 76.2 mm L-11 gun attached instead. This model was approved for production and designated the '''T-34''' after the year 1934 when Koshkin believed was when he formulated the idea for the T-34. Koshkin, however, never saw his tanks in action as he succumbed to pneumonia in September 1940 after trials with the T-34 in the cold winter. Thus, the drivetrain developer Alexander Morozov was appointed as the next Chief Designer. The T-34 tank would go on to become the most produced World War II tank, with 84,070 tanks produced in the production span between 1940 to 1958.

===Design===
The T-34 took all of the Soviet's experiences with tanks and incorporated into the design. The tank had great sloping armour, a powerful engine, wide tracks, and a large gun. At its introduction, the armour of the T-34 was one of the best in the world, by sloping the 45 mm thick armour plate by 60 degrees, the effective thickness was now 90 mm thick. The armour was welded into place instead of riveted as rivets tend to "spall" and cause damage inside the tank even if the armour was not penetrated. The 76.2 mm gun was a major advantage compared to those on its adversaries, as it could be used as a multi-purpose weapon against infantry and tanks, unlike the Germans who had tanks split for two different roles such as the [[Pz.III E|Panzer III for anti-tank]] and the [[Pz.IV F1|Panzer IV for infantry support]]. The engine, a Model V-2-34 V12 diesel engine, was adequately powerful for the Christie suspension tank design and allowed the T-34 to reach a maximum of 53 km/h (33 mph). The powerful engine, added with the wide tracks that gave it lower ground pressure, allowed the T-34 to travel across cross-country terrain with relative freedom without risk of bogging down.

However, the T-34 is not without its fault and its quality is very questionable in some cases. Two [[T-34 (1941)]] models were sent to the United States in late 1942 for evaluations. The evaluations found the armour quality to be rather insufficient, with improper welding in places that can allow leaks and improper alloys that made armour weaker in some places than others, the T-34 cast turret was even found to use softer armour than the hull that render it vulnerable to even 37 mm shells. The gun sights for the 76.2 mm cannon was also quite poor in comparison to the Axis and other Allies. The tank reliability was also troubled by various mechanical issues, especially in the earlier models. Low-quality air filters and insufficient airflow could impede the engine capabilities and the turret drive had poor reliability that could easily jam up. The vision devices were also poor, the crew are unable to see outside the tank with enough situational awareness, even the tank commander couldn't see well out of the tank. Also, the lack of radios on the first few years of T-34s forced the tank commanders to communicate via flags, with only company commanders tanks fitted with the radios. Ergonomics inside the tanks was unsatisfactory and was very cramped inside, with no turret basket the loader has to struggle when the turret rotates and accessing ammunition on the floor boxes makes it a hard and dangerous job for the loader. The commander's hatch on the turret was also one-piece, making even a "heads-up" view for the commander impossible on these large one-piece hatches. Finally, the two-person turret suffered from not only a very cramped compartment but an overworked commander who has to act as a gunner as well.

===T-34 Mod. 1942===
The '''T-34 Mod. 1942''' was an improved variant of the T-34 that also presented some fixes to general issues with the T-34. The Model 1942 was still mounted with a 76.2 mm cannon, making it a T-34/76 still, and the design featured additional armour and many simplified parts and components. The tank's road wheels, track pattern, driver's hatch, and transmission access cover on the rear were redesigned. Some of the designs also had a headlight moved to the left of the hull. However, at the same time, the '''Model 1943''' (released in 1942) was also introduced into the circulation, which features the more radical changes in the T-34 tank compared to the Mod. 1942. The T-34 Mod. 1943 was most prominent with the hexagonal turret, more armour, increased fuel capacity, and more ammo stowage. The hatches on this new turret came in two, one for loader and the commander and opens in a way that the Germans nicknamed it the "Mickey Mouse" tank due to the round hatches forming a shape similar to the circular ears when both are opened. Later Mod. 1943 production tanks were given a commander's cupola that provided a decent view for the commander, much better compared to a lone periscope, which was the only vision device for the commander when "button-upped" beforehand. To increase confusion, the Mod. 1943 was called the Model 1942 by the Soviets; regardless this vehicle is the most prominent by the hexagonal turret, which is seen in-game. Though it is unsure about the specific number of the model was produced, it made up part of the 35,120 T-34/76 created in its production life.

===Combat usage===
The newer T-34 models saw action in most operations in 1942, most notably during the Battle of Stalingrad, where T-34s made the main striking force of Operation Uranus to encircle the German Sixth Army and trap them inside Stalingrad. During the battle, T-34s were still being made in the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, churning out tanks that were immediately sent to the front-lines once finished that sometimes went without paint finish and crewed by the workers that were involved building the tank in the factory. After Stalingrad, the Soviet Army continued to push the Germans back in various of offensives, with the T-34 as the main tank in the armoured force. The T-34 mod. 1943 were also given to Polish and Czech units that escaped to the Soviet Union to continue fighting against the Germans. Like the Soviets, these units received little training with the T-34 and so casualties remain high in T-34 crew members.

The T-34 also became the most numerous tank in Soviet usage by the time Germany launched the 1943 Summer offensive Operation Citadel or the "Battle of Kursk". This battle was the debut of the [[Panther D|Panthers]] and saw a very large concentration in [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]]s and [[Ferdinand|Ferdinand tank destroyers]]. Other units supplementing these heavier tanks were the [[Pz.IV H|Panzer IVs]], [[StuG III G|StuG IIIs]], and the [[Pz.III M|Panzer III]]s. The introduction of these newer and more powerful tanks and tank destroyers and improved German tanks in the largest tank battle in history caused high casualties in the T-34 ranks and the entire Soviet armoured forces in a whole. The Tiger's 88 mm cannon is able to destroy the T-34 from a range of 1,500 m while the 76.2 mm cannon on the T-34 must get very close in order to penetrate. In order to engage these tanks, the T-34 forces try to maximize their massive quantity of units to overwhelm German tank units and getting to "point-blank" ranges to the point of ramming in order to negate either of the tank's range advantages and blast away at each other.

The T-34's growing deficiency in performance in the war was due to the Soviet high command decision's to keep with one design in production to minimize costs and keep manufacturing rate high. This meant that upgrades to the tank were not the highest priority for the tank. While this ideal was very sufficient in the first two years since Operation Barbarossa, it now made the T-34 lacking compared to the improved German tanks. Attempts to fix this decision was to mount stronger guns onto the T-34, the first attempt was the mounting of the [[T-34-57|57 mm ZiS-4 cannon]] to make the T-34 a "tank hunter", but the 57 mm gun lacked a decent HE shell, this was not an efficient tank gun and was pulled. Then, it was decided to mount an 85 mm anti-aircraft gun onto the tank, though requiring a much larger turret to take in the bigger gun. This tank with the 85 mm gun was called the [[T-34-85 (D-5T)|T-34-85]].

In 1942, a larger cast hexagonal turret was developed with two round hatches for the commander and the loader. The turret's armour was enhanced to a thickness of 52 mm in its frontal section. Its ammunition load was increased to 100 shells. Its operational range was also increased to 400 km by adding additional fuel tanks inside and outside the hull. The front-mounted 7.62 mm DT machine gun received an armoured gun mantlet. Depending on the factory that made them, the road wheels differed from each other in their appearance.

Solid drop-forged rubber-coated wheels cast with reinforcing bars and circular apertures on the disc were used, both with and without bands. The tank was equipped with a more effective air filter system and an all-range fuel pump regulator. Unit commanders' vehicles were upgraded to the more powerful 9-R radio set from the 71-ТК-3 set. The T-34's mass increase from 28.5 tonnes to 30.9. The increased weight did not affect the vehicle's speed and manoeuvrability.

The turrets, produced by the UZTM factory in 1943, were drop-forged from 45 mm plate. These turrets were easy to differentiate from others owing to their rounded upper edges. On the whole, the new changes lead to an increase in the tank's manufacturing ease, combat strength and manoeuvrability. In total, 23,332 of these tanks were manufactured with the upgraded turret.

Tanks of this model participated in all the operations of the Great Patriotic War from the end of 1942 to the Battle in Berlin. Furthermore, their proportion in tank brigades constantly grew, and by November 1943, brigades had become uniform groups of 65 T-34s. Captured tanks served in the armies of Finland, Romania, and Hungary and were actively used by the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS. The latter had an entire battalion of T-34s, one of which was commanded by the notorious tank ace Emil Seibold, who destroyed around 40 tanks with his T-34.

The Polish Army, the Czechoslovakian corps and the army of Yugoslavia all received tanks of this model.
