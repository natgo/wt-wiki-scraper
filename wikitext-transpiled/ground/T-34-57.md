== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before [[Update 1.41]]. The 57 mm ZiS-4 gun can prove to be formidable at its battle rating, providing a noticeable improvement in penetration power, better aerodynamics and faster fire rate than the 76 mm calibre T-34s at the same BR, with a slight sacrifice in post-penetration damage and a higher chance of ricochet on angled surfaces compared to guns of higher calibre. The tank's armaments make fighting at long and short range a boon.

Operational and visual characteristics of the T-34-57 are as similar and as common to previous 76 mm-armed T-34 lineage of tanks as they come, with the exception of a gun of smaller calibre and higher penetration power. Players experienced in operating previous models of the T-34 in Rank II should have little to no difficulty in adjusting to this vehicle. Due to the similarities, however, the tank inevitably inherits both its predecessors' strengths and weaknesses. It is to be noted that armour is ineffective against the occasional Rank III guns; usage of speed and agility to move quickly, to avoid enemy fire and moving cover-to-cover will prove advantageous.

The T-34-57 works very well with other allied tanks (British and American) that it is often paired with in RB and SB. It retains high mobility and an effective main gun, allowing it to quickly reach capture points or tactical firing positions, usually following [[M18 GMC|M18]]s and other T-34 tanks, which are often first at the scene.

The T-34-57 can be played in a variety of roles. The gun is very accurate and has high penetration, making it a great sniper. The tank is fast and manoeuvrable, making it a good flanker. It can also brawl due to its fast turret rotation and great reload speed. However, don't expect to take many hits. At this tier, the T-34's armour will not stand up to enemy guns, even when angled. The best thing to do is keep to the flanks or just behind the battle line and take out enemy tanks at the range and from cover.

In lower tier battles, the T-34 will be in its element, picking off common foes like Pz.IVs and Shermans with ease at long range. The 57 mm gun performs very well at long range against these tanks, so don't be afraid to hold back. However, you are just as effective pushing towards capture points. At lower tiers your armour is still quite effective, so angling can make you very difficult to penetrate. Just be aware that your turret armour is quite weak.

At higher BRs, you will be less effective. There are many tanks that you will not be able to penetrate from the front. The [[M4A3E2|Sherman Jumbo]] and [[Churchill VII]] are notable opponents. Their armour is very thick at the front, bar some small weak spots (machine gun ports). Luckily you will be working with tanks like the T-34-85, SU-85 and even the IS-1, which can destroy the Jumbo under 500 m. Leave the front line combat to them. You can flank and hit your enemies from the side. It is the only way for you to be fully effective. At the top tier, the 57 mm will have gone from being a highly effective precision weapon to a relatively hit and miss weapon. Some targets you can penetrate, others you will need to retreat from.

Pretty much any tank can be penetrated by the 57 mm gun at this tier, but there are a few enemies worth noting.

[[M4A3E2|M4A3E2 Jumbo]] - This tank is the bane of everybody's life at this BR. Its turret in almost impossible to penetrate without APCR (which the T-34-57 does not have), its hull is VERY bouncy, and its gun can easily penetrate your armour. Avoid approaching from the front and flank with your superior mobility and speed if possible. Shoot at the font section of the Jumbo's sides to ammo rack it. If you find yourself backed into a corner, you can try and aim for the machine gun port in the hull. The explosive power of the 57 mm isn't great, but penetrating this point means that you can at least cripple the Jumbo and make your escape.

Panzer IV variants with KwK 40 L/43/48 75 mm guns - These tanks are common at this tier and they can easily take you out with their powerful 75 mm guns. However, they are easy to take out if you get the jump on them. Your high penetration 57 mm gun can slice through their armour at any range.

[[8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl.]] - The flak truck can destroy you at seriously long range, whilst its thin armour and large size makes it very hard to effectively damage. Your rounds may simply pass straight through and not cause any damage. The best way to take one out is by aiming for the large ammo box at the back of the vehicle, which will explode when hit. The crew members are also very exposed on the Flak.

Other T-34 tanks (except 1940 variant) - Many of the T-34 variants ([[T-34 (1941)|1941]], [[T-34 (1942)|1942]], [[T-34E STZ]], etc.), including the T-34-57, can comfortably penetrate each others' armour at reasonable distances. When playing AB, you are likely to come up against other T-34 variants. Since you play this tank, it's easier to know your strengths and weaknesses. Make sure the hostile T-34 is not looking your way, then fire into the main hull or the turret to knock out the crew or blow up an ammo rack. Retreat to a safe distance before re-engaging. If direct confrontation is inevitable, angle your hull and fire into the front of the hostile tank to at least disable them and give you time to re-position, finish destroying the enemy, or escape.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The gun has good penetration and rate of fire
* Very accurate gun with almost no recoil, and fast reload rate, making it easy for follow-up shots
* It's fast and nimble, like all the T-34 series
* The turret isn't the one mounted on the [[T-34 (1942)]], so it offers a smaller silhouette
* Its high penetration APHE ammunition is effective against all Rank II-III heavy tanks at close range
* Shells travel at an astounding 990 m/s, combined with good accuracy makes sniping a viable option
* Although it is thin, your armour is sloped and can cause some lucky ricochets

'''Cons:'''

* The weak spot on the driver's hatch is problematic
* Still uses the 1940 hull, and the armour is inadequate for its rank
* Guns at this rank can now easily penetrate the front plate
* Turret cheeks are easily penetrated, causing turret crew and gun to be knocked out
* The 57 mm gun rarely knocks out enemies in a single shot
* Can face tanks which the main gun will really start to struggle with, such as the [[M4A3E2|M4A3E2 Jumbo]]
* Awkward to place bushes on upper front hull due to the obstruction of MG port and driver's optics
* Poor gun depression of only -5 degrees makes it ineffective in hilly and mountainous terrain

===Development===
As far back as the summer of 1940, an attempt to improve the anti-tank gun inventory in Soviet service was undertaken. This was due to only having massive stocks of underpowered 45 mm anti-tank cannons available, which were becoming obsolete with the newer armour being used by the Soviet Union's adversaries. When the request for an improved anti-tank cannon was sent out, a design bureau headed by V. G. Grabin was already underway under the name ''57 mm ZiS-2 anti-tank gun''. The 57 mm was a very powerful anti-tank weapon due to its high penetration value with the high-velocity shells. The APCBC round available under the name BR-271 was able to penetrate 93 mm of armour when fired 100 m away at a meet angle of 60 degrees. The first of the prototypes were created in the September of 1940, and it as later approved for production on June 1, 1941. However, this was stopped on December 1 due to beliefs that the high-velocity 57 mm shells would simply penetrate straight through tanks without causing damage or that it was a high-cost weapon. The production lines were then switched to produce the 76.2 mm ZiS-3 guns.

It was during its production life before being cancelled that the 57 mm gun was attached to a T-34 as a main armament in April 1941. However, the trials on this armament showed a lack of accuracy and short barrel life. Then in July, an improved variant of the 57 mm called the ''ZiS-4'' was installed onto the T-34 and tested again. This variant turned out to be successful and the gun was recommended for installation on certain T-34 units, despite the high cost of the ZiS-4. The T-34 with the 57 mm was redesignated the '''T-34-57''' and had the purpose of being "tank-hunters" due to the higher penetration value of the 57 mm compared to the default T-34 76.2 mm armament. The 57 mm ZiS-4 gun was produced at the Artillery Factory #92 and were mounted on various T-34s. However, the stop of all 57 mm production on December 1941 also stopped the 57 mm ZiS-4 production, thus halting the T-34-57 production with only 133 ZiS-4 guns made in the production life.

===Revitalization===
The 57 mm guns were revived in 1943 due to urgent needs for much better guns against the newer German tanks. The current 76.2 mm F-34 gun on the normal [[T-34 (1942)|T-34s]] were unable to defeat the newer German [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]] and [[Panther D|Panther]] tanks. In a desperate attempt to upgrade the T-34 to compete against these tanks, the 57 mm was reinstated for production and began being issued in May 1943, these models being the '''[[T-34-57 (1943)|T-34-57 mod. 1943]]''' due to the upgraded armament. The ZiS-4 was upgraded to the ZiS-4M with simplified parts and standardization in parts from current existing artillery pieces such as the F-34 and the ZiS-2. These T-34-57s saw further action against the Axis until they were retired. In total, about less than 324 T-34-57s were made during its production life in 1941 and 1943.

===Combat usage===
The T-34-57 made in 1941 saw action during the Battle of Moscow in small quantities. The 21st Tank Brigade has 10 of such tanks in their units and were deployed on October 14. Though the brigade was able to cause massive damage to the German lines around Kalinin but ended with all of the T-34-57 destroyed by November 25. Other units using the T-34-57 were the 8th Tank Brigade on October 19. Afterwards came the deactivation of the 57 mm from the production line at the end of 1941, but the T-34-57s were revitalized again in 1943 to counter the newer German tanks. These tanks were used as "tank-hunters" and formed "Special Tank Company 100" with three T-34-57 in its first platoon to deal with German tanks. Despite their role, the company would only meet German tanks once in its life, and the first platoon was never used. Thus, the T-34-57 was never really able to prove their efficiency against active German tanks, though the unit would praise the gun's performance in practices against pillboxes, bunkers, and knocked out German tanks. All the T-34-57s were disbanded with the retirement of the 57 mm as a tank gun. This was due to its small HE shell available that made it an inadequate tank armament against softer targets, and also the introduction of the much bigger and better 85 mm tank gun on the newer [[T-34-85 (D-5T)|T-34-85]].

Work on the tank began in the summer of 1940 with a view to upgrading its armament. At that time, the new 57 mm ZiS-2 anti-tank gun was put into operation. In April 1941, the weapon was installed on the tank and tested on a ballistic range. The tests were unsuccessful and the cannon required significant modifications, which were performed on a tight schedule. In July of the same year, the improved weapon was installed on the tank again. This time, the results were much better - the improved ZiS-4 version, designed specifically for tanks, could now destroy targets at a sighting distance of up to 2,000 m. At maximum distance, the weapon penetrated 73-82 mm thick armour, and at minimum distance, 83-98 mm thick armour. After these successful tests, the anti-tank gun was put into service under the designation ZiS-4.

The tanks, designated T-34-57, were intended to go into production in the summer of 1941, but this deadline was pushed back by several months due to the beginning of the war. By the end of 1941, the No. 183 and STZ factories produced 42 of these tanks in total, 20 and 22 respectively. Production of the tanks was stopped due to the sufficient power of the F-34 cannon. The ZiS-2 and ZiS-4 cannons were taken out of production since their power was considered excessive for 1941. In summer-autumn, messages came from the front saying that the shell had penetrated straight through German tanks on multiple occasions, causing them no significant harm.

T-34-57 tanks served in separate tank brigades. The tanks took part in the Battle of Moscow in the 21st Tank Brigade. On the whole, the vehicles performed well with the new cannon, but by 25 November 1941, all of them had been lost.
