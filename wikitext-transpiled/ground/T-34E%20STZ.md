== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''T-34E STZ''' is the heavily modified second variant of the [[T-34 (Family)|T-34 medium tank family]]. When the Germans were confronted with the significantly better-protected T-34 medium tanks during Operation Barbarossa, they promptly began improving their current designs to combat it. In response, many early T-34 variations, such as the T-34E STZ ("ehkranami" - screened), had additional armour plates welded to the front in an attempt to improve the tank's protection. The frontal hull protection was significantly increased over the original [[T-34 (1941)|T-34 (1941) variant]]. This modification was principally performed in the STZ factory in Stalingrad in January 1942.

Introduced in [[Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory"]], the T-34E STZ is essentially an armoured derivative of the T-34 (1941) variant. It is not a distinct variant in and of itself since nothing was modified from the T-34 (1941) variant, except the addition of a thin armour plate to the frontal hull. The gameplay is nearly identical to those of the other early T-34 variants ([[T-34 (1941)|1941]] and [[T-34 (1942)|1942]]). With the same long-barrelled 76.2 mm F-34 tank gun and an extensive selection of ammunition, players will be glad to discover that the T-34E STZ is significantly better protected against adversaries from the front. While the T-34E STZ's increased armour substantially improves frontal protection, it does slow the tank down.

==== Ammunition ====
The available ammunition allows for engaging all types of targets:

* '''BR-350A (MD-5 fuze)''': APHEBC; a shell with high explosive mass that will knock out enemies with a single shot but has an average penetration power.
* '''BR-350B (MD-8 fuze)''': APHEBC; increased penetration at the cost of slightly less explosive filler.
* '''BR-350SP''': APBC; a solid shot with an even better penetration but no explosive filler.
* '''BR-354P''': APCR; a composite round with the best penetration but no explosive filler and will only penetrate flat vertical surfaces.
* '''BP-353A''': HEAT; a shaped charge with average penetration but without penetration loss over distance. Only penetrates flat vertical surfaces but the post-penetration damage is very effective on open and lightly armoured vehicles. Very slow shell travelling twice slower than your other projectiles.
* '''OF-350M''': HE; useful for destroying open and lightly armoured vehicles.
* '''Sh-354T''': Shrapnel; useful against vehicles that are resistant to the HE shells but too thinly armoured to trigger the fuzes of AP shells.
* '''D-350A''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives.

The small calibre of the DT machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight. The clip capacity is quite poor as it relies on a magazine of 63 bullets instead of a belt like similar machine guns from other nations.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

There are two main ways to utilize this tank. The first is by staying at long range, and using the frontal armour and good gun to pick off enemies. When at long range remember that the front turret is the greatest weakness of this tank so try to not look directly at the enemy during reloading. The second is as a close-range brawler when using the tank in this manner make sure to watch the flanks. Both of these methods are equally viable, at close range seems to be where this tank does a little better.

The first option is to go straight for a cap point and find a good position just outside or just inside the point. Any position that has a good overwatch of the cap point or the approaches to the cap point will do. Once in position try to knock out any tank that tries to approach the point, make sure to properly angle the armour to maximize protection. If aware of where the enemy is coming from, it is easy to maximize the armour protection and engage enemies with an advantage. Always engage in the most favourable conditions, these means don't hesitate to retreat if starting to get overwhelmed. If the enemy follows through while retreating, they could expose themselves to allies to take them out.

The second option is to try to flank around them and approach the enemy from an angle they might not expect. When doing this try to make sure to have a good knowledge of the terrain, since choosing the wrong path means a bad encounter and demise. A good path is one where enemies appear in a predictable location and allow for disengagements with easy withdrawal. Ideal paths have a hill between the T-34E and the enemy, allowing the T-34E to manoeuvre slowly around the hill until the enemy is in sight. Once the enemy is sighted, engage if applicable. If the enemy starts charging, fight a fighting retreat using the hill as cover. However remember if moving around the flanks, it will be harder to receive team support if away from the main body of allies.

*'''Urban'''<br>

Urban settings can be challenging for the T-34E STZ. The reason for this is while the frontal armour is great, in the chaos of urban combat means that no one may know where the enemy is at.  Another problem; while the front armour is good it does have a number of weak spots which can be easily targeted at point blank range. With that in mind, play the STZ as in a 1941 or 1942, and do not rely on the armour as with a KV-1. Try to use the flanks and side streets to get into firing position where enemies can come from a predictable path. This will allow maximum usage of the T-34E's mobility and protection to the fullest. The T-34E's agility is its main defence in these settings.

*'''Open Field'''<br>

In this type of environment, tank destroyers will always reign supreme. Their combinations of high-power guns, low profile, and tough frontal armour make them great long range combatants. However, the T-34E's armour allows the tank to play along, but always remember that it is not invulnerable, and while the F-34 gun cannot match those of tank destroyers', it can still get the job done. This means that the T-34E should not position itself in the open and take shots, try to find a location where the tank is protected from most angles and focus on one enemy at a time. By focusing on one tank at a time, it will minimize the odds of a lucky shot hitting weak spots.

*'''Hill Country'''<br>

This is the type of environment where T-34 STZ can really shine. The reason for this is that unlike in urban environments flaking can be a little more difficult. The average distance of engagement is longer, meaning the enhanced armour can do more than in urban environments. The more open nature allows the T-34E to make full use of the tank's mobility. When in this environment, there is a range of options and tactics to take on the enemy.

Some enemies to be concerned about:

* [[M4A3 (105)]] - Treat like a Sherman Firefly, an up-gunned Sherman. Avoid getting hit, as its 105 mm shells can cause major damage and perhaps send the player back to the garage. Try hitting the side or the gun mantlet to OHK or disable the gun respectively.
* [[M10 GMC]] - This tank destroyer will comfortably destroy the T-34E with the 3-inch gun if it gets a chance to. Treat it like the Pz. IV F2, fragile but powerful. Make sure it isn't looking towards the T-34E's way, then shoot it in the main hull and it will, at the very least, fatally incapacitate it.
* [[M18 GMC]] - Fight similarly to the M10 or Pz. IV F2. Be wary of close quarters engagements due to their outstanding mobility. Vulnerable to overpressure, consider using HE or HEAT rounds.
* [[M4A3E2]] Jumbo - The frontal armour on the Jumbo is difficult to penetrate even with APCR shells, the only weak point being the machine gun port. If encountered, get out of its line of sight and try to flank it if possible. A good location to target is the lower hull side, behind the tracks. This section has not been uparmoured and a good shot below the crew compartment can detonate the ammo racks and send the Jumbo back to the hangar.
* [[Pz.IV F2]] - Despite its thin armour, the Pz. IV F2 has a gun fully capable of penetrating the T-34E's armour easily. If encountered, move to a safe position where it is still observable. Wait until it is not targeting directly at the T-34E, then shoot it in the main hull. Often one shot is all it takes. Alternatively, if feeling lucky, try to get the first shot off into the front of the tank. It should, if not an instant knock-out, at least disable a few crucial crew members and/or modules.
* [[StuG III G]] / [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)]] - You will have trouble frontally penetrating these German tank destroyers. Don't challenge these front on. Try to ambush them if you can, or take out their tracks and go for their vulnerable side. Don't count on your armour to protect you from them, since they can penetrate you almost anywhere.
* [[Achilles]] - An M10 with a more powerful gun. Treat like the M10, except more carefully. However, the poor turret traverse and long reload mean that if it's facing in a different direction or if it just fired, there is the possible risk of exposing the T-34E STZ and taking a shot into the main hull.
* [[Sherman Firefly]] - A Sherman with a more powerful gun. Its frontal armour, like all Shermans, is difficult for the F-34 gun to penetrate. Its gun is also more powerful than the traditional Sherman, making it even more problematic to deal with. If possible, engage from the side and fire into it. Otherwise, treat like the Jumbo and avoid entirely.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* A smaller turret than the [[T-34 (1942) | previous T-34]] (More difficult to hit flat parts)
* Turret cheeks have a relatively flat and angled edge compared to the pronounced curve of the 1940/1941 T-34 variants, slightly harder to penetrate
* Better front armour (60 mm) than the previous T-34
* Good firepower: adequate penetration and good post-penetration damage for the APHE shells
* Lots of ammunition variety
* Good top speed and hull traverse allows it to reposition quickly

'''Cons:'''

* The added armour does not cover all the front armour, machine gun port is still a large weak spot in close quarters engagements
* Turret armour, especially the cheeks, are still big weak points
* Weak side armour
* Slower reload than the 1942 variant
* Bad gun depression of -5 degrees makes it inferior in hilly maps, especially against US whose tanks all have -10 degrees depression
* Awkward to place bushes on upper front hull due to the obstruction of MG port and driver's optics

The '''[[T-34 (1941)|T-34]]''' was beginning to become the main tank of the Soviet Army by 1941, however, the initiation of Operation Barbarossa by the Germans postponed most manufacturing deadlines due to the relocation of various factories to the Ural Mountains to keep them safe from the Germans. During the movement, only the Dzherzhinski Tractor Factory in Stalingrad (STZ) stayed in production and produced most of the T-34s during the relocation.

To increase the survivability of the tanks, the T-34 design in the STZ factory was up-armoured by use of applique armour plates. These applique armour variants of the T-34 were called [[T-34E]], with "E" meaning "ekranami" translates to "with screens" in Russian. These tanks were given applique armour throughout the entire vehicle, on all sides of the turret, one the front, on the sides, and even side skirts on the tracks. Some of the applique armour was placed in a way to act as spaced armour against enemy fire, which proved quite effective against the [[Pz.III L|Panzer III]]'s 50 mm KwK 39 cannon where the armour applied were on areas once vulnerable on the T-34 to the cannon. However, it was found that this additional armour did not help the T-34 against larger calibres such as the 75 mm PaK 40 and the 88 mm FlaK cannons. Due to the gradually growing number of tanks with the 75 mm and 88 mm, such as the up-gunned [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV]] and the [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]] that could easily destroy the T-34 even with the armour application, the armour configuration was not placed into mass production and thus only the testing batch of 47 units were made from the design.

However, one armour applique model produced in STZ did see more widespread use in the production line, though it still had the name '''T-34E''' as its main nomenclature (called the '''T-34E STZ''' in-game). This up-armoured model was more successful than the previous due to not drastically changing the design and only focusing on front armour protection by welding 15 mm of armour onto the front hull, thus minimizing weight gain by only focusing on the area most expected to be hit. The tank also featured redesigned road wheels and track designs. These T-34Es saw more widespread use and have photographs showing it being used in the Leningrad Front.
