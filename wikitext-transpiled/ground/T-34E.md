== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a premium pack in June 2014 during [[Update 1.41]]. and was removed from the Gaijin store in [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/336443-shop-clearance-sale-in-the-store-50-discount October 2016]. It was also available in the Steam store from June 2014 to August 2018, when it was removed to become a reward for the [[wt:en/news/5650-marathon-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-assemble-a-tank-updated-en|2018 "Operation S.U.M.M.E.R."]] crafting event.

The feature of this tank is its 16 mm of spaced armour around its turret and sides, which in some occasions will bounce incoming shells when angled correctly. The T-34E is a truly unique tank for the collector, and also very useful often outperforming other T-34s. The extra spaced armour can be truly life-saving in certain situations.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret rear, turret roof, gun mantlet)
* Cast homogeneous armour (turret flanks, glacis joint, driver's hatch, machine gun port)
* High hardness rolled homogeneous armour (side skirts, sides and turret spaced armour)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspensions wheels and tracks are 20 mm thick.
* Additional 10 mm armour plates cover the engine air intakes on the hull roof.
* There is no cupola on this tank.
* Never try to shoot through the driver's hatch: it is a guaranteed ricochet.
* Frontally, the weak spots are turret cheeks and gun mantlet (under the gun).

Being a T-34 (1941) with spaced armour, the {{PAGENAME}} reacts like any other low-rank T-34, but stronger.

With the 16 mm of spaced armour, the upper side of the tank is almost impossible to penetrate when angled. While angling, the upper frontal plate will also be unlikely for a shell to penetrate, therefore only exposing the turret.

The {{PAGENAME}} suffers from its weak turret like other early T-34s do. Even with the spaced armour, the {{PAGENAME}} still cannot stop most other enemy shells. So during engagements, try not to expose your turret by hiding behind an object. Also, when the {{PAGENAME}} is not angled, the upper frontal plate is very weak since there is no spaced armour there. So to minimize the chance to expose the weak spots, you should angle the tank 45 degrees to bounce incoming shells.

When getting hit by an enemy, some shells can penetrate the tank, and depending on the type of shells and the type of gun, the result may be very different. Against cannons larger than 75 mm, the {{PAGENAME}}'s interior will be decimated. However, you will have a good chance to survive shells that are smaller with AP (Armour-Piercing) related shells. When suffering damage, most times your gunner and loader will be knocked out, or sometimes the cannon breech will be damaged. Therefore you should train your crew with high repair and agility skills.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=775|rbMinHp=442}}

The {{PAGENAME}} has a decent top speed of 42 km/h, it is slightly slower than its other twins [[T-34 (1940)]] and [[T-34 (1941)|(1941)]] because of the extra weight of the spaced armour. With this speed, you will be able to reach certain positions before other medium tank counterparts. To use this speed to the fullest, players are suggested to flank around the map and get side shots of enemies. The reverse speed of the {{PAGENAME}} is mediocre, which means that players should not attempt to overextend when attacking, or this often results in destruction.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|F-34 (76 mm)}}

The gun on T-34E is the same on [[T-34 (1941)]] and [[T-34 (1942)|(1942)]], the F-34 cannon is a decent gun at this battle rating and offers a large number of different shells. All of the shells are useful in their own ways, but most players prefer using BR-350B, this is because of its performance in combat. BR-350B is classified as an APHEBC shell, which means that once the shell enters a tank, in most situations, it will explode and destroy the enemy at once. The reloading speed is average compared to other tanks in this tier, so you should avoid blind shooting just in case.

Like many other T-34s, the amount of ammunition does not affect combat by much, because of the location of the ammo rack. The ammo rack is located under the loader and the gunner, which is an unlikely place for one to shoot.

==== Ammunition ====
The available ammunition allows for engaging all types of targets:

* '''BR-350A (MD-5 fuze)''': APHEBC; a shell with high explosive mass that will knock out any tank with a single shot but has an average penetration power.
* '''BR-350B (MD-8 fuze)''': APHEBC; increased penetration at the cost of slightly less explosive filler.
* '''BR-350SP''': APBC; a solid shot with an even better penetration but no explosive filler.
* '''BR-354P''': APCR; a composite round with the best penetration but no explosive filler and will only penetrate flat vertical surfaces.
* '''BR-350A''': HEAT; a shaped charge with average penetration but without penetration loss over distance. Only penetrates flat vertical surfaces but the post-penetration damage is very effective on open and lightly armoured vehicles. Very slow shell travelling twice slower than your other projectiles.
* '''OF-350M''': HE; useful for destroying open and lightly armoured vehicles.
* '''Sh-354T''': Shrapnel; useful against vehicles that are resistant to the HE shells but too thinly armoured to trigger the fuzes of AP shells.
* '''D-350A''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|DT (7.62 mm)}}

The T-34E has two machine guns, one located in front of the machine gunner, and one beside the gun, but in-game only the turret machine gun is functional. The use of this DT machine gun is limited, with the controls being stuck with the turret, the machine gun cannot shoot aircraft. Instead, use the machine gun to blind the enemy and sometimes shoot open-topped tanks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In ground RB, T-34E can be used in many styles, it can either be a flanker or it can be a front line attacker, it can even be a sniper at times. But no matter what style you play, always angle the armour to avoid being penetrated and remember that you always have the choice to cover the tank with decorations to further confuse the enemy.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Bouncy sloped armour, effective against low-calibre guns (e.g. [[Churchill I]])
* Decent top speed and good hull traverse
* Great firepower with several ammunition choices and useful primary shells
* Add-on side armour allows safer angling and side-scraping
* Fast turret rotation, useful to deal with flankers or multiple targets

'''Cons:'''

* Poor gun depression of only -5 degrees makes it ineffective in mountain combat
* No smoke launcher
* Lack of spaced frontal armour
* Awkward to place bushes on upper front hull due to the obstruction of MG port and driver's optics
* Armour doesn't hold up against experienced tankers or long-barreled guns (e.g. [[StuG III G]], [[Achilles]])

== History ==

The [[T-34 (1941)|T-34]] was beginning to become the main tank of the Soviet Army by 1941, however, the initiation of Operation Barbarossa by the Germans postponed most manufacturing deadlines due to the relocation of various factories to the Ural Mountains to keep them safe from the Germans. During the movement, only the Dzherzhinski Tractor Factory in Stalingrad (STZ) stayed in production and produced most of the T-34s during the relocation.

To increase the survivability of the tanks, the T-34 design in the STZ factory was up-armoured by use of applique armour plates. These applique armour variants of the T-34 were called '''T-34E''', with "E" meaning "ekranami" translates to "with screens" in Russian. These tanks were given applique armour throughout the entire vehicle, on all sides of the turret, one the front, on the sides, and even side skirts on the tracks. Some of the applique armour was placed in a way to act as spaced armour against enemy fire, which proved quite effective against the [[Pz.III L|Panzer III]]'s 50 mm KwK 39 cannon where the armour applied were on areas once vulnerable on the T-34 to the cannon. However, it was found that this additional armour did not help the T-34 against larger calibres such as the 75 mm PaK 40 and the 88 mm FlaK cannons. Due to the gradually growing number of tanks with the 75 mm and 88 mm, such as the up-gunned [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV]] and the [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]] that could easily destroy the T-34 even with the armour application, the armour configuration was not placed into mass production and thus only the testing batch of 47 units were made from the design.
However, one armour applique model produced in STZ did see more widespread use in the production line, though it still had the name '''T-34E''' as its main nomenclature (also called the [[T-34E STZ]] in-game). This up-armoured model was more successful than the previous due to not drastically changing the design and only focusing on front armour protection by welding 15 mm of armour onto the front hull, thus minimizing weight gain by only focusing on the area most expected to be hit. The tank also featured redesigned road wheels and track designs. These T-34Es saw more widespread use and have photographs showing it being used in the Leningrad Front.

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
Up-armoured T-34 tanks were produced between the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1942 at the STZ factory. In total, 3,644 of them were made. The vehicles' frontal hull armour was increased to 60 mm thickness and their frontal turret armour to 75 mm thickness. This was achieved by welding on add-on armour plates. A key character of these tanks was their fully metallic road wheels with radial hole patterns in the wheel disc. Such wheels were necessary due to a shortage of rubber for road wheel bands. The tank's idler wheels were also fully metallic. The turret's rear panel was fully welded, while its upper and side panels were held together by joints. The front of the turret featured characteristic lateral slots, while the cannon's recoil mechanisms were armoured with a straight frontal piece.

The up-armoured T-34E tanks were used in battle from the summer of 1942 to the beginning of 1944. Some captured vehicles of this type were used by Wehrmacht troops in 1942-1943. These had both the standard 4BO green with Wehrmacht identifying markings and the camouflage used by German forces.
