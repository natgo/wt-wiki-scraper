The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Soviet medium tank which was supposed to replace T-34 in service as the main tank of the Red Army. The T-44-122 is the third prototype after the first two prototypes armed with 85 mm D-5T guns. The 122 mm D-25-44T gun was used, unlike the regular D-25T it was using a single piece ammunition to increase rate of fire aswell as double buffle muzzle break. The tank underwent first trials between February and March 1944 but unsuccessfuly as the gun failed and had to be returned to factory for repairs. Second trials were conducted between April and May 1944 where the T-44-122 competed with a captured German Panther tank and second of the 85 mm armed T-44 prototypes. The T-44-122 had practical rate of fire of two to three rounds per minute and very limited ammo storage of only 24 rounds, which were both deemed insufficient. As a result all further development was suspended and only development of the 85 mm armed variant continued.

The T-44-122 was introduced in [[Update 1.55 "Royal Armour"]] as a GE premium. Unlike the [[T-44]], the T-44-122 features a driver hatch weakspot where the armour is partially flat and extending from the hull, but comes with a [[D-25T (122 mm)|122 mm gun]] instead, giving the tank a very high boost in firepower compared to its previous [[ZIS-S-53 (85 mm)|85 mm cannon]]. The mobility and armour however are excellent and the tank could be played as a sniper due to its powerful gun, or as a brawler seeking cover while reloading before advancing further.

Flank and spank. The T-44-122 plays almost identically to the -85 variant T-34/44s, but obviously gets the added bonus of being able to penetrate most vehicles frontally in an emergency.

Most ~6.3 British vehicles with stabilizers (etc. [[FV4202]]) are extremely dangerous as they have APDS/AP that can shear through the T-44's armour like butter. Additionally, the [[Tiger II (H)]] can only be penetrated through the turret but thankfully such a target is much less mobile than the aforementioned vehicles and also lacks a stabilizer.
[[File:Wsp volumetric shell diagram.png|thumb|Differences between non-volumetric shells and volumetric shells hitting a Tiger I]]
An important note when engaging tanks, especially Tiger Is, is that, with the implementation of volumetric shells, you can no longer expect your shells to pierce through small openings or right past an obstacle. The large 122 mm calibre of your shells will result in it catching on an armour plate's edge very often, losing all of its penetration. For example, a Tiger I has some edges that can absorb your shell unexpectedly, despite having flat armour. Thus you must always make sure that where you are aiming at is absolutely free of obstruction, or it may result in a non-penetration or a ricochet. This can be seen in the diagram to the right.

==== Specific Enemies Worth Noting ====
These are common vehicles you will see in this tank:

* ☠ [[T32]] - You have to go for the MG port in the lower left of the UFP, otherwise you can only penetrate the side armour or the rear.
* ☠ [[T28]] - You can only penetrate the cupolas on top of the tank. If they're hidden or you are unsure about the shot, you can try hitting the cannon barrel and running away.
* ☠ [[Ferdinand]] - Go for the angled armour at the sides of the lower front plate (below the casemate, but above the lowest plates), this will disable Ferdinand's engine and/or driver, so you can flank and finish it off.
* ☠ [[Jagdtiger]] - You cannot reliably penetrate or damage this tank frontally. You can try disabling the cannon barrel, and then flanking is your best option (or running away).
* ☠ [[Conqueror]] - Shoot the hull, don't shoot the turret.
* ☠ [[Ho-Ri Production]] - You cannot reliably penetrate or damage this tank frontally. You can try disabling the cannon barrel and then flanking is your best option (or running).
* ☠ [[AMX-50 Foch]] - You cannot reliably penetrate or damage this tank frontally. You can try disabling the cannon barrel and then flanking is your best option (or running).
* [[T34]] / [[T29]] - Turret cheeks can work, although it's best to go for the LFP because the ammo storage is very low in the tank. If you don't see the LFP, try going just below the turret ring, where the driver sits.
* [[Tiger II (H)]] / [[Panther II]] - You can easily penetrate the turret cheeks with BR-471B.
* [[Panther tank (Family)|Panther]] [[Panther D|D]], [[Panther A|A]], [[Panther G|G]], [[Panther F|F]] - You can penetrate the UFP
* [[Tortoise]] - Shoot to the right of the gun of the Tortoise, when you see it head-on if shoot on the left plate there is a chance to knock it out with a single shot.
* [[AMX-50 Surbaissé]] - Go for the LFP.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Armed with the same devastating 122mm gun found on the IS heavy tanks
* The top APHE shell is really good at overmatching angled armour. Can cut through the upper front plate of the Panther at ranges excess of 500 m
* About the same size as many light tanks at the rank, meaning this tank is fairly easy to conceal
* Ridiculous mobility and top speed. Can keep up with nearly every light tank in the game
* Unlike many Soviet tanks having only 3 degrees of gun depression, this tank has 5 degrees. Hull down fighting and hill fighting is a lot easier to preform
* The armour is decent. Can effectively side scrape
* This tank is both a fantastic flanker/ambushing tank

'''Cons:'''

* Can only carry 24 shells into battle
* Even with an ACE crew, the gun has a horrifying reload speed of 23 seconds
* 5 degrees of gun depression still isn't very good
* Worse upper plate armour than any other T44
* Slow reverse speed
* Unlike the other T44s, this tank has such a bad reload speed means that brawling is not advised
* Getting jumped by two or more tanks is almost certain death thanks to the guns terrible reload speed

===Development===
In the autumn of 1943 at the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, the designers started working on a vehicle under orders of Stalin to have major improvements over the initial T-34s. The mobility of the [[T-34-85|T-34]] medium tank was to be similar, but with more armour on it. In November, chief designer A. A. Morozov presented a design and model, and it was designated the '''[[T-44]]''' (Object 136). The first prototype was completed on January the next year and two more in February. The first two prototypes are armed with the 85 mm D-5T gun with the designation T-44-85, while the last had a 122 mm D-25-44T cannon similar to the one on the [[IS-2]] tank (Though differing from one-piece ammunition and better muzzle brake) designated the [[T-44-122]]. An innovative feature that allowed the mounting of heavy guns on a 30-ton design was the placement of the engine perpendicular to the axis of the tank. This allowed the hull to be made without sponsons, gave the crew a much bigger fighting compartment, had the turret placed on the centre of the vehicle and reduced the vehicle's overall length. However, the ammo stored on the left side of the tank was easily hit and could detonate, destroying the tank. The armour on the design featured 75 mm thick plate on the front, 90 mm on the turret mantlet, side armour is 45 mm thick with the capability of mounting an additional 30 mm of armour. These prototypes had a V-2IS diesel engine delivering 500 horsepower. The tank provided many advantages over the T-34 design, the gun accuracy on the T-44 design was arguably better, and the turret ring was more reliable. It presented more than double frontal armour without significantly affecting weight distribution. The increased fighting compartment meant that the turret floor ammunition storage on the T-34 could be removed. Tank height comparison, the T-44 was 300 mm lower than the T-34, and the driver's vision from his hatch is much better than on the T-34.

===Testing and cancellation===
Trials with the first prototypes began in February 1944. One of the competition was against the German [[Panther G|Panther tank]]. Compared to the T-44-85, the T-44-122 was flawed and unsatisfactory. The large gun made the interiors cramped and unable for the crew inside to work properly. The rate of fire with the 122 mm, even when using single-piece ammunition, was very slow with a maximum of only three rounds per minute. This compounded with the fact that the T-44-122 could only hold 24 rounds inside the tank, makes the T-44 with the 122 mm gun unsatisfactory for the role of a medium tank. Thus, all further development on the 122 mm armed T-44 is cancelled for further development on the 85 mm variant, which continued on to finally being accepted into service on November 1944 and with 1,823 units built from 1944 to 1947.
