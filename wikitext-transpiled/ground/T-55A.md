== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]].

After active development of nuclear weapons, the [[T-54/55 (Family)|T-54]] was tested against nuclear charges. It was evaluated that the crew could survive only at distances of over 700 m, so it was decided to create a new tank that would have a nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection system, or ''Protivoatomnaya Zashchita'' (PAZ). The initial designs for this tank were completed in 1956, however, that was without additional NBC protection. In 1961, the development of an NBC system began, and it was introduced in the new T-55A variant. Among other upgrades, the T-55 had an increased ammunition supply with 18 more rounds being stored in the fuel tanks.

The T-55 became a replacement for Soviet heavy tanks (IS series and the [[T-10M|T-10]]). Armour was sacrificed for better mobility and a better gun. Currently, the T-55A is one of the only vehicles at its rank to still have an AP shell with explosive filler, which can easily knock out most vehicles in a single shot from the sides and some from the front (notably, Leopards 1). Unfortunately, the T-55A is relatively slow compared to other medium tanks at its battle rating.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
[[File:T-55A XRay Side.png|thumb|left|X-Ray view of the T-55A when viewed from the side. Note how packed the tank interior is of critical components, ammunition, and crew.]]

The T-55A has moderate frontal protection, with 100 mm plates for upper front plate (UFP) and lower front plate (LFP) placed at angles 59° and 56° respectively; effective thickness frontally comes up to ~180 mm and ~200 mm, respectively. At a perfect angle, the {{PAGENAME}} can bring its frontal effective thickness to ~200 mm and ~220 mm for the UFP and LFP, while having ~250 mm of protection at the angled sides. However, the additional 20 mm of armour will rarely save the tank from APFSDS, or even APDS, shells that are flying around at this rank.

As for the turret, the T-55A has slightly less protection than the T-62 and combined with a generally larger turret, it is easier for opponents to hit and penetrate the turret. The thinnest spots are right next to the cannon breech, at 200 mm, which rather slowly becomes over 300 mm when moving further away from the breech.

The {{PAGENAME}}'s weakest area to be attacked at is the port side; or when looking directly at the {{PAGENAME}}, its right side. This is because three of the four crew members are neatly lined up into a row. A well placed APFSDS shot to this area through the UFP will one-shot the T-55A.

Despite this vulnerability, it will do well for the {{PAGENAME}}'s overall survival if it does not get hit at all during its lifespan on the battlefield. Due to how packed the interior is, any penetrating shot is sure to cripple or outright destroy the tank.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret roof)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=899|rbMinHp=513}}

The maximum speed that the T-55A can reach is listed as 56 km/h (AB) and 50 km/h (RB/SB). That is ~15 km/h slower than the [[Leopard A1A1]]. However, the amount of firepower that the T-55A brings to the battlefield, coupled together with the ability to withstand shots sometimes, that speed is decent. Backwards, the T-55A can go at up to -7 km/h, which won't let you back out of tricky situations often.

The T-55A cannot turn in neutral gear, which makes it difficult to manoeuvre in close-quarter encounters, which often occur in urban environments. The acceleration is good, the T-55A can get to 25 km/h from a standstill on flat, rough terrain in a few seconds, and turning is decent on flat ground.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

With a default APDS round available, the T-55A is somewhat viable in a downtier to assist going through the modification research. Aside from getting the survivability upgrades in the "Parts" and "FPE" modules, unlocking better ammunition choices should be prioritised in order to access the more potent APFSDS round and the HEAT-FS shell in the "3BM25" and "3BK17M" modules respectively. The "NVD" module should also be researched early in order to survive the possibility of the next ground battle being at night time.

=== Main armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}
<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->

The T-55A houses a 100 mm D-10T2S rifled anti-tank gun, which is equipped with an ejector and two-plane stabilizer arms. In-game, the T-55A has a 10.3 s reload rate, which is similar to its successor, the T-62. This rate of fire doesn't allow the T-55A to rush into battle and fend off waves of Leopards or [[M48 Patton (Family)|M48]]s and [[M60 (Family)|M60]]s, but it is sufficient to defeat one or two opponents in quick succession with good shot placements, granted you shoot first.

==== Ammunition ====
The stock round (3BM-8, APDS) allows the T-55A to penetrate [[MBT-70]] and [[KPz-70]] frontally, as well as deal with all other major threats, notably the [[Leopard I|Leopards]] (which you can penetrate anywhere), and [[Chieftain Mk 3|Chieftains]] (LFP, or UFP/LFP with the APFSDS round). One of the major advantages that the T-55A has over the majority of rank VI vehicles is its APCBC shell, which has the potential to knock out any opponent it penetrates in a single shot. It is advised to flank your enemies and when given the opportunity, easily destroy oncoming enemies with this round.

* If you pack 19&nbsp;''(+24)'' shells, it will fill only the frontal wet stowage ready rack.
* Rack 6 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 18 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
** This rack is also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is: 6 - 1 - 2 - etc. until 5.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-5 into rack 6. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

The T-55A has a roof-mounted 12.7 mm DShK machine gun, which allows it to fight low-flying aircraft or helicopters. However, it is not effective against jets. It is recommended to use this machine gun against lightly armoured ground targets and to check whether or not a tank is alive or not, by shooting its tracks (which can also be done with the coaxial machine gun).

== Usage in battles ==

The T-55A usage in battle is very similar to the T-54 tanks prior to it. Aside from some minor design differences, the general armour layout of the T-55A is similar to that of the preceding [[T-54 (1951)]]. The mobility is slightly better due to a more powerful engine, enabling a higher hp-to-ton ratio despite the small weight increase. The firepower of the T-55A compared to its predecessor is what makes it stand out, with access to the 3BM25 APFSDS ammunition that can penetrate 335 mm at point-blank range (compared to the T-54 (1951)'s point-blank penetration of 299 mm with the 3BM-8 APDS and 380 mm with the 3BK-5 HEATFS shell). The high-velocity and penetrating APFSDS shell allow the T-55A to more easily reach out and destroy long-range enemies. The option to use the BR-412D APCBC shell is also available to use in order to cause devastating post-penetration damages, especially against the [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]] tanks that the APCBC shell can penetrate frontally. However, the presence of other tanks with enough armour to protect against the APCBC shell mean it is only situationally useful. Other helpful differences the T-55A has over the T-54 (1951) is a faster turret traverse rate and stabilizer, the latter of which is very useful when reacting to enemy targets on the move.

The T-55A is suited for a variety of roles and actions when assaulting or defending a point. In these roles, the firepower and mobility is sufficient, but the armour may not stand up against the enemy due to the prevalence of HEATFS and APFSDS ammo at this battle rating. As such, all these tactics should emphasize avoiding being seen and destroyed by the enemy.

[[File:T-55A Weakspot.png|thumb|right|A weak spot of the T-55A's is a shot through the upper front plate, which can knock out three of the four crew members easily.]]

;Assaulting

The T-55A should use its mobility to advance with its allies towards the point. Unless in a downtiered match, try not to take point in the attack to avoid catching a shell right into the upper front plate, which could potentially knock the T-55A out. Avoid hilly terrain (due to the poor gun depression) and close quarter battle in urban terrain as the tank's reload and traverse speed are not sufficient to react to surprise enemy encounters, and the T-55A's rather poor reverse mobility makes retreat difficult, especially in an enclosed area.

The open plain is perhaps one of the better terrain to use the T-55A. The APFSDS dart can allow the T-55A to reach out at enemies that attempt to snipe from a distance. The low profile of the T-55A can even make use of the plain's depression and hills as cover and concealment as it moves closer to the enemies for a better shot.

The T-55A has enough mobility (when upgraded) to try larger flanking manoeuvres against the enemy on more open-spaced maps. Use the T-55A's profile to conceal its advance with the terrain. Use this to get the jump on enemy when they start receiving APFSDS shots from a direction they didn't expect the T-55A to be. Do note however that the T-55A can also encounter enemy flankers like the Leopards, which are faster and have enough firepower to end a T-55A should there be an unexpected encounter during this manoeuvre.

;Defending

The T-55A has a turret traverse that can cover an angle of fire rather quickly, and the APFSDS means it can reach out and hit enemies from a long way before the enemy could get a good visual of the T-55A's position. Establish a zone for the T-55A to cover, preferably one with a choke point that enemies have to funnel through. Coordinate with allies to try and cover all necessary sectors against enemy advances onto a point as while the T-55A can deal with one or so tanks sporadically appearing in its zone, a coordinated attack by the enemy could very quickly overwhelm the T-55A's capacity to defend itself and the point. 

;Specific enemies worth noting

Although the T-55A can make short work of most enemies with its APFSDS round, some enemy vehicle in an uptier can be quite difficult to handle:

* [[XM-803]]/[[Leopard 1A5]]: These tanks are highly mobile and have a sufficiently large enough gun to take out the T-55A. As such, these are enemies to expect to encounter on the T-55A's flanks or when the T-55A is flanking. Although, their armour configuration are thin enough that an APFSDS round can still take them out, so try and spot these tanks first before they could spot the T-55A
* [[Chieftain (Family)|Chieftain]]: The armour configuration on a Chieftain requires more precise aiming than just a general "aim-at-center-mass" attitude. The largest weak point for the Chieftain tanks are their lower front plate, but this could be easily obscured if the Chieftain is acting in a hull-down position. Given their [[Ordnance BL Tk. L11 (120 mm)|120 mm]] guns can reach farther and faster than the T-55A's 100 mm, they can deny a much larger zone from tank travel, making it difficult for the T-55A to approach them when they're defending.
* [[T-64A (1971)|T-64]]: Although this is only encountered in mixed battles, these tanks feature armour array on their hull and turrets that can easily resist the T-55A's gun. Try and take them by surprise with a side shot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Good mobility
* Good gun with a wide ammo choices (APDS, APFSDS, APCBC, HEATFS and smoke)
* Roof-mounted machine gun for anti-air defence
* Comes with a stabiliser, unlike its older series the T-54
* Armour provide full protection to autocannons frontally, the relatively thick side armour of 80mm can protect from many autocannons side on.
* Engine smoke system can aid survivability

'''Cons:'''

* Cramped crew layout makes the vehicle easy to knock out in one shot
* Ready rack placed in fuel tanks provides a deadly weakspot
* Stock performance is quite lacklustre
* No rangefinder
* Engine smoke system can only be used to help retreat and can be negated by vehicles with thermals
* The armour doesn't hold up against sabot or HEAT ammunition

The T-55A is a variant of the extremely-popular T-55 main battle tank produced by the USSR after the Second World War. Along with the earlier T-54 main battle tanks, the T-54/T-55 MBT family is the most-produced tank series in history. The T-55 MBT design featured numerous improvements over the prior T-54s, including additional NBC (Nuclear, Biological & Chemical) protection systems, a new heavier turret, more ammunition, and improved equipment. The T-55A was a late modification of the earlier T-55 MBT, including improved NBC systems.

The T-54/T-55 family of main battle tanks were among the first main battle tanks to be introduced. The tanks were designed as a follow-up to the T-34 and T-44 medium tanks. Notably, the new T-54/T-55 tanks were fitted with a 100 mm rifled gun that was capable of penetrating the most heavily-armoured western tanks of the time but had a faster reload compared to the 122 mm guns used on the IS-series of heavy tanks.

The T-55 was designed as an evolutionary development of the T-54 MBT and included numerous changes compared to the previous tank model. Notably, the T-55 received NBC protection equipment designed to protect against tactical nuclear weapons. The T-55A further improved on the T-55's NBC protection system by introducing a full chemical weapon filtration system along with an anti-radiation lining inside the tank. These improvements greatly increased the crew's survivability against nuclear or chemical warfare. Compared to the T-54, the T-55 had its total shell capacity increased from 34 to 45; the T-55A was able to carry six more shells, through the removal of the hull machine gun.

The T-55A began production in 1963 and continued until 1977; numerous improvements were developed, including the T-55AM, a modified version of the T-55A featuring composite armour. The T-55 family served extensively with countries of the Warsaw Pact and was exported to many other countries. The T-55 family was retired from the Russian army in 2012 with remaining vehicles sold off to other countries; variants of the tank remain in service with numerous countries.
