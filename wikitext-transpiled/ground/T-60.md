The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was a Soviet light tank, developed in late 1930s as a replacement for the amphibious T-38 scout tank. The team around designer Nicholas Astrov started designing the tank at Moscow Factory No. 37 in 1938 and two prototypes designated T-38A and T-38B were produced. The former was manufactured from 1940 as the T-40 light amphibious tank. The T-60 was considered a stop-gap tank after the German attack on Soviet Union, until the factories could produce enough T-34s and KV tanks. The T-60 used the chassis from the T-40 but gave up the ability to float for thicker armour protection. The T-60 was initially to be armed with a 12.7 mm DShK machine gun, but the army demanded stronger armament so a 20 mm TNSh cannon was chosen instead. The TNSh was a tank version of the aircraft ShVAK cannon and as such had very low penetration characteristics, being able to penetrate only 15 mm of armour at 500 m. Such gun characteristics were not enough to engage newer German up-armoured tanks, so the T-60 was moved into the role of an infantry support tank. The T-60 served as a base for an upgunned and uparmoured version which would later become the [[T-70]] tank. The T-60 served through the entire war and Romania modified 34 captured T-60s into their domestic TACAM T-60 tank destroyer.

The T-60 was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before Update 1.41. The T-60 features a long reload of 26 seconds once a belt is expended, paired with a quite mobile chassis with strong sloped frontal armour. The gun however, suffers from very poor ballistic properties and struggles to penetrate most opponents frontally, so flanking is advised while utilizing the T-60.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
[[File:T60 Screenshot 3.jpg|thumb|T-60 on "[[Frozen Pass (Ground Forces)|Frozen Pass]]"]]
The armour of the T-60 is fairly effective frontally, being for the most part angled gives it good protection against similarly rated opponents with a high chance of causing shots to ricochet, however a shot to the side will likely be fatal due to the thin (15 mm) side armour and the vehicle only having a 2 man crew, this means that the loss of 1 crew member will cause the vehicle to be knocked out.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=118|rbMinHp=67}}

The mobility of the T-60 is very comparable to the T-26, while it is fast enough to move around the map with ease, it is not mobile enough to be the first friendly to the cap or camping position, the mobility is enough to allow for a support or flanking role in most situations.

{{main|TNSh (20 mm)}}

The main armament of the T-60 is a 20 mm TNSh cannon, this has a fire rate of 750 rounds/min and will have to reload after 58 rounds have been fired, the gun is certainly effective against lightly armoured opponents but will have trouble against higher-rated heavy and medium tanks.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|FI|Fragmentation incendiary}} - The default belt is the most effective against aircraft because of the presence of 1/2 FI shells, which can make quick work of any aerial threats. Its performance against ground vehicles is however lessened by that.
* '''API:''' {{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}}- This belt fixes the default belt's problem against ground vehicles, and allows you to have AP-I shells only. However, this reduces performance against aircraft.
* '''API HV:''' {{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-I|Armour-piercing incendiary}}{{-}}{{Annotation|FI|Fragmentation incendiary}}- This belt could be considered the best out of the three, as it has improved AP-I shells with a couple more millimeters of penetration. Additionally, the 1/3  FI shell presence helps with air defense quite a bit, but doesn't worsen your damage against ground vehicles as much as the default belt does.

[[File:T-60 Screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|T-60 driving through "[[Eastern Europe (Ground Forces)|Eastern Europe]]" ]]
The T-60 is a fine little tank that excels in very particular situations; namely holding corners, flanking, and acting as a close range SPAA. This tank should never be used for long-range shooting or in pushes against an enemy head-on, one should always try to use its speed and manoeuvrability to gain an advantage before attacking. In a [[:Category:Anti-aircraft vehicles|SPAA]] role, the long reload time for this tank's main weapon can be a severe disadvantage. This means that one should use controlled bursts when attacking aeroplanes, making all shots count, and only picking large slow moving targets when at the range. The presence of a co-axial machine gun, however, not only adds to the firing density but allows for the tank to fire whilst the cannon is reloading. This machine gun has no utility against armoured targets. In this role, the T-60 is the only SPAA in this rank that does not have to fear 7.7 mm rounds (although 12.7 mm rounds can be very deadly - the [[M2A2]] is a very dangerous opponent, for instance). This means that T-60 pilots can be confident that they can survive being strafed by most fighter aircraft. In RB this tank serves as a perfectly capable replacement for the [[GAZ-AAA (4M)|4M GAZ-AAA]]. In conclusion, the T-60 is a versatile tank of good effectiveness that is a constant presence of any Rank I ground forces game. Its gun gives it easy penetration at the sides and some fronts of low-rank tanks.

This is a very versatile tank and that is its greatest strength. Its greatest weakness is it's horrible all around armour, always remember that you will probably not survive a single hit from an AT gun, and as such stay hidden and behind cover. In order to accomplish this use, this tanks great manoeuvrability to your advantage and try to hug cover and move in depressions of the landscape. When using this tank always attack from an unexpected angle then shot your entire belt and afterwards '''always re-position after an attack'''. A great strength of this tank is that at any point it can go from flanking an enemy tank to acting as a front line SPAA, and in many games this amazing ability that can save you and your comrades from certain death at the hands of an enemy bomber or attack plane.

===Development===
In 1938, a task to create an amphibious and non-amphibious scout tank was given to Nicholas Astrov's design team at Moscow Factory No. 37. The result was the T-30A and T-30B prototypes, with the A model being amphibious. The T-30A went on to become the T-40 amphibious scout tank, while the T-30B went on to become the '''T-60''' scout tank. Production started on July 1941, one month after the German invasion in Operation Barbarossa.

Originally with a 12.7 mm machine gun, the T-60 was up-gunned with a 20 mm TNSh cannon, which was derived from an aircraft cannon. The gun could penetrate 15 mm of armour at a 500 meters range, which proved very inadequate against the Germans [[Pz.III F|Panzer IIIs]] and [[Pz.IV F1|Panzer IVs]], which had a maximum of 50 mm of armour on the front. Not only that, the scout tank had poor mobility on cross-country terrain and had a maximum armour of only 20 mm thick. Despite that, the T-60 was easily produced and 6,292 of these tanks were produced between 1941 and 1942.

===Usage===
The low gun performance urged for an attempt to upgrade the tank with a 37 mm ZIS-19 cannon or the standard 45mm tank gun. Both of these projects were proven impossible. The T-60 served as a light tank up until the better [[T-70]] light tank was chosen as the new standard Soviet light tank in 1942, which had better armour and gun.

The T-60 went on in armour developmental projects for the Soviet forces, such as the designing of the T-90 anti-aircraft vehicle. But perhaps the most unique project that it played in was the ''Antonov A-40'', which was the Soviet's attempt on a "flying tank". The A-40 was a glider design that has wings attached to a lightened T-60 (removing its armament, ammunition, some accessories, and most of the fuel). On September 2, 1942, in a test, the prototype was towed by a [[TB-3M-17-32|TB-3 Bomber]] into the air. When released, the A-40 reportedly glided smoothly on its descent, despite the drag it put on the TB-3 plane. The A-40 landed safely and was able to drive back to the testing site after detaching the wings. The project was then abandoned due to the lack of enough aircraft with the power to tow the A-40 at 160 kilometres per hour speed.

The T-60 also were used by the Romanians when they captured 34 of them and modified them into the TACAM T-60 and Mareşal M05, both tank destroyers. All examples of these vehicles were confiscated by the Soviets after Romania switched to the Allies.

{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}
The T-60 light tank was developed in August, 1941 at Moscow Factory #37 under the management of N.A. Astrov. In September, 1941 the T-60 was accepted into the arsenal of the Red Army and was released serially in several automobile factories. The T-60 was produced until February, 1943, when it was replaced on assembly lines by the more powerful T-70 light tank. A total of 5,920 T-60s were produced, 1,366 of them in 1941. Most of them were built at the Gorky Factory.

Large numbers of T-60 tanks were used in battles from 1941 to 1943, starting with the Battle of Moscow and ending with the elimination of the Leningrad blockade in January, 1944. The T-60 was used actively throughout the Battle of Stalingrad and the Kharkov Operation. Due to significant losses, the T-60 was gradually removed from the front lines in late 1942.
