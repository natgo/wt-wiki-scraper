== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Russian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The T-72AV is a modernized version of the Soviet-made main battle tank T-72A. The CONTACT-1 ERA on the front of the turret is no longer directly mounted on it and is instead mounted on structural steel supports that form a slight arrow shape, it is also fitted with the TURMS-T fire control system.

'''Notes''':

* The {{PAGENAME}} uses two-piece ammunition, composed of propellant bags (orange) and projectiles (yellow). Both have separate racks.
* Shells are modelled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* A propellant charge remains in rack 2 after it is emptied and is later fired as part of rack 3. For the purpose of clarity, rack 2 is considered empty even if that charge is still present.
* Rack 4 (autoloader carrousel) is a first stage ammo rack containing 22 projectiles and 22 propellant charges.
** This rack gets filled first when loading up the tank and is also emptied first.
** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
** Once the autoloader magazine has been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader with at least one shell. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 3 into rack 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The T-72AV (TURMS-T) is a Russian MBT that is the mainstay in long-range engagements as the cannon is accurate at long distances. The recommended combat tactics is to acquire targets from afar with the thermal imager, use the laser rangefinder to achieve a successful hit and engage from the greatest possible distance. Avoid short-range combat at all costs.

While brawling in this tank is workable, it is not ideal. That said, the best way to engage in close-distance or urban fighting will be in a support role. Allow your teammates to push for positions, and help finish off any tanks with which they have trouble. Remember that this tank has an exceedingly slow reverse speed, so your defensive reactivity is very poor. It is best not to be caught off guard, as you will typically lose any 1 on 1 engagement in which you do not fire first.

'''Fighting in a top rank environment'''

If up-tiered to a top rank lineup match, remember that this tank is perfectly capable of destroying most of the enemies it will face. However, it is imperative that you aim for the usual weak spots on the enemy tanks. Most weak points that other Russian high-rank MBTs (such as the T-80U) rely on will still penetrate, even with the technically inferior top APFSDS round. The difference will primarily be in consistency of damage. {{PAGENAME}} players will find themselves firing more than one round into an enemy to reliably destroy them compared to just a single shot in a better, higher-rank tank.

Common headaches will include the likes of the Challanger, Leclerc, and Leopard 2A6 (as well as its derivatives), which will be exceedingly difficult to destroy frontally. In cases such as this, it is best to flank, or pick a different route to the battlefield, as the {{PAGENAME}}'s armour is far too thin to stop top-rank APFSDS rounds effectively. Put simply, the {{PAGENAME}} has an effective gun, average mobility, poor reactivity, and poor survivability. A new player will struggle while using this tank in a top-rank lineup.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has 2nd generation thermal sights for both the gunner and the commander
* Has a constant reload thanks to its autoloader
* Low profile, easy to hide
* ERA offers excellent protection against non-tandem ATGMS and HEAT rounds
* 3BM42 can penetrate most targets even at long range and in uptiers
* Has commander fire control, enabling the commander to return fire even if the gunner is killed
* Fuel tanks can absorb oncoming rounds

'''Cons:'''

* Kontakt-1 ERA offers no protection against kinetic rounds
* Only has 3 crew members
* Poor gun handling and gun depression; ill-suited to close range brawling and fighting on uneven terrain
* Very slow reverse speed
* Hull and turret armour can easily be penetrated by most rounds it faces especially in uptiers
* Sluggish mobility
* Slower reload compared to the opposition
* Does not have access to ATGMs
* Fight compartment is cramped likely to get one shotted

The T-72AV (TURMS-T) is a Soviet T-72AV tank modernized for the Syrian army. The TURMS fire control system, developed by the Italian company Officine Galileo, was previously used on C1 Ariete tanks. In the early 2000's, this fire control system was adopted for the T-72.

The system significantly improves the tank's vision capabilities, thanks to the commander's panoramic sight. It also features a high-quality thermal imaging gunner's sight, which allows the tank to effectively perform combat missions at night and in poor visibility conditions. By 2006, 122 TURMS kits were produced for the Syrian army.
