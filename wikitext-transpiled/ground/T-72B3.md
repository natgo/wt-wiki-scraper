== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''T-72B3 (Object 184M-3)''' is an up-gunned and armoured modification of the [[T-72B]], which is the third variant of the [[T-72 (Family)|T-72 main battle tank family]]. To simplify supply lines, old stocks of T-72B variants held in reserve were upgraded with components used in the new T-90 main battle tank family in 2010. The modernisation program (as the '''T-72B3M'''; post-2016 production) focuses primarily on the implementation of a new fire control system, in addition to performing an extensive upgrade on every tank, such as more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in the driver's compartment, and new universal, twin-pin tracks. While the tank commander's sight retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, the gunner's sight now has access to thermal imaging equipment as well as the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which is a multi-channel, panoramic sight with a built-in laser rangefinder.

Introduced in [[Update "Raining Fire"]], the T-72B3 provides players with cutting-edge technology. With the much-needed thermal imaging equipment for the gunner's sight, players will be able to easily spot enemies from a distance. While all of these improvements do not eliminate its main flaw, which is the extremely slow reverse speed, they do make this tank one of the most powerful members of the T-72 main battle tank family to date. Players will be pleased to have this tank at their disposal, as it will undoubtedly perform well in battle.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
[[File:T-72B3_weak_spots.png|400px|thumb|right|Vulnerable areas of the T-72B3's frontal profile. The gunner's sight is a risky shot as it has a chance of ricocheting.]]
Overall, the armour protection of the T-72B3 can be considered almost the same as in the [[T-90A]] and [[T-80U]]. The T-72B3, similar to the [[T-72B (1989)]] and T-90A, has access to the Kontakt-5 ERA. This ERA (different from Relict and Kontakt-1 seen in other T-72B series) has the particularity that it has stopping power against APFSDS (similar to Dorchester). Different from other T-72s and T-90A, this tank also gets access to the multi-layer Relict ERA in the side-skirts and slat armour (cage) on the engine deck sides and rear. Fuel tanks on either side of the driver can soak up some shrapnel and add to the overall survivability although they are most likely to be lit on fire if hit with HEAT-FS or an ATGM. However, as with all Russian autoloaded MBTs, there are only three crew members so a well-placed shot is capable of causing a crew knock-out. Despite having a carousel autoloader which is not protected by any blast shield like on the [[Leclerc]] and [[Type 90]] MBTs, it is harder to ammo rack compared to the T-80s especially since the ammo is scattered horizontally on top of each other ("=" in this shape) and not in an L shape (in which charges are vertical and projectiles are horizontal). This reduces the chances of ammo rack compared to the T-80s. However, all side shots on the hull will be lethal regardless of the carousel as said shot will take out two crew members. The ERA offers really good protection against chemical energy penetrators such as HEAT-FS, ATGMs, and anti-tank grenades, having a protection of 420 mm against chemical energy and 120 mm against kinetic energy. This makes the tank capable of withstanding hits of all HEAT-FS of the BR (most of them penetrate between 320 mm to 480 mm) and ATGMs (between 400 mm to 1,000 mm). It should be noted that ERA itself cannot stop all the spalling created by the premature explosion, the armour plating is what stops the spalling in case the ATGM has more penetration than what the ERA can withstand.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,302|rbMinHp=743|abMaxHp=2,156|rbMaxHp=1,130|AoAweight=1}}

The T-72B3 has the same mobility and manoeuvrability as past T-72B series with its V-84 engine. However, once the UBH package is installed, it has greater mobility compared to previous T-72 series tanks as it has an increase in horsepower thanks to the V-92S2F engine. Compared to its more expensive and gas turbine-equipped counterpart, the T-80U, the T-72B3 has worse mobility and manoeuvrability even with the UBH package. The T-72B3 has mediocre speed and overall mobility compared to NATO tanks which is compensated with armour and low profile. With its powerful engine, the T-72B3 is able to pull and push enemy tanks with ease (winching them is recommended to activate the tank corpse track movement as they will not move if no cable is attached)

{{main|2A46M-5 (125 mm)}}

The T-72B3 has access to the 2A46M-5 125 mm smoothbore main gun. This gun is nothing new in the Russian MBT tree and fires the same ammunition as seen in previous models (darts vary from the T-72A to the rest of the T-72 and T-90 tanks). This can be considered as a pro as all rounds have same handling between series. As all T-72Bs, they are able to fire the 9M119 ATGM from the main gun. However, the T-72B3 has access to the 9M119M1, a modernized 9M119 with a tandem charge but slightly reduced flight speed. The 2E58 gun control system was also adopted, which greatly boosts the gun traverse speed to a whopping 40° in both horizontal and vertical directions.

==== Ammunition ====
The T-72B3 has access to the same ammunition shown in previous T-72Bs. All are capable rounds which are not new and have same handling.

''HEAT-FS:''

The 3BK18M is the first round the T-72B3, as the previous T-72Bs, has access to, it can be considered a mediocre round as most of the enemies which will be faced will be able to withstand it due to composite armour. However, it is particularly useful when facing light armoured vehicles which are prompt to overpressure (SPAA, light tanks, etc) and useful when facing enemy helicopters as it has enough explosive mass and flight speed to be competitive as a last resort. As a hollow charge, it is prompt to detonate mid-air due to trees, bushes and fences. This makes the round difficult to use when in long range engagements as some field elements (forage, objects, etc.) may not be rendered and the round's velocity make aiming harder.

''APFSDS:''

The T-72B3 has access to 2 types of APFSDS: the 3BM42 and 3BM60. The 3BM42 is a decent round with decent penetration and stopping power. While it lacks penetration to penetrate Leopard 2 tanks upper frontal plate, Leclerc's lower frontal plate or M1A1/2 turret plates, it has enough penetration to hit and cause critical damage in weakspots and side shots. 3BM60 however, has much more penetration which can penetrate all tanks from all sides.

''ATGM:''

The 9M119M1 is a tandem version of the previously seen 9M119 SACLOS ATGM in past T-72s. The main upgrade is the tandem charge, everything else remains practically the same with exception of reduction of flight speed.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->As one of the most-produced MBT in Russia, T-72B series received extensive upgrades throughout the 21st century; which T-72B3 inherited the protection of post-1989 models with Kontakt-5 ERA blocks on both the chassis and turret, making its performance identical to its 10.0 counterpart. After T-72B3M (UBH modification) upgrades in 2016, players will find the tank very similar to the flying fortress from Leningrad/Omsk - [[T-80BVM]] with 4S24 "soft-case" ERA packs on the sides, as well as rear fences around the engine bay. While it lacks the mobility of T-80 series, the overall protection will still prove useful at top-tier battles with careful planning.

==== As T-72B3 ====
The most obvious difference between Mod. 1989 and post-2012 modification is the addition of the new Sosna-U TVD camera and the lack of IR searchlight, as well as the new Kord (6P49) for the commander. Although the Sosna-U does look like CITV, but it is in fact part of the new gunner system and only serve as the TVD for both the gunner and commander (with separated monitor); if players do have the need to override the turret, the only thing they can rely on is the traditional periscope only with NVD channel and fixed 5x magnification, which can be major problem when entering night battle. Other than that, T-72B3 is mostly similar to T-72B Mod. 1989 at 10.0 other than the new gunner system. If T-72B Mod. 1989 is monstrous for its great protection at 10.0, then T-72B3 can be said as the complete opposite at 11.3; due to the identical protection from a 10.0 tank, MBTs at its tier with APFSDS more than 600 mm penetration will have greater odds to penetrate T-72B3 at close distance. The inferior mobility also hinders the flexibility of the tank as it is much lower than any MBTs of its era at only 840 hp (NATO/US-Allied countries and PLAGF are already at >1200 hp), at such, T-72B3 will not be the first one to hit the frontline; leaving more of a second-line MBT for the time being. Be sure to utilize covers from time to time and plan any assaults ahead as the gun traverse is still inferior for this model; with upgraded APFSDS and ATGMs of its era, it can still make sure most NATO MBTs will have a bad day once being penetrated (aside from Strv 122 series and ZTZ99 series) while HEFS can make sure overpressure kills on tanks with exposed CITV or light vehicles.

==== As T-72B3 UBH ====
After the UBH upgrades in 2016, the T-72B3M, actually received upgrades during the upgrades of 2016 with revised 2E58 gun control system which further boosted the previously inferior gun laying motors on both direction (now at up to 40°), giving it much needed reaction time than previous models. The protection is also upgraded with new Relikt ERA based on Kontakt-5 on the UFP (identical to T-80BVM), side 4S24 "soft-case" ERA packs with some extend of kinetic protection, as well as rear side fences to protect from chemical shells; finally, the much anticipated mobility upgrade brings the V-92S2F with an sub-par 1130 hp output, although it will not change the inferior reverse speed by any means, this gives way more acceleration when going forward and flanking enemies can be a viable option if needed. It can be say that the base model and upgraded T-72B3 is completely different tank especially on the overall handling. The UBH can now keeps up with the main force for an assault while the new ammunitions can maintain its efficiency to terminate enemies' career; making T-72B3 UBH a much tougher target to be dealt with.

Overall, with careful planning during assault and be extra careful before upgrade can further enhance the efficiency of T-72B3; while the upgraded tank can serve as a backup to T-80BVM with lesser mobility.  

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

* [[M1A1 HC]]/[[M1A1 AIM]]/[[M1A2 Abrams|M1A2]]/[[M1A2 SEP]] Abrams: Turret frontal plates are very strong, unless angled within 45° and using 3BM60.
* [[Leopard 2A5]]/[[Leopard 2A6]]/[[Leopard 2A6 (Sweden)]]: UFP and turret frontal plates can only be penetrated by 3BM60. Turret wedges should be blown out first in order to penetrate the turret frontal plate.
* [[Strv 122A]]/[[Strv 122B PLSS]]: UFP impenetrable by 3BM42 unless MEXAS armour package is destroyed. Turret wedges should be blown out first in order to penetrate the turret frontal plate.
* [[Leclerc]]/[[Leclerc S2]]/[[Leclerc SXXI]]: OFL 120 F1 has enough armour penetration to penetrate T-72B3's frontal plates even after the ERA effect, though they can also destroyed with any of the available munitions in return.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Has access to 2nd generation thermals for the gunner
* Decent side armour with the UBH package, the 4S22 and 4S24 ERA can stop HEAT rounds and ATGMs from the side.  
** UBH package also upgrades the engine for better mobility 
* Decent turret protection, made even better with the UBH upgrade
* Good selection of shells, including APFSDS, HEAT-FS, HE, and Tandem ATGMs
* Autoloader carousel is located lower on the hull, making it difficult to hit from distance
* Excellent gun handling

'''Cons:'''

* High risk of ammo rack detonation
* Obvious weak spot on the right side of the turret face without the UBH upgrade (where the IR searchlight used to be on the T-72B 1989)
* Small size means crew is packed tightly together, an penetrating shell often takes it out in one shot.
* Turret ring and gun mantlet are still the biggest weak spots
* Slow reverse speed
* Stock mobility is a huge disadvantage when facing other top tier tanks, speed tops at around 35 km/h in rough terrain, although it improves massively when fully upgraded
* Hull armor and ERA might not be able to stand up to top APFSDS rounds up close
* Rather slow reload

The T-72B3 is the latest modification to the T-72B family. It was a 2011 modification of reserved T-72s which made a complete overhaul to set them on par with the T-90A, T-90S and T-90M MBTs. It featured a change of universal standard double-pin tracks for easier maintenance. It got a heavy increase in firepower which put it at par with the T-90s quickly. It got the Kalina fire control system, kept the past 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 Neman ATGM guidance sight and received the PNM Sosna-U GPS. The autoloader, as the T-90's, was modified to fit longer, more modern ammunition, {{Annotation|3VBM19|3BM44M + 3BM42M Lekalo projectiles}}, {{Annotation|3VBM20|3BM46 Svinets}}, {{Annotation|3VBM22|3BM59 Svinets-1}} and {{Annotation|3VBM23|3BM60 Svinets-2}}. With the {{Annotation|UBKh|Improved Battle Characteristics}} package installed, the vehicle is brought up to the T-72B3M obr. 2016g. standard. The 840hp V-84-1 engine is replaced with the 1100hp V-92S2F, a 2E58 stabilizer with electromechanical drive is fitted, Relikt ERA was fitted on the hull alongside soft-bag ERA on the turret, slat armor to protect against rocket propelled grenades, the main gun is replaced with the 2A46M-5-01, and a 6P49 Kord-T is installed in a RCWS.
