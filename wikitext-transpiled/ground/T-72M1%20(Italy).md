== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' represents the 178 T-72M1s delivered to Hungary by the Soviet Union. Having been delivered in 1979, the tank did not see combat during its service with Hungary. Due to becoming obsolete and the shift towards NATO technology in the Hungarian Armed Forces, these tanks were put into reserve while the Leopard 2 series replaces them during the 2020s. Some of these T-72M1s are supplied to countries that need to replenish their tank fleet of Soviet-built tanks.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as part of the Hungarian branch of the Italian tech tree. While it has some weaknesses such as gun traverse and speed, the T-72M1 can still serve as a breakthrough tank if utilized carefully where lower tier tanks will have a hard time fighting back.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The T-72M1 is basically a near identical copy of the [[T-72A]] found in the Soviet tech tree, therefore the armour layout is also almost identical. Some differences are the additional applique armour placed on the front glacis which was part of the mid-1980s upgrade. While not substantially thick, the sloping effect on top of the composite front glacis might be enough to prevent some shells from fully penetrating, especially those from lower tiers; they will have extremely hard time going through the armour.

The hull and turret of the T-72M1 are strong enough to somewhat reliably bounce some shells and eat, although it still possesses the same weak spots that most other soviet tanks have (lower front plate, drivers optics, etc.).

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
V-46-6 12-cylinder diesel engine is still the only option for T-72A series and the export T-72M1; while the overall power-to-weight ratio is better than M60 series and Chieftain series, French, Italian and German tanks will always outrun T-72 thanks to their high output engine. But the long-time problem of -4 km/h reverse speed still haunts the tank, making it very unlikely to retreat for safety without turning the tank (if smoke grenades available).

{{main|2A46M (125 mm)}}

Like all T-72A series in game, T-72M1 uses the standard 2A46M 125 mm smoothbore cannon as the older D-81T on T-64A or T-72 Ural couldn't fulfill the combat needs of 1970s; the gun is known for its devastating firepower against enemy vehicles with varieties of ammunition of HEATFS, HEFS and APFSDS. While a precise hit on enemy components is very likely to disable them or knock them out right away, players will need to pay extra attention on its rather inferior turret traverse speed and make every shot count as the 7.1 second fixed reload time can be a dual-edge sword - while losing a crew in the tank will not halt the autoloader, aced tank crews can reload at least a second faster than autoloader does.

The T-72 series is widely known for being an economical yet effective option for large-scale tank assaults. The T-72M1 in Hungary service is no exception, sharing many characteristics with its Soviet counterparts. Its armour and firepower are superior to most enemies it might encounter, but there are some persistent flaws in this tank series that players should be aware of.

The T-72M1 is mostly identical to the T-72A Mod. 1983 in Soviet service, featuring the smoke launchers and extra layer of applique armour on the upper front plate (UFP) that provides additional protection against most tanks at its tier. The installation of the later 2A46M 125 mm gun also ensures that it can take on enemy targets at its tier with ease, as most tanks at its tier would be one-shot by its devastating ammunition. Players who are familiar with the Soviet tech tree will quickly become accustomed to the T-72M1's similar performance to the T-72A. Those who are using it as an alternative to Bundeswehr MBTs, however, will need to adjust their tactics to maximize its effectiveness against potential enemies. While the T-72M1 lacks the high top speed of tanks like the Leopard series (barely reaching 59 km/h, similar to PLAGF tanks), it has the firepower to obliterate enemies from a distance thanks to its laser rangefinder (LRF) and larger calibre gun. The high muzzle velocity of its APFSDS shell ensures that it lands on designated targets accurately, while its HE-FS shell can sometimes result in surprise kills on enemy MBTs with overpressure damage, not to mention light vehicles with minimal protection. Players should note, however, that the T-72M1's slow turret traverse speed and fixed magnification gunsight can make sniping a challenge. In the event of a more aggressive approach, the T-72M1's protection and firepower make it capable of breaking through defensive lines composed of lower-tier tanks. Players should take cover as soon as possible after a large-scale counterattack, however, as the tank is not capable of rapid shots on enemies. Delaying counterattacks and waiting for support is the best strategy.

A common issue that haunts the T-72 series is the gun traverse speed, as previously mentioned. Chances are that enemies will take to the flanks to hit the tank's sides instead, which will result in the most devastating blow it could suffer - the cramped AZ-172 autoloader is completely exposed to enemy shells, and a precise hit on it could trigger a "jack-in-the-box" effect, sending the turret flying hundreds of metres away from the hull. Therefore, players should never show the sides to enemies and should plan their assaults carefully. Directing the tank straight towards the enemies is the best way to increase the odds of survival. The well-known driver visor and LFP weakspot are still vulnerabilities of the T-72M1, but shells will often encounter areas well-protected with the applique armour. Players should avoid giving enemies the opportunity to take aim at these spots.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Devastating firepower with varieties of ammunition ranging from HEFS to APFSDS
* Well-protected against earlier APFSDS with insufficient penetration
* Autoloader ensures constant reload time with no worries about knocked-out crew
* Low profile for concealment behind bushes or cover
* Better mobility than some NATO tanks (i.e. [[M60 (Family)|M60 series]] and [[Chieftain (Family)|Chieftains]])
* NSVT for gunning down light targets or aircraft

'''Cons:'''

* Inferior optics with fixed magnification, no TVD channel
* Lacks commander override, gunner down means a very likely death sentence
* Identical weak spots to other [[T-72A]] series (i.e. driver visors, mantlet)
* Cramped interior space with a high likelihood of a fatal blow once penetrated
* Infamous AZ-172 autoloader with very high likelihood of detonation once hit
* Less agile than French, German or Italian tanks with their higher top speeds and better transmissions
* Infamous -4 km/h reverse speed means having to reverse after making a mistake can be fatal

178 T-72M1s were delivered to Hungary from 1979 to 1987; these were likely licensed production versions from Poland or Czechoslovakia as recorded on SIPRI. They served in the Hungarian Army from Hungary's time in the Warsaw Pact to the time after they joined NATO and are now being gradually replaced by Leopard 2 tanks. Most of these T-72M1s were put into reserve, while some of these vehicles were donated to different countries that needed Warsaw Pact tanks.
