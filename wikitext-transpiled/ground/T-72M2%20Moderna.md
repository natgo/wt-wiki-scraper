== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Wind of Change"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7640-event-the-battle-for-arachis-en|"Battle for Arachis"]] event.

The modernization of ex-Czechoslovakian license-built T-72M1 tanks with French thermal gun sights, new ERA packages, and new APFSDS, as well as an additional 30 mm autocannon for self-defence, the T-72M2 Moderna introduces Slovakia into the game with respectable firepower and overall higher mobility.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Although it is named T-72M2, which might sound more advanced, the base model is still a T-72M which shares the same chassis as the stock [[T-72A]]. However, he M2 modification adds layers of DYNAS ERA blocks on UFP and turret front, each block can provide additional protection against up to 100 mm of kinetic penetration, making the T-72M2 tougher to be destroyed. While it might not be enough at higher tiers with an abundance of APFSDS shells which can go up to 500 mm penetration, the protection is enough to stop most tanks which have been up-tiered at longer ranges and the turret can stop up to 700 mm from kinetic penetrators.

But once again, this is still a T-72 series with a compact interior and the same AZ-172 autoloader; like any T-72 series tank, a solid penetration from enemy projectiles will very likely set it ablaze (sometimes even fuel explosion) or detonate the ammunition, launching the turret sky-high, so players need to pay extra caution to enemies just like other T-72s do.

{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1317|rbMinHp=752}}

Like later T-72s, the T-72M2 has its engine upgraded to a Polish PZL Wola S12U diesel engine with 850 hp output, which is a bit higher than T-72B's V-84S with 840 hp, though still the highest of the A and M series T-72s. The T-72M2 shares the same top speed of 60 km/h and infamous -4.2 km/h reverse speed, as well as the 44.5 ton weight of the later T-72B. Although 10 hp difference is not too much, the overall mobility is still worse than NATO counterparts.

'''Notes''':

* The {{PAGENAME}} uses two-piece ammunition, composed of propellant bags (orange) and projectiles (yellow). Both have separate racks.
* Shells are modelled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* A propellant charge remains in rack 2 after it is emptied and is later fired as part of rack 3. For the purpose of clarity, rack 2 is considered empty even if that charge is still present.
* Rack 4 (autoloader carrousel) is a first stage ammo rack containing 22 projectiles and 22 propellant charges.
** This rack gets filled first when loading up the tank and is also emptied first.
** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.
** Once the autoloader magazine has been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader with at least one shell. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 3 into rack 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.

=== Additional armament ===

{{main|2A42 (30 mm)}}

A very distinctive feature of the T-72M2 is the 2A42 30 mm autocannon mounted on the right side of the turret. The gun is highly destructive against light vehicles, low-flying aircraft, and vehicles showing their sides; alternatively, it can also be used to knock out enemies' barrels. It is considered as a "machine gun" and is operated by the vehicle gunner, sharing the same optics and thermals as the main gun.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The T-72M2 Moderna excels in mid- to long-range engagements with its powerful and accurate 125mm cannon. The recommended tactic is similar to most other Russian MBTs at this BR: find targets at range using the thermal sights, then use the laser rangefinder and well-endowed APFSDS or HEATFS projectiles to knock out the target from as far away from your vehicle as possible.

When forced into close-range combat, this vehicle is very mediocre compared to NATO vehicles with its painful reverse speed, lack of neutral steering, and subpar turret traverse. However, the liberal application of ERA, slat armour, and the underlying composite armour can sometimes save you from smaller-calibre or poorly-aimed shells. IFVs in particular, even ones with high-penetrating APFSDS like the [[M3A3 Bradley]] and [[Strf 9040C]], will be almost helpless against the frontal protection of a Moderna.

This vehicle will feel very reminiscent of the [[T-72AV (TURMS-T)]] with its almost identical gun and armour performance.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* DYNAS ERA provides up to 100 mm of kinetic protection 
* Has access 2nd generation thermals for both the gunner and commander, which are also only a Tier II modification
* Powerful 30 mm autocannon tears through light vehicles and aircraft and is operated by the gunner
* Has commander fire control
* Good situational awareness thanks to LWS
* TAPNA APFSDS provides greater penetrative capabilities against enemies, even better than the 3BM42 Mango used by its Russian contemporaries
* Launches 11 smoke grenades per charge (11/22)

'''Cons:'''

* Poor turret traverse and gun handling
* * Somewhat sluggish with a horrible reverse speed
* Fixed 8x gunsight make engagements a struggle
* Hull and turret armour can easily be penetrated by most rounds it faces especially in uptiers
* 30 mm autocannon has no traverse of its own, can only move vertically
* Does not have access to ATGMs

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The T-72M2 Moderna is a licensed-produced Slovakian upgrade of the Soviet T-72 MBT. Among the various upgrades, the tank is fitted with DYNAS explosive reactive armour, a modernized 24A5MS 125 mm smoothbore gun, a single 30 mm 2A42 autocannon, a laser warning system, and an automated modern VEGA fire control system, originating from SFIM, a French development partner, and SABCA, a Belgian development partner.<ref name=":0">https://www.military-today.com/tanks/t72m2_moderna.htm</ref>

The first prototype of the T-72M2 Moderna, an improvement on the T-72M1 prototype, was introduced in 1993. Although attempts were made to put the T-72M2 Moderna into production domestically and for export buyers, no production orders were ever placed, therefore, few functioning examples were produced.<ref name=":0" />

=== [[wt:en/news/7639-development-battle-for-arachis-t-72m2-moderna-en|Devblog]] ===
After the division of Czechoslovakia followed by an economic crisis, Slovak tank builders found themselves on the brink of bankruptcy. Tank plant ZTS Dubnica initiated an upgrade project for the Soviet T-72 series MBT in order to make the tank interesting for both domestic and foreign operators. By 1993, together with the French company SFIM and the Belgian SABCA, a project was developed to modernize the T-72M1 tanks with a new VEGA fire control system, a new panoramic sight, an improved engine, domestic ERA protection and two gunpods with 20 mm KAA-200 guns on the turret's sides.

The built prototypes of the new main battle tank were designated T-72M2 Moderna. Later, the tank was equipped by a new DYNAS explosive reactive armour, and two 20 mm guns were replaced with one 30 mm 2A42 cannon. Only a few prototypes of the T-72M2 Moderna were built.
