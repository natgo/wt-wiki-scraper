== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Russian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Red Skies"]].

The T-80BVM is a significantly upgraded [[T-80B]]. Although the T-80B is an older variant than the previous [[T-80U]], this upgrade package is more than enough to bring it to par. Distinctive arrays of third-generation "Relikt" ERA offer high protection against both chemical and kinetic rounds, the gun can now fire top-notch 3BM60 "Svinets" APFSDS and 9M119M1 "Refleks" ATGMs with improved handling, and the engine has been upgraded to the T-80U's 1250 horsepower. The T-80BVM once again achieves a triple threat of high protection, firepower, and mobility on top of a low profile, making it an excellent capstone for the T-64/T-80 line.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The armour protection of the T-80BVM is one of the best, especially if the incoming round hits one of the Relikt ERA plates which are twice as effective as CONTACT-5 ERA against kinetic projectiles (meaning that the Leopard 2A6, one of the most dangerous opponents, cannot easily penetrate the UFP). The strongest parts of the tank are the turret front and a majority of the upper front plate. It does, however, have some weaker areas, the most important being the driver's hatch, the immediate areas of the turret surrounding the gun and its breech, and its lower frontal plate. These weak spots are however pretty small targets at range, and thus by hiding them properly, the risk of being hit can be minimized. Owing to its very low profile, a hull-down T-80BVM is a small target in itself; the weaker parts of its armour are even smaller.

Fuel tanks on either side of the driver can soak up some shrapnel and add to the overall survivability. However, as with all Russian auto-loaded MBTs, there are only three crew members so a well-placed shot is capable of causing a crew knock-out. It's also worth noting that the placement of the ammo rack, below the turret in a carousel-style setup, leaves the T-80BVM particularly vulnerable to side shots causing ammunition detonation. The protection of the T-80BVM is very similar to the T-80U in terms of the size and placement of the weak areas. The sides of your tank should always be protected, and when engaging an enemy, your front armour should always be aligned directly towards him to reduce the risks of a shot tearing through your weaker side. The tank does, however, have some Relikt ERA plates on its upper front skirts, meaning that you have some extra protection against KE penetrators, and a lot against chemical shells, until the ERA bricks are detonated (leaving the area vulnerable for another hit).

As mentioned above, the T-80BVM also benefits from the typical low silhouette Russian tankers will be accustomed to, with the vehicle being significantly smaller than its competitors. This allows the T-80BVM to be hidden behind small terrain deformities which other MBTs would otherwise be visible. It's also harder for an enemy tank commander to immediately tell which area is the most vulnerable.

'''Armour type:'''

- Cast homogeneous armour (turret, cupola, gun mantlet)
- Rolled homogeneous armour (gunner hatch)
- High-hardness rolled armour (hull)
- Rubber-fabric (mudguards)
- Alloy BT-6 (engine roof)

{{main|2A46M-1 (125 mm)}}
The T-80BVM has access to the 2A46M-1 125 mm smoothbore main gun. This gun fires the same ammunition as the previous [[T-64 (Family)|T-64]] and [[T-80 (Family)|T-80]] models but with new projectiles such as the 3BM60 "Svinets-2" APFSDS round and the 9M119M1 "Invar-M" ATGM, a modernized 9M119 "Svir" with a tandem charge and a slightly reduced speed. The T-80BVM has excellent gun handling on par with tanks such as the [[M1A2 Abrams|M1A2]] and [[Leopard 2A6]]. It also has a steady reload rate at 6.5 seconds.

==== Ammunition ====
The T-80BVM has access to capable rounds, able to destroy any enemy tank or vehicle it faces at the battle rating. Its most notable round is the powerful 3BM60 "Svinets-2" APFSDS.

'''3BK18M''', HEAT-FS - The 3BK18M is one of the first rounds the T-80BVM has access to, it can be considered a mediocre round for close to medium range as most of the enemies which will be faced will be able to withstand it due to composite armour. However, it is particularly useful when facing light armoured vehicles which are prompt to overpressure (SPAA, light tanks, etc) and useful when facing enemy helicopters as it has enough explosive mass and flight speed to be competitive as last resort. As a hollow charge, it is prompt to detonate mid air due to trees, bushes and fences. This makes the round difficult to use when in long range engagements as some field elements (forage, objects, etc.) may not be rendered and the round's velocity make aiming harder.

'''3OF26''', HE-FS - A familiar and useful stock round of 125 mm gun, the 3OF26 pack big amount of explosive filler that can kill light vehicles and overpressure hull down MBT with precision shots. As a high explosive, it is prompt to detonate mid air due to trees, bushes and fences. Its suitable for close range combat and terrain with less trees and bushes.

'''3BM42, 3BM60''', APFSDS - The T-80BVM has access to 2 types of APFSDS: the 3BM42 and 3BM60. The 3BM42 is a decent round with decent penetration and stopping power. While it lacks penetration to penetrate Leopard 2 tanks, Leclercs or M1A1/2 turret plates, it has enough penetration to hit and cause critical damage in weak spots and side shots. The 3BM60 however, different from the 3BM42, has much more penetration which can penetrate all tanks from all sides (be aware of Leopard 2 turret wedges and firing at M1A2 turret with an obliquity greater than 45°).

'''9M119M1''', ATGM (tandem) - The 9M119M1 is a tandem version of the previously seen 9M119 ATGM. The main upgrade is the tandem charge, everything else remains practically the same with exception of reduction of flight speed.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->

{{main|NSVT (12.7 mm)|PKT (7.62 mm)}}
The 12.7 mm NSVT machine gun, seen on all previous Soviet MBTs, can help take out some lightly armoured vehicles from the side as well as to destroy low-flying aircraft and helicopters.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The T-80BVM has a higher protection and better ammunition than the T-80U, meaning it is able to hold much more fire and deal more damage with the Svinets APFSDS than with the Mango APFSDS. The most dangerous enemy to the T-80BVM is helicopters, although the Relikt will usually protect against one or two missiles. However, it is still ERA, and will be blown off after it is detonated. Since the interior of the tank is so compact, this makes it easy for good pilots to knock you out in 2-3 rapid missile shots. To avoid helicopters, stay close to buildings or hide next to trees/large bushes and wait for an anti-air vehicle or a plane to take it out. Or use the ATGM or rangefinder to shoot down the enemy yourself.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Equipped with composite armour and Relikt ERA, protection and survivability is superb from the front, especially against HEAT rounds and when hull down
- UBH upgrade enables increased side protection on the hull and turret
- Access to the powerful 3BM60 APFSDS shell
- Autoloader grants a short and constant reload time
- Most of the rounds are placed in the autoloader which helps the tank stay in active combat longer
- Good mobility
- Good gun handling
- Has 3rd generation thermal sights for the gunner

'''Cons:'''

- While the front is covered with ERA plates, gaps between plates present small weak spots
- A tightly packed crew in a cramped interior means low survivability in case of a successful penetration
- Poor gun depression of -5° due to the low turret height, making it difficult to perform well in hilly terrain
- High risk of ammo rack detonation due to the vertical orientation of propellant charges in the carousel
- Relatively low reverse speed, hard to fall back when flanked or damaged
- Base turret armor can easily be penetrated by the APFSDS rounds it encounters

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The T-80BVM is a current program for the Russian army in the modernization of Soviet T-80BV tanks to the level of the T-72B3 and T-90M main battle tanks, as well as unification with them. The modernization includes an up-to-date fire control system with a duplicate sight for the commander, and the ability to operate the 9M119 tandem ATGMs, as well as the "Relikt" ERA pack instead of outdated "Kontakt-1". Thanks to the latter, the protection of the vehicle from HEAT and AP projectiles was significantly increased.

The modernization of the T-80BVM takes place at the facilities of the Omsk heavy machinery plant (Omsktransmash) and enter service with units of the marines and motorized infantry of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
