== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Addition of Knotakt-5 ERA on the turret cheeks and UFP allows it to withstand most contemporary APFSDS rounds and HEAT rounds found in its current BR. Typical Russian MBT weakspots still apply; LFP, driver's viewport, etc. Fuel tanks are prone to exploding when hit. The small number of crew (3 crew members) drastically reduces the tank's survivability as a shot through the driver's viewport is likely to knock out the driver and one turret crew. The autoloader is located right underneath the turret crew and ammo detonation is very likely when a round penetrates. Side armour is negligible with small pockets of Kontakt-5 near the front offering protection against weaker HEAT rounds and miniscule protection against kinetic rounds.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->
