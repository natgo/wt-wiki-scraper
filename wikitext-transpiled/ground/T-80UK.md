== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a squadron rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

[[File:Kontact - 5 on T-80UK.png|thumb|350px|Kontakt-5 ERA on T-80UK]]
The hull armour on the T-80UK is a 5-layer armour, which is comprised of 50 mm high-hardness rolled armour, 30 mm of textolite, 50 mm of high-hardness rolled armour, 30 mm textolite, and 50 mm of high-hardness rolled armour. On top of this armour array, there is another form of protection which is Kontakt-5, a second generation explosive reactive armour. The turret armour on the T-80UK is also covered by Kontakt-5 on the front of the turret.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The T-80UK is a command variant of the T-80U. As such, the playstyle will not change much. The most notable difference between the two tanks is the soft-kill active protection system, which will disrupt the guidance of any ATGMs headed in the direction of the tank, provided the turret is facing the launching vehicle.

While the armour is reasonably good, it will fail to stop some APFSDS rounds, so it is important that you refrain from relying on it. Remember that the armour is not meant to protect the tank, it is meant to protect the crew. With that said, you'll find yourself absorbing a significant portion of poorly-placed or rushed shots in your direction, provided they are not from the side or rear. It is also important to remember, the ERA is expendable. Once it is gone, your tank will be left with significant weak spots that can, and will be abused by your enemies. It is best not to get hit in the first place.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Soft kill passive protection system
* Overall good frontal armour
* Good mobility
* Effective ERA, capable of stopping many of the APFSDS rounds you'll face

'''Cons:'''

* Autoloader carousel is a significant vulnerability
* The vehicle is loud, effectively removing any sense of stealth
* Rather slow turret traverse and reverse speed significantly reduce reactivity
* Subpar gun depression

== History ==

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.
