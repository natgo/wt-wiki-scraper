== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the evaluation prototype of a commander tank version of the T-80U tested in the 1980s. The design of T-80UK was mostly similar to the T-80U, but upgraded with TVD, Shtora-1 soft-kill APS, new FCS, and communication equipment. The vehicle was evaluated and passed state certification in the 1990s, but the certified T-80UK in Russian Army service did not install Shtora-1 APS, likely a result of funding problems during production and saving equipment for more advanced tanks like the T-90. The only prototype is mostly used during army exhibitions or army open days.

The T-80UK was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]] as the tier VII squadron vehicle of Soviet ground tech-tree. Aside from the sensors and IR jammers for the Shtora-1 soft-kill APS, as well as the HE-TF version of the infamous 3OF26, the overall performance of the T-80UK is identical to its tech-tree predecessor, giving players sufficient protection at its tier while boasting a wide variety of ammunition to take down enemy vehicles. However, players will need to make every shot count, as the tank doesn't have the best APFSDS at its tier (particularly against tough foes with protected UFPs like the ZTZ99), as well as the inferior gun handling on Soviet tanks (pre-2016 Russian MBTs).

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

[[File:Kontact - 5 on T-80UK.png|thumb|350px|Kontakt-5 ERA on T-80UK]]
The hull armour on the T-80UK is a 5-layer armour, which is comprised of 50 mm high-hardness rolled armour, 30 mm of textolite, 50 mm of high-hardness rolled armour, 30 mm textolite, and 50 mm of high-hardness rolled armour. On top of this armour array, there is another form of protection which is Kontakt-5, a second generation explosive reactive armour. The turret armour on the T-80UK is also covered by Kontakt-5 on the front of the turret.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,937|rbMinHp=1,106}}

T-80UK didn't include any changes on mobility and the overall upgrades for the prototype have negligible impact on the weight of vehicle, therefore the good old Klimov GTD-1250 gas turbine can still push the tank to up to 70 km/h. However, caution is advised when pushing, as the tank doesn't have the best reverse speed; while -12 km/h is one of the best among Soviet/Russian MBTs, this is not comparable to the abilities of NATO vehicles.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|2A46M-1 (125 mm)}}

Aside from having TVD sights and FCS for time-fuzed HE shells, the 2A46M-1 on T-80UK performs identically to its base model. It has a larger calibre than NATO tanks and access to a variety of ammunition ranging from APFSDS to ATGMs which are good for taking down enemies from distance with devastating firepower. However, the slow overall turret traverse rate still haunts the tank, so it is recommended pre-aim the gun towards directions from which the enemy might suddenly appear for minimal reaction time - the T-80UK doesn't have much to spare.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The T-80UK is a command variant of the T-80U. As such, the playstyle will not change much. The most notable difference between the two tanks is the soft-kill active protection system, which will disrupt the guidance of any ATGMs headed in the direction of the tank, provided the turret is facing the launching vehicle.

While the armour is reasonably good, it will fail to stop some APFSDS rounds, so it is important that you refrain from relying on it. Remember that the armour is not meant to protect the tank, it is meant to protect the crew. With that said, you'll find yourself absorbing a significant portion of poorly-placed or rushed shots in your direction, provided they are not from the side or rear. It is also important to remember, the ERA is expendable. Once it is gone, your tank will be left with significant weak spots that can, and will be abused by your enemies. It is best not to get hit in the first place.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Soft kill passive protection system
* Overall good frontal armour
* Good mobility
* Effective ERA, capable of stopping many of the APFSDS rounds you'll face

'''Cons:'''

* Autoloader carousel is a significant vulnerability
* The vehicle is loud, effectively removing any sense of stealth
* Rather slow turret traverse and reverse speed significantly reduce reactivity
* Subpar gun depression

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Under the Soviet armoured doctrine, tank companies would receive a commander tank just like many major powers during the Cold War. In the Soviet case, the tank would also receive FCS upgrades aside from new communication equipment. The T-80UK was a result of such doctrine, featuring Shtora-1 soft-kill APS, Agava-2 TVD imager, atmospheric sensors, R-163U and R-163K radio, TNA-4 navigation systems, time-fuze controls and AB-1-P28 APU. The tank was likely being tested during the final days of the Soviet Union, and passed state certification during the 1990s. Likely due to insufficient funds and saving Shtora-1 APS for future tanks such as the T-72BU, the current model of the T-80UK looks extremely like an original T-80U with longer antenna for the radio.
