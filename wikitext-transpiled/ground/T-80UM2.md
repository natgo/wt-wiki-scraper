== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Object 219AS-M) is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Russian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Apex Predators"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8021-event-winter-quest-en|2022 Winter Quest]] event.

A prototype of the [[T-80U]] series for possible future upgrades with Drozd hard-kill APS onboard; the tank enjoys the same performance as the well-known T-80U in-game with superb protection and mobility, while also having the chance to intercept incoming missiles.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
From its appearance and by the name itself, T-80UM2 looks very similar to the [[T-80U|tech-tree variant]] with its iconic rubber applique armour on the turret and its Kontakt-5 ERA blocks on the hull. However, the UM2 installs 2 pairs of Drozd APS launchers with 8 rounds of interception projectiles. The base model of the T-80U is infamous for its well-rounded protection against both kinetic and chemical projectiles with up to 600 mm KE protection up front; the sides are also partly covered by extra armour. Due to the cramped interior layout caused by the design philosophy of being low-profile like most other Soviet tanks, while this lowers the chance of being spotted behind terrain, if the tank is penetrated by enemy shots, chances are either the explosion from fuel tank or the 6ETs series autoloader will instantly knock-out the tank. While late/post-Cold War missiles are a major threat for the T-80U as they now have more than enough penetration to take out the tank, the Drozd APS of the UM2 gives it the chance to intercept 4 missiles in total (8 rounds, 2 per salvo) before it has to be rearmed, making T-80UM2's overall survivability better.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,937|rbMinHp=1,106}}

Since the T-80UM2 is based on T-80U without any modifications to mobility, the tank retains the same mobility from the GTD-1250 gas turbine engine. While the single-flow transmission hinders the overall mobility, it can still push the tank up to 70 km/h and has sufficient speed for a retreat.

==== Ammunition ====
The shell options on the T-80UM2 are totally identical to its tech-tree variant: while not having the highest penetration among tanks of its tier, it can still serve its purpose in taking out enemy tanks.

'''3BK18M, HEATFS'''- the most common stock HEATFS for Soviet tanks after the T-64B, although composite armour and ERA are commonplace at its tier, it has higher penetration than its NATO/Chinese counterparts at 550 mm, so it will have better chance to penetrate the sloped parts of MBTs of the same tier. However, in most cases shots that fall on parts covered by composite armour will do no harm to the target, though it is still lethal to light vehicles. So either take the enemies from the flank or aim carefully to disable enemies with the first shot.

'''3OF26, HE-FS'''- the other stock HE-FS for Soviet tanks since the T-64B, a doctrine for Soviet tanks using HE shells to doom armoured targets with its explosive contents. Due to the overpressure mechanic, tanks will have a bad day if hit in their less-covered parts such as gun optics or CITV cameras. This round is also extremely lethal to light vehicles. It is always a good idea to bring some HE alongside other ammunition of your choice.

'''3BM42, Tier I, APFSDS'''- while it is not the best APFSDS at its calibre and tier (Chinese 125-I has 466 mm penetration point-blank at a much lower BR), APFSDS does help ease the stock grind extensively with its flat trajectory and better post-penetration damage; but make sure to aim for the parts where it can penetrate enemy tanks ie. LFP and mantlet.

'''3BM46, Tier IV, APFSDS'''-  if players are not satisfied with the penetration of 3BM42, the 3BM46 now has over 530 mm penetration point-blank and enjoys the same trajectory from its predecessor. In most cases this will be the go-to ammunition for T-80UM2.

'''9M119, Tier III, ATGM'''- Soviet tanks are known to be equipped with gun-launched ATGMs and the T-80UM2 is no exception; it might not have the highest possible penetration of such ATGMs, but it is a valuable option against some well-protected NATO tanks. It can also serve as a makeshift anti-rotorcraft round against helicopters within its elevation and guidance angle.

[[File:Ammoracks_T-80U.png|right|thumbnail|x250px|Ammo racks of the {{PAGENAME}}.]]
The T-80UM2 main ammo rack consists of a mechanized carousel at the bottom of the turret which carries 28 propellants and projectiles.

'''Notes''':

* The {{PAGENAME}} uses two-piece ammunition, composed of projectiles (yellow) and propellant bags (orange). Both have separate racks.
* Projectiles and propellants are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* The 10th rack is the carousel at the bottom of the turret; it serves as first-stage ammo stowage.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Retains identical, well-rounded protection of the T-80U
* Sufficiently high mobility for taking vantage points
* Powerful 125 mm gun with varieties of ammunition at disposal
* Autoloader that ensures constant rate of fire
* Access to Drozd APS for extra protection against oncoming missiles
* Low profile

'''Cons:'''

* Rather cramped interior, any penetrated shots will cause extensive damage
* Lacks protection for fuel tanks where fuel detonation is a instant-kill to the crew in most cases
* The infamous 6ETs series autoloader with a high profile, shots that hit the autoloader will send the turret sky high
* Slower reverse speed than NATO tanks
* Rather insufficient gun depression
* Slow turret traverse rate
* No thermal sight for gunner

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Due to the lack of information about late-USSR equipment and the later Black Eagle program, the APS-equipped T-80U variant is in fact known to the Russian Army as the "T-80 with Drozd APS (ADS)". The UM2 prototype was one of the technological demonstrators for the UM upgrades of the T-80U series made in the 1990s, but economic problems seemingly hindered any further upgrades to the T-80U series.
