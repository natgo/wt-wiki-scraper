== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Object 188M), colloquially known as the "Proryv-3" (Прорыв-3; Breakthrough-3), is the latest mass-production MBT in service with the Russian Army. First spotted in 2017, the T-90M features a redesigned, welded turret, advanced fire control system and remote-controlled weapon station, as well as a new powerplant to keep up with advancing MBT development. The redesign also introduced an autoloader and ammunition layout revision for better survivability in combat.

Introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]], the T-90M introduces further upgrades to enhance its combat capabilities, including a new powerplant, upgraded turret and FCS, as well as access to new Relikt ERA modules for maximum protection. Although the decade-old lack of reverse speed still haunts the vehicle, the overall upgrades on T-90M bring it up to modern standards with improved protection.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
To further enhance mobility as well as compensate for the heavier weight, the T-90M was fitted with the ChTZ V-92S2F engine from the T-72B3 mod. 2016 (post-UBH upgrade). While this increased the acceleration of the vehicle, the unchanged transmission inherited from previous Soviet/Russian MBT designs means it retains the notorious -4.2 km/h reverse speed, so always plan your attack route and seek cover when facing an enemy armoured column - the T-90M's reverse speed won't be much help, especially in open terrain.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The T-90M should be played somewhat cautiously across Arcade, Realistic and Simulator battles due to its poor mobility and gun depression of -6°. However, if played cautiously, the T-90M is an amazing tank having both ample amounts of armour and firepower, which can easily and swiftly take on its two main rivals, being the [[M1A2 SEP V2]] and the [[Leopard 2A7V]].

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Improved gunnery systems
** 3BM42 APFSDS round available stock, with a researchable and powerful 3BM60 APFSDS round also available
** Tandem-warhead barrel launched ATGM is available
** Outstanding thermal vision quality
** Excellent gun handling thanks to the new gun laying motors
* Improved protection
** Strong frontal and side protection with Relikt ERA modules
** Presence of spall liner can save crew members
* Laser Warning System (LWS) alerts of incoming laser guided threats
* Revised ammunition layout and water-cooled ammo rack reducing the risk of detonation
* Autoloader provides a consistent reload speed regardless of crew health and skill
* Improved mobility over previous T-72/T-90 series with 1130 hp engine

'''Cons:'''

* Some flaws inherited from previous designs
** Poor gun depression of -6°
** Fatal -4.2 km/h reverse speed when retreat
** Relatively cramped crew and modules
** Fixed, relatively slow 7.1 second reload equivalent to previous T-72 series/PLAGF MBTs
* Lacks any means of APS, unlike T-90A
* High likelihood of gun system damage due to the protection layout
* Only has 3 crew members

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The T-90M MBT was developed by the Ural Design Bureau of Transport Engineering under the "Breakthrough" modernization program. During this development the T-90 family of tanks received a new welded turret, featuring Relict ERA, an improved engine and a modern fire control system, which includes a panoramic commander sight and multi-channel for the gunner's sight. This modernized variant was presented to the general public in 2017, and since 2019 T-90M tanks have begun to enter service with the Russian Federation's army.
