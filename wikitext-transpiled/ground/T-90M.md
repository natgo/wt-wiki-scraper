== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Air Superiority"]].

The T-90 traces its origins to the Soviet-era [[T-72 (Family)|T-72 tank family]], which was developed during the Cold War as a successor to the T-62 and T-64 tanks. The T-72 was widely exported and saw action in numerous conflicts. The T-90 itself evolved from the T-72 lineage, with the initial models designated T-72BU and later renamed T-90. The T-90M represents the latest iteration of the T-90 series, featuring further upgrades to enhance its combat capabilities. These upgrades include improved armor protection, enhanced firepower with the integration of advanced munitions, and upgraded electronics and targeting systems to improve accuracy and situational awareness. The T-90M is the second tank in Russia’s top rank lineup to receive Relikt ERA, and fourth to have access to the 3BM60 APFSDS round, which significantly improves its armor and lethality.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The T-90M should be played somewhat cautiously across Arcade, Realistic and Simulator battles due to its poor mobility and gun depression of -6°. However if played cautiously, the T-90M is an amazing tank having both ample amounts of armor and firepower, which can easily and swiftly take on its two main rivals, being the M1A2 SEPV2 and the Leopard 2A7V.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->


'''Pros:'''

* 3BM42 APFSDS round available stock, with a researchable and powerful 3BM60 APFSDS round also available

* Excellent gun handling
* Strong frontal armour performs well against both kinetic and chemical projectiles
* Presence of spall liner can save crew members

* Good mobility

'''Cons:'''

* Poor gun depression of -6°
* Slow reverse speed, terrible for retreats

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The T-90M MBT was developed by the Ural Design Bureau of Transport Engineering under the "Breakthrough" modernization program. During this development the T-90 family of tanks received a new welded turret, featuring Relict ERA, an improved engine and a modern fire control system, which includes a panoramic commander sight and multi-channel for the gunner's sight. This modernized variant was presented to the general public in 2017, and since 2019 T-90M tanks have begun to enter service with the Russian Federation's army.
