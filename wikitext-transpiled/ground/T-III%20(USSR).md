== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', or the captured German Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. J, is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Barrel shroud, Cupola)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick while tracks are 20 mm thick.

With only a vertical 50 mm armour plate at the front, even some rank I guns can penetrate the T-III's armour. Angling will not really help, as you will expose your even thinner side armour. However, the lower glacis is quite angled, and most small-calibre rounds will bounce off harmlessly. The ammunition is stored in the back of the tank, minimizing the threat of being ammo-racked.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''PzGr 39''' - {{Annotation|APC|Armour-Piercing Capped}} - This is your main ammo type, use it whenever you think it has enough penetration to penetrate your target. It deals the most damage because of its explosive filler.
* '''PzGr 40''' - {{Annotation|APCR|Armour-Piercing Composite Rigid}} - this variation of APCR is lighter, slightly faster and offers the best penetration (up to 132 mm). Use it against heavily armoured beasts. However, don't expect it to cause any real damage upon penetration. It only deals damage to modules/crew straight in its path, due to the fact that it has no explosive filler.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

This tank is a captured Pz.III J, and plays similarly. While it does have significantly better armour on the front than its predecessor, the higher battle rating means it faces tougher, more well-armoured opposition in uptiers. The [[T-34 (1940)]] is almost impenetrable, except for some weak spots around the turret and flat-on below the tracks. [[M4A1]]s are similar in speed to you, have better sloped frontal armour that you cannot penetrate, more powerful guns, and stabilizers. APCR post-penetration damage is not sufficient enough to be counted upon when you need it the most, plus neither PzGr.40/1 or PzGr.40 can frontally penetrate a Sherman or T-34. The best way to attack these tanks is to flank them with your good mobility, or wait for them to overextend, then shoot at their weaker side armour. Furthermore, the high fuse sensitivity makes many lightly-armoured tank destroyers equipped with strong guns your worst nightmare, since you'll over-penetrate repeatedly in most cases, allowing easy return fire from the enemy. Enemy SPAAG, in particular, is very dangerous because of your 15 mm turret ring weak pot, enabling them to spray all over you to incapacitate your gunner and loader.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Accurate and decently powerful gun
* Great -10° gun depression, useful amongst hills
* Decent mobility
* APCR ammo has very high speed and good penetration, making shooting at long range easier
* Armour can protect reliably against lower-ranked tanks like [[Ha-Go]], [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]]

'''Cons:'''

* Penetration is lacking, as is post-penetration damage against enemies in up-tiers (e.g. [[M4A3 (105)]])
* Awful turret traverse speed, cannot target flankers quickly
* Flat unsloped armour and weak side armour get penetrated easily by common tanks like [[Pz.III F|Pz.III]], [[T-50]], [[SU-76M]]
* Large and weak armour commander's cupola, often sticks out above the terrain, drawing the enemies' attention

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} is the Soviet designation for a captured [[Panzer III]], which saw extensive service during the early phases of Operation Barbarossa. After the battle of Moscow, the Soviet army got a hold of lots of German equipment and it was subsequently evaluated. The T-III was mostly issued as a command vehicle due to its increased comfort and reliable radio. Often times captured vehicles would be refitted with Soviet parts for logistical reasons. It saw combat in the battles of Kursk, Leningrad and Stalingrad, earning themselves a great reputation. The T-III was operated by the Red Army until late 1943 after which they were dropped out of service in favour of newer Soviet vehicles or newly captured [[T-V (USSR)|Panther]] tanks.

The designation used for the captured Pz.Kpfw.lll German medium tank in the Red Army arsenal. The tank was an early modification of the Pz.Kpfw.lll Ausf.J that was armed with a short-barrel 50 mm KwK.38 L/42. The Ausf.J differed from previous modifications by its enlarged frontal body armour (50 mm) and certain mechanical changes. These tanks were popular with Soviet tank crews due to their excellent scopes, their loadout, and the convenience of the crew.
