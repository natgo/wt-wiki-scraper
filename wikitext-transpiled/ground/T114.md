== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
As part of the development of a lightweight armored vehicle that would become the M113, the '''T114''' design was considered for the role of a infantry battalion antitank (BAT) weapon system with the mounting of a 106 mm M40A1 recoilless rifle. The 106 mm M40A1 was mounted in a turret with a three-round magazine and a semiautomatic loader. Two prototypes were built and began testing in December 1960 and continued until January 1961. However, in March 1961, it was decided that the anti-tank carrier version of the T114 (BAT) was no longer necessary and development should focus on making the T114 into a command and reconnaissance vehicle (which would become the M114 CRV).

Introduced in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]], the T114 (BAT) comes in looking like it is straight from a science fiction movie, or from a crazy professor's basement. With a circular turret, autoloader system, and a cannon attached, it has a very unique look. In gameplay, it is a small-sized (just over 2 meters tall) armoured vehicle with good mobility and maneuverability, as well as formidable armament. However, it has weak armor that cannot provide protection even from heavy machine guns. Its main projectile is an anti-tank shaped-charge grenade with decent armor penetration, making the vehicle a dangerous opponent for any kind of enemy equipment it may encounter in battle. The ability to fire several rounds in quick succession allows it to engage multiple targets simultaneously. It is very fragile, but is a very dangerous tank with a skilled player in the commander seat.

{{Notice
 |Trivia: The T114 was the first premium rank V vehicle to be implemented into the game.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The armour is very thin and can be penetrated by heavy machine gun fire from opponents. The crew are cramped together towards the front with only the gunner in the turret. The ammo is exposed by the thin layers of armour which forms its protection - which can be pieced with ease. 

'''Armour type:'''

* Aluminium alloy 7039

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick while tracks are 15 mm thick.
* A 5 mm structural steel plate separates the engine from the crew compartment.
* Belly armour is 25 mm thick.

The T114's thin armour means that all enemy vehicles have very little difficulty in destroying the T114 if it manages to hit it. It is also vulnerable to heavy machine guns as despite its armour thickness, it is built of aluminium that only provides a x0.47 effectiveness of its rated thickness. Air strikes are also a concern as aircraft machine gun and autocannon armaments with armour-piercing capabilities are more than able to get through the T114 and hit the delicate internals.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The mobility of this vehicle is average to good with very responsive handling at speed. It has a good cross country speed on terrain of around 32-50 km/h (20-25 mph). On tarmac roads, the T114 can get up to 56 km/h (35 mph)! Use this to get into a great hiding spot and await the victim.

{{main|M40A1C (106 mm)}}

The gun packs a great punch with up to twenty six rounds of High-Explosive, Anti-Tank, grenades ("HEAT") round, allowing the T114 to take on a wide variety of formidable foes. Considering that the velocity of the projectile is not very fast, it will have to use it almost like a mortar at ranges over 800 m (2,624 ft). Use the terrain and vegetation on the map to get close then engage the enemy in an ambush. The T114 will be able to knock out most tanks if clever with shot placement since it is only equipped with HEAT projectiles. The T114 has a three round magazine for the 106 mm gun, so if the first shot fail to hit, another two can be shot off within few seconds. However, the reload of the magazine will depend heavily on the [[Crew_skills#Ground_vehicles_crew_skills|crew skills]] .

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

This tanks playstyle is similar to a role of a [[:Category:Light_tanks|light tank]], with only two crew, very light armour, only equipped with a 106 mm (10.6 cm) Recoilless Rifle armed with High-Explosive Anti-Tank grenade (similar to an RPG). However, it is just as deadly as any other tank on the battlefield!

Use the speed it offers to get the advantage of the terrain. Use the vegetation of the map to an advantage. Be patient. Be cautious about walls, fences, and objects on the terrain - These will slow the tank down if they are run over and/or hit. It is important not to let the enemy team spot the T114. Stealth is the key. Wait for the enemy tank to appear and for it to expose its side. Calculate the distance and drop of the HEAT round before firing. If calculated successfully, either the enemy tank will be knocked-out or it have sustained major critical damage such as a loss of a crew or gun breech. If it has sustained critical damage, fire another shot into the opposite area of the tank to knock it out. It is very important to aim and knock out the gunner and/or turret crew. Even if the tank was hit and sustained critical damage, if the turret crew was not knocked out and main cannon was inoperable, the machine gun will still be able to penetrate the T114's armour since it has only 32 mm of thickness on the sides and rear with the turret at 38 mm while the front has 44 mm.

The last round in the breech before the auto-loading starts is very important.. Make sure to use it wisely and with caution. If all three rounds are fired, the auto-loading will happen. If the enemy tank is still alive, withdraw as fast as possible and hide until the gun has been loaded.

===Game modes===
====Arcade====
'''In arcade battles''', the T114 can be played akin to that of the [[M18 GMC|M18 Hellcat]] with excellent firepower and mobility, but lacking in armour...very lacking in armour. Since the advantage of surprise and concealment is nullified in Arcade due to the nicknames appearing in that game mode, a more cunning usage is needed in ambushes and brief exposures with maximum damages.

The best ways to use the T114 in arcade is to maximize the gun depression and in "pop-up" manners. Try to find engagements where the enemy is pre-occupied with allies rather than on the T114 to alleviate some risk of being fired upon when spotted. When approaching, find a hill to creep up to until finding the right point where the gun depression allows the recoilless gun to be aimed at the target.

If there are no hills, approach from behind hard cover like a wall and then peek out with the gun pointing at the enemy. It is recommended to approach the wall angled with the front left section towards the wall at an angle, since the gun is mounted offset in the turret to the right, to minimize the exposure of the vehicle when peeking out for a fire. Another way is to reverse out of cover as it would also minimize vehicle exposure of the front. Do not rely on crew damages to save the vehicle and be able to retreat as since there is only two crew members in the vehicle, a single hit that incapacitates a crew will send the vehicle to crew replenishment, immobilizing it for an easy target.

In either case, once exposed and on target, fire the first round and then withdraw back to cover while the autoloader loads the next round. If feeling confident, and fighting a lone tank that has an incapacitated gunner, then it is possible to simply stay in place while the cannon reloads the next round. If aimed correctly, the second should be able to destroy the enemy vehicle, if not then fire the last round in for a final touch, then withdraw while the autoloader is reloaded with three more rounds for another go at another target, or the same one if it is still not destroyed. If an engagement ends with one more round in the autoloader, it is better off firing the last round and let the autoloader stock up with a fresh supply of three more rounds.

Continue until destroyed or achieved victory in the T114.

====Realistic/Simulator====
'''In realistic/simulator battles''', the T114 have the ability to cause mayhem behind the enemy lines without too much hindrance. Go to a capture point on the left or the right flank, wait for targets to appear, and while they are not looking (this is very important) open fire. Try to knock them out or into a state where the tank can get assists. If juggling more than one target, be sure not to be spotted. Once the auto-loading has started, head to cover and wait out the reload. Then, plan another attack. Stay out of sight, even back track and flank harder and deeper.

The best way of getting to the enemy's rear is to use the terrain. Do not drive up the middle of the road or the middle of the map. It will be very easy for the enemy team to knock out the T114. Use the vegetation on the map combined with the terrain and sounds coming of the enemy to avoid any contact with the enemy forces.

Find and locate an area with high vegetation or some urban area which hides the silhouette of this small tank. Lay silent, like a wolf, until the enemy is close. Stay alert. The enemy may be trying the same tactics with other vehicles. Once the enemy is close, wait for them to expose their side armour where the "HEAT" will be able to penetrate them and cause major critical damage, if not blow their turrets clean off their fine vehicles of war. Within urban areas, do not make the T114 known until it is too late. Only pick one tank off at the time. Do not hunt multiple enemy tanks. That will not end well. Make sure the silhouette is not exposed. Simple machine gun fire can terminate this fine tank.

Once the eight clips have been used, pivot turn and run as fast as this tank can go and head to the cap zone to reload. However, use cover in the cap zone. The armour is only up to 44 mm thick in the thicket place (front). Make sure the tank is not exposed to any unnecessary risks or confrontations with the enemy forces. Watch out for enemy units which may be trying to flank from the rear and/or sides to take cap zone.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

In the early 1950s, the US Army started work on developing a new generation of lightly-armoured vehicles, such as APCs. General Motor's Cadillac division proposed two versions of their T114 armoured vehicle to support infantry and anti-tank battalions, respectively. One version would to be armed with a single high calibre machine gun in a full rotatable turret, which would support the infantry battalions, whilst the other would be equipped with a 106mm recoilless gun, serving among the ranks of anti-tank battalions. In 1960, six prototypes of the T114 were built; four armed with machine guns and two armed with the recoilless gun, the latter being named BAT (Battalion Anti-tank) for a short period of time.

The first out of the two T114 BAT prototypes was being tested at Aberdeen proving ground between December 1960 - January 1961, whilst the other prototype remained with the manufacturer for factory tests. Due to unsatisfactory results during testing, all work on the T114 BAT stopped by 1961, with the 2 single prototypes being later converted into the machine gun-armed versions, of which a simplified version would later enter service with the US Army as the M114.
