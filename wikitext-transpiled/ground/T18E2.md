== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 "Advancing Storm"]] in the 2018 "Chronicles of World War II" that took place between the 14th of April till the 10th of May of the same year. It was obtainable by earning 6 "Chronicle awards" in ground vehicles.

The T18E2 is an American heavy armoured car built on an 8 x 8 suspension and features a [[M1 (57 mm)|57 mm M1]] cannon.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The T18E2 is a heavy armoured car that favours protection over the high mobility common to the class.  The T18E2's hull is solidly protected from heavy machine guns and artillery shrapnel, but most opponents at this battle rating can penetrate it without trouble.  Despite sufficient armour to protect the crew, the transmission located under the floor armour is very susceptible to damage from artillery.

The vehicle carries a full complement of 5 crew members. A driver and MG gunner sit together in the forward driving compartment, while the Gunner, Loader, and Commander sit in close proximity in the rather small turret in the fighting compartment. Altogether, a well placed APHE round can be enough to knock out all of the crew members in the vehicle but may survive multiple solid shots of AP or APCR rounds, especially from the side. However, the crew is positioned deceptively high off the ground above an armoured floor, and so shots to the very lower glacis frequently only damage the transmission.

'''Armour type''':

* Cast Homogeneous armour (turret, hull front and sides)
* Rolled Homogeneous armour (hull rear and hull roof)
* Structural Steel (fender, various boxes along the hull, and vents on engine compartment)
* Wheels

'''Notes:'''

* Floor armour is only 10 mm thick, though the suspension mounting found between each pair of wheels is reinforced with 13 mm of armour underneath the vehicle.
* Turret ring armour is 25 mm thick.
* Structural steel boxes and drums of 5 mm thick dot the exterior of the car, which can add some precious little armour thickness.
* Wheels are 10 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=387|rbMinHp=221}}

In RB/SB mode, the {{PAGENAME}} is a very sluggish vehicle, especially compared to other armoured cars. Despite its listed top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), most drivers will only see up to 65 km/h (40 mph) on paved roads and 39 km/h (24 mph) cross country depending on terrain. Even so, with its low power to weight ratio of 10.41 hp/ton (in comparison to 14.44 hp/ton of the M3 Lee), it takes driving relatively straight for a long while for it to reach these speeds. Best stick to paved roads when you can if you need to be somewhere quick and avoid muddy terrain altogether like that found at White Rock Fortress, where mud can drag your speed down to as low as 8 km/h (5 mph), leaving you vulnerable if trying to cross potential fire zones quickly.

The {{PAGENAME}} also possesses a very high top reverse speed of -36 km/h (-20 mph), though again because of its low acceleration, will take some time to possibly reach this. However, in comparison to other tanks, the reverse acceleration and eventual speed is still acceptable for quick retreats. This can even mitigate the disadvantage that the vehicle requires a large turn radius to turn around.

'''Notes:'''

*Recommended load is 24&nbsp;''(+40)'' to keep the hull empty of ammo.
*1st and 2nd ammo racks are ready racks, and takes priority in being filled at the beginning of the battle, then fills 5, 4, then 3.
*Full reload speed will be realized as long as ammo exists in either ready rack.  If both ready racks are empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.
*Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will load ammo from racks 3-5 into 2 then 1, as long as there is ammo in racks 3-5.  Firing will interrupt the loading of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Though this is an armoured car, this is best played as a tank destroyer, as the gun is arguably the best feature on this tank. Even with your sluggish speeds, you should be able to keep up with most medium tanks and provide support to them, letting them soak up damage while you dish out it back with your great gun.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Quick-firing 57 mm cannon that can fire as quick as 4 seconds with an ace crew
* High penetration APHE shell can make short work of foes
* Large ready-rack of 24 shells
* Can scout targets like other Rank II light tanks
* Good speeds can be reached on paved roads
* Armour will protect it from heavy machine guns from nearly any angle
* Carries a smoke mortar, able to shoot up to 14 smoke grenades
* Possesses a vertical gun stabilizer to increase accuracy at low speeds

'''Cons:'''

* Transmission is easily knocked out by artillery shrapnel
* Slows down substantially when crossing muddy terrain or deep snow
* Very sluggish acceleration, will take a while to reach high speeds
* Large turning radius, can be problematic in narrow streets or environments
* Any calibre bigger than 14.5 mm will likely tear through the car at close range
* Only possesses AP and APHE, no HE available
* Lacks a .50 calibre machine gun unlike most other US vehicles
* Slower turret traverse rate than other US tanks

=== T18 ===
'''Development'''

The US Army Ordnance Corps released a requirement in 1941 for a medium armoured car and a heavy armoured car to be exported to Britain. Ford built the T17 Deerhound and T17E1 Staghound for the medium requirement. Development for the heavy armoured car was headed by the Yellow Coach Company.

The prototype for the heavy armoured car was displayed in 1942, and the design became the T18. It was being designed for the British Army, who wanted them for the war in North Africa, where the mobility of armoured cars would be beneficial at the time.

'''Design'''

The T18 used an 8x8 wheeled chassis with four total axles, the front two paired together and the rear two paired together. The vehicle had a length of 20.4 feet, a width of 10 feet, and a height of 8.5 feet. It weighed around 30 tons, and was operated by a crew of five, with the driver and co-driver/machine gunner in the hull front and the commander, gunner, and loader in the turret.

The three-man turret was located on the center of the hull. The main armament consisted of a 37 mm M6 anti-tank gun. A coaxial 7.62 mm M1919A4 was mounted in the turret, and a second M1919 machine gun was ball-mounted in the hull front for use by the co-driver/machine gunner.

Armour protection of the T18 was from 9.5 mm to 50.8 mm.

The T18 was powered by two GMC 6-cylinder engines, each producing 125 horsepower, for a total of 250 horsepower. The T18 could reach speeds of 50 miles per hour and had a range of 250 miles.

=== T18E2 Boarhound ===
'''Development'''

Before the T18 had been delivered to the British Army, it was seen in the North African theatre that the 37 mm had become insufficient against the latest German panzers. As such, it was decided to replace the 37 mm M6 gun with a 57 mm M1 anti-tank gun (a license-produced version of the QF 6-pounder). Sixty 57 mm projectiles were carried, and 2,500 rounds of machine gun ammunition were carried as well. The vehicle with the 57 mm gun was designated as the '''T18E2'''.

'''Production and Service'''

The T18E2 was designated by the British Army as the Boarhound, and 2,500 Boarhounds were planned to be acquired. By the time deliveries began, the war in North Africa was coming to a close, and the Boarhound also had poor off-road mobility. These factors, in addition to a high unit cost, caused the British Army to cut the order short at just 30 units. Very few Boarhounds saw combat, and none saw heavy combat. They were mostly used for convoy escort, base defence, or reconnaissance.
