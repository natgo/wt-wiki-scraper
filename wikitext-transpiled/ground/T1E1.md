== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The armor is almost the same as the armor the one of the [[M6A1]] has, it's just more angled and rounded for better ricochet chances and efficient armour thickness. The weak spots are the viewing slit to the right of the machine guns and the unangled part on the lower hull.

'''Armour type:'''

* Cast homogeneous armour (Front, Transmission area, Turret, Side, Rear, Roof)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (Side, Rear, Roof)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 15 mm thick while tracks are 17 mm thick.
* Lower side armor has holes thus armour thickness varies between just armour skirt (25.4mm) and armor skirt + hull (25.4mm + 70mm).etter ricochet chances and efficient armour thickness.
* Side skirts are 25 mm thick rolled homogeneous armour and will trigger fuses on APHE projectiles. In most cases, APHE shells set off before reaching the main hull and destroying the ammo stack beneath. Still, both skirts and hull<!-- Any additional notes which the user needs to be aware of -->
<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The T1E1 is able to penetrate the front of most tanks at its BR with the 76 mm gun and can destroy most smaller enemies in a single shot. With the 37 mm cannon, you can still detrack enemy vehicles or damage cannon barrels. You may also bait your enemy out of cover by firing the 37 mm gun and using the 76 mm when they get out of cover. In addition to the 76 mm and 37 mm guns, you get 3 x .50 cal MGs which are very affective against light vehicles and SPAAs. The playstyle is similar to the M6A1, with the main difference being the reverse speed for the T1E1. The reverse gearbox allows for a scoot-and-shoot play-style with the player being able to move backwards and forwards at a impressive speed.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Reverse gearbox allows to quickly pull out a difficult situation
* 37 mm gun is great for destroying tracks
* Large crew of six
* 3 x .50 cal machine guns

'''Cons:'''

* Weak hull side armour
* Hull corners make angling ineffective
* Contains some frontal weak spots

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>.
