== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. The {{PAGENAME}} was introduced in the [[Update 1.59 "Flaming Arrows"]] as a gift vehicle and was available on the Gaijin store as a [[wt:en/news/3742-shop-pre-order-packs-for-update-1-59-flaming-arrows-with-exclusive-decals-en|pre-order pack]] before the update. The {{PAGENAME}} is a formidable heavy tank that introduces the 105 mm T5 cannon in a rotating turret rather than in the fixed case-mate setting like the [[T95]], with a tougher-than-average gun mantlet, and a sloped, but slightly thin hull.

The {{PAGENAME}} is perhaps one of the best performing heavy tanks at Rank IV, right up there with the [[IS-2 (Family)|IS-2]] and [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]] tanks. Thanks to the 105 mm cannon, the {{PAGENAME}} can engage most enemies it faces on the battlefield from the front, often destroying an enemy tank with a single shot with the extremely powerful T13 APCBC round. With a frontal armour thick enough to block most incoming shots, The {{PAGENAME}} can act as the "damage sponge" of the team by absorbing or shrugging off most of the enemy fire. As its gun has a high muzzle velocity, it can also act as a sniping tank by positioning in the back or sides of the map and fire at any unsuspecting enemy tank. A single T13 APCBC round can destroy even the strongest tank if it penetrates the side armour. Like other heavy tanks, the {{PAGENAME}} has an average mobility but has a lower top speed than its main rivals: the IS-2 mod. 1944 and the Tiger II (H) and only better than the Caernarvon. Nonetheless, it possesses an above-average acceleration, making it more suited for dense environments.

Notes:

* The {{PAGENAME}} uses two-piece ammunition, composed of projectiles (yellow) and propellant bags (orange). Both have separate racks.
* Projectiles and propellants are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 3*, 4* and 5* are first stage ammo racks. They total 8 projectiles and 8 propellant bags.
* These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied early.
* The projectiles' depletion order at full capacity is: 5 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4.
* The propellants' depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 1 - 2.

One of the hidden gems of this tank, the three .50cals enable a player to effectively blind enemies, shred lightly armoured vehicles, and engage unsuspecting aircraft. Two of the machine guns are mounted in the turret and are controlled by the gunner. They are locked with the sight of the main gun, thus are also subjected to the limited elevation angles of the turret. The third machine gun is located at the roof of the turret and is pintle-mounted. While this top gun is technically able to freely move around, its actual training speed is rather slow. It is best to use this gun to engage slower moving aircraft or those flying in a predictable path.

One spicy advantage of the .50cal is its ability to de-track enemy vehicles in close-quarters. With three .50cals, immobilizing enemy tanks at close range will take a matter of seconds, and grant you the tactical initiative against whoever's tracks you just shredded.

== Usage in battles ==

;Combat tactics

* In an ''offensive role'', the {{PAGENAME}} can be used in 2 main ways. The more common and safer strategy is to team up with another tank, preferably a heavy or medium tank. Move up to the frontline while covering each other, leapfrog each time so one tank snipes an enemy while the other moves to a cover position with an advantageous firing position, then keep advancing at a safe pace. The other method is to get right up in their face, only giving them shots at the {{PAGENAME}}'s tough frontal armour. As aggressive this strategy is, it leaves the {{PAGENAME}} open to attacks from the sides. This is a last-ditch strategy generally. In either offence strategy, the biggest risk is getting too far ahead from the rest of your allies, leaving the {{PAGENAME}} vulnerable and without any supporting fire.

* In a ''defensive role'', the {{PAGENAME}} truly shines in a hull down position. Frontally, its turret is tough and the cheeks are sloped enough to bounce most shots. The only real target available would be the small cupola on the turret roof and the turret ring if it is not covered. While the gun barrel is vulnerable to being broken, a moderate crew can repair it in seconds. Although the gun depression angle isn't as great as other American tanks, it still provides an advantage in hilly terrain. When in the right spot, the player can devastate the enemy team with almost no risk to themselves by exposing only the gun barrel and the top of the mantlet. Be aware that there are certain spots and ports in the mantlet that can be penetrated even by a Wirbelwind using PzGr 40 rounds. Players experienced with American heavies can find a good spot that will provide them with ample cover while they support the team. Wiggling the turret while reloading can make the enemy bounce, same tactics as seen with the IS-2. Some shots to the lower gun mantlet may also bounce downwards and penetrate the thin hull roof.

;Notable enemies

* [[Tiger II (P)]] and [[Tiger II (H)|(H)]]: These are going to be the most common and equal enemy. While most of the {{PAGENAME}}'s front armour can take on the 88 mm APCBC round, APCR can penetrate the front mantlet of the turret. It can also aim for the lower glacis on the hull, which will knock-out the driver and can repeatedly do this until the entire crew gets knocked out. To fight the Tiger II's, aim at the cheeks of the turret with any ammo, preferably the right as that is where the gunner sits. Using the T32 APBC ammo, there is a chance that it can penetrate the Tiger II's front glacis at close range (less than 100 m) and the lower glacis from even further, making the T32 round probably the most preferable round to use against the Tiger II's front. If the {{PAGENAME}} can get the Tiger's side though, a simple T13 APCBC round can turn a Tiger II into a fiery ball of fire.
* [[Tiger II (10.5 cm Kw.K)]]: Though the same rule applies to the 88 mm Tiger II, take extreme caution as the 10.5 cm cannon can penetrates the {{PAGENAME}}'s mantlet from the front and devastate interior. Rounds aimed at the Tiger II 10.5's rangefinder (bulges on the sides of the turret) may splash inside the turret, knocking out the gunner and likely a loader as well.
* [[Jagdpanther]]: Equipped with the same 88 mm as on the Tiger II, this tank destroyer can do some damage if it can get a good shot. However, the {{PAGENAME}}'s 105 mm cannon can easily penetrate through its front glacis, just don't shoot too close to the gun or the gun mantlet may bounce it.
* [[Ferdinand]]: The greater armour on this tank destroyer makes it harder to fight in a long-range engagement. However, if the {{PAGENAME}} can get closer, the flat armour space on the top superstructure and the hull front can prove more vulnerable. Of course, getting to the side of this tank destroyer is a guaranteed point if an APCBC round can be landed into it.
* [[ISU-152]]: While easily destroyed by one shot of the 105 mm cannon, the 152 mm howitzer still can do unspeakable damage if it hits the {{PAGENAME}}'s vulnerable turret and hull roof.

;Defeating a {{PAGENAME}}

* With 4 crewmen sitting in the turret, any penetrating shot to the turret with a good post-penetration damage means most certainly the destruction of your vehicle.
* In a frontal encounter, aim for the {{PAGENAME}}'s lower glacis or the hull MG port (small area).
* When flanking, aim for the hull section under the turret. Make sure to avoid shooting the tracks. Follow up with a shot at the driver's position if it survives.
* You can also aim at the engine compartment to immobilize the {{PAGENAME}} and then let your teammates finish it.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Armed with an extremely good 105 mm gun that's far superior to the T32's 90 mm gun
* T13 round has both high penetration power and post-penetration damage potential. Penetrating an enemy's crew compartment is almost always a kill
* Has a great set of optics with magnification levels of 4x-8x. Great for both quick close range target acquisition and long range sniping
* Great overall turret armour. Only guns that penetrate more than 200 mm of armour pose a real threat
* 10 degrees of gun depression coupled with the really strong turret makes the {{PAGENAME}} great at shooting from ridgelines and hull-down fighting
* Armed with three .50 cal machine guns, allowing the {{PAGENAME}} to easily damage lightly armoured vehicles and tracks

'''Cons:'''

* The lower glacis plate is both long and weakly armoured. Any gun packing over 165 mm of penetration poses a threat if the lower plate is visible
* Unlike most tanks at the BR, the sides of the engine compartment are much weaker than the sides of the hull. Coupled with the placement of the turret, this means the {{PAGENAME}} isn't good at side scraping 
* Guns like the Tiger II's 88 mm can punch right through the gun mantlet from 500 m
* Tall silhouette like the Tiger II, making it very hard to hide
* The T29 is much slower than other heavy tanks at the same BR
* The {{PAGENAME}} has a large amount of ammunition lining the right turret cheek and rear turret compartment
* Only one of the .50 cal machine guns can effectively engage aircraft flying higher than coaxial level

===Development===
Projects for a dedicated heavy tank for the U.S. Armed Forces began in March 1944 as a response to the German heavy tanks that have been popping up in Europe. While the T26E3 tank, later known as the [[M26]] Pershing was slated to be the next-generation American tank, it was still considered unsuitable against the even heavier [[Tiger II (H)|Tiger II]]. A project to increase the armour and firepower commenced countering this problem, the project titled '''Heavy Tank T29'''. Using design elements from the T26E3 with thicker armour and lengthened hull, the T29 also was equipped with the [[T5E2 (105 mm)|105 mm Gun T5]], a gun in development alongside the heavy assault tank [[T95]]. Other features included a 770 hp Ford GAC engine, armour thickness up to 279 mm effective, and a coincidence range-finder. The heavy armour and armament made the tank weigh about 64 tons, making it a close match to the Tiger II.

Though the T29 was monstrous itself, side projects involving the T29 crafted the [[T30|T30 Heavy Tank]]. Itself similar to the T29 in terms of armour, but featured a monstrous [[T7 (155 mm)|155 mm Gun T7]] with a more powerful engine and an extra crew member to facilitate loading the gun.

===Effect in World War II===
Throughout World War II, the T29 and the T30 stayed in development under the priority "limited procurement". Eventually, the war in Europe ended in May 1945, but the small ordered stayed in hope it may be useful in the Japan invasion in Operation Downfall. That hope was smashed as well when Japan surrendered in September 1945, ending World War II. Even if an operation commenced that used these vehicles, the Army Ground Forces objected to the use of such heavy equipment due to the lack of adequate transporters. Further production was cancelled in the post-war demilitarization.

===Post World War Effect===
The heavy tank concept didn't end with the war and a final attempt was made to remake the T29 into a more modern, lethal weapon system. This produced the [[T34|T34 Heavy Tank]], which mounted a 120 mm gun based on the M1 anti-aircraft gun. The calibre made an adequate balance of firepower and loading ease between the 105 mm and the 155 mm used in the T29 and T30. In fact, the two T34 pilot models made were a converted T29 and T30. However, the demilitarization took down the T34 program as well, but the experience in this project help engineers in the development of the [[M103|M103 Heavy Tank]].

Today, there are a few T29s still in display across the United States, most of them residing in storage at Fort Benning, Georgia where they will be used as a display in the future National Armor and Cavalry Museum.
