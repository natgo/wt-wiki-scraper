== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 "Regia Aeronautica"]].

Presenting a 90 mm smoothbore cannon, it is currently the first tank in the American tree line that uses APFSDS ammunition.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 3 and 4 are first stage ammo racks. They total 22 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
* These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 1 - 2.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 and 2 into racks 4 then 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The T95E1's playstyle consists of mostly setting up ambushes and/or on the frontlines. The APFSDS shell has more than enough power to destroy most tanks that it will face; however, on a uptier against [[Leopard A1A1]]'s, [[T-62M-1]]'s, and generally any 8.7 to 9.0 MBT, you will need to play more cautiously, thus the ambushing tactics come into play. You must be extremely aware of what is around you and be quicker than your enemy on the gun because the lack of stabilizers will make shooting on the move very difficult.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Stock APFSDS able to penetrate most enemies frontally
* Excellent post-penetration spalling from APFSDS
* Sloped frontal armour can bounce multiple shots with ease, but upper glacis and turret front bounce shots to each other
* Very good stock horizontal turret traverse
* Good gun depression of -10°, allows for some hull-down tactics
* High velocity firing makes long-range fighting easier, especially in the large maps
* Has a Smoothbore gun, with excellent recoil mount that decreases the recoil
* Acceptable top speed of 56 km/h
* The smoke shell (T339E14) has high velocity which helps you save allies at a long distance

'''Cons:'''

* Poor acceleration and low top speed cross-country
* Low reverse speed relative to other American medium tanks
* A prominent weak spot in the form of commander's cupola
* No ammunition choices other than APFSDS or HE
* No stabiliser - unable to accurately fire on the move
* Front armour vulnerable against sabot and HEAT rounds
* Limited accuracy of smoothbore cannon at long range
* Engine deck prevents the turret depression
* Rear hull armour can be penetrated with .50 cals and therefore, engine and transmission are prone to damage
* Large ammo racks to the sides of driver, front hull penetration could lead to easy ammo detonation.
* Like with most Abrams series tanks, the engine deck is slightly raised, meaning that you will not be able to depress the gun over the rear of the tank.
* Lacking night vision device in an uptier

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
In the early 1950s, the US began looking for a replacement for the M48 series.  In September 1954, the T95 was selected for development; construction of pilot models began in 1957.  The T95E1 differed from the T95 in the inclusion of a recoil system mount and the omission of a two-plane stabilizer, and was completed in early 1958.

The T95 program was shut down in July 1960 when it became clear that both the engine power and smoothbore cannon's accuracy were unsatisfactory and would provide no significant improvements over the M48 already in service.  However, further development of the turret design contributed significantly to the turret used later on the M60A1.
