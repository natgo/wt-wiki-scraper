== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Red Skies"]]. Sitting between the [[TAM]] and [[TAM 2C]] in terms of performance, this tank is essentially an earlier TAM model with access to more modern ammunition and add-on armour for increased protection.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Base armour of the TAM 2IP is very thin, just an 11 mm plate angled at 74° on the upper frontal glacis, and 15 mm of armour on the sides. Turret is not something to boast about either - the strongest plate being a gun mantlet with a 30 mm plate and sides being 25 mm thin.

On the bright side, the 2IP version is fitted with Iron Wall add-on composite armour. This variable thickness armour package increases effectiveness of armour against late Cold War era chemical munitions, but has no effect on kinetic penetrators.

'''Front'''

Most noticeable increase in protection is on the upper plate of the hull, but sadly this doesn't help much since it offers only ~300 mm protection against chemical rounds which are a rarity at its BR .

Add-on protection on the turret is not enough to defeat those same munitions. Frontal arc protection against autocannons is mostly great, but occasional lucky shots can penetrate the turret ring.

Players also must be aware of the giant weak spot that is the driver's area - it is only 11 mm plate angled at 74° and it is not protected by add-on armour, allowing vehicles like [[Dardo]] to get through.

'''Sides'''

While the TAM 2IP is now resistant to 12.7 mm rounds on the hull side, overall side protection remains poor, as it can still get easily penetrated by anything larger than 12.7 mm.

'''Back'''

Since it's a light tank you won't show your back too much but it didn't receive any add-on armour so it's really easy to penetrate.

'''Crew'''

When looking at the TAM 2IP from the front, one can see that on the left side, the commander sits directly behind the gunner, while the loader sits almost directly behind the driver on the right side.

Both gunner and commander are protected by the transmission and the engine ([[Merkava (Family)|similar to Merkava tanks]]); while that won't protect them from most kinetic munitions, it can negate shrapnel from older chemical and HESH rounds that manages to get through add-on armour.

The driver is very vulnerable as he sits behind an 11 mm thin plate angled at 74°, with a first-stage ammo rack and loader directly behind him. Driver's area is not protected by add-on armour either.

'''Armour type:'''

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
Even with additional protection, the TAM 2IP suffers no decrease to its mobility when compared to its tech tree counterpart; thus is more mobile and agile than its main competitor, Leopard A1A1. This mobility allows the TAM 2IP to perform many different roles, be it flanking, scouting, rushing favourable positions or relocating.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|FMK.4 Modelo 1L (105 mm)}}

Main armament consists of the 105 mm FMK.4 Modelo 1L cannon; a fully stabilised gun that is standard to the TAM family. Unlike TAM however, it has access to DM33, a very potent round at its BR. The TAM 2IP also comes equipped with a laser rangefinder - this gadget allows it to quickly acquire a target's distance, thus allowing long range shots immensely fast.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''DM12 HEATFS''' - HEAT round does not lose penetration with distance travelled. Unlike kinetic penetrators, it has one downside: given that it is a chemical round, its fuse is highly sensitive. With the emergence of composite and reactive armour, it quickly became obsolete in the anti-tank role. Requires careful aiming to properly damage newer tanks, though it can hold its own while fighting older tanks, lighter vehicles and low-flying helicopters.
* '''DM512 HESH''' - This round was always plagued by a plethora of problems: low velocity, low penetration, inconsistent mechanics and sensitive fuse make this round gimmicky at best. That being said, with the overpressure mechanic, this round can be used in CQB against light vehicles with devastating effect.
* '''DM23 APFSDS''' - This round allows the player to engage modern tanks more reliably, since it performs better against composite and reactive armour. While penetration is sufficient relative to the TAM 2IP's BR, there is simply no use for this round as its direct upgrade is available from the get go.
* '''DM33 APFSDS''' - Best round available to the TAM 2IP and third best NATO round available for 105 mm cannons. It allows the player to engage '''any''' enemies at the TAM 2IP's BR at any range reliably. Even higher BR vehicles are not safe. Player should be of note that this round can easily over penetrate light vehicles such as BMP-2 or SPAAGs, so aiming at vital components is preferred in order to create shrapnel necessary to destroy them.

'''Notes:'''

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 3 and 4 are first stage ammunition racks (29 shells total), meaning they will deplete first but will replenish from the other racks (rack 4 then 3), starting with rack 1 and then rack 2.
* The depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 1 - 2.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|FN MAG 60-40 (7.62 mm)}}

The small calibre of the FN MAG 60-40 machine guns make them largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. They still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

While the TAM 2IP can still perform well as a regular main battle tank, using it this way would be just wasting its potential. It's a fast, potent flanker, but with the addition of a powerful DM33 round, the TAM 2IP is also a potent sniper.

'''Sniping:'''

Players should abuse the TAM 2IP's mobility to reach advantageous positions and start picking off players. DM33 highly effective (only [[T-62M-1]] providing better performance) and coupled with laser range finder, the TAM 2IP can snipe really well. While it can't fight as well in hull down positions as Leopard A1A1 due to slightly worse gun depression, it can still make great use of cover, as it negates its biggest weakness - armour. Use the TAM 2IPs fast speed to get to a good position where you won't be seen and a lot of enemies will pass by. Start picking them off with your round and relocate after a couple of shots.

'''Flanking:'''

Due to the TAM 2IPs excellent mobility, stabilised gun and powerful round, the TAM 2IP is a potent flanker. Add-on armour allows it to shrug off most autocannon fire from IFVs, as those will be common flankers at this BR. Coupled with scouting ability, a TAM 2IP employing hit and run tactics on flanks can become the enemy team's worst nightmare.

'''CQB:'''

While the TAM 2IP performs great at longer ranges, its performance is below average on CQC maps with corridors and streets that do not allow it to exploit its mobility, like those found on Advance to Rhine. Better armoured tanks in general outperform the TAM 2IP by wide margin in these environments. Players should focus on ambushing enemy tanks. The TAM 2IP's turret placement on the back of the tank and acceleration can be exploited in this scenario well - by reversing out of cover, your engine is still protected while you expose only a small part of your tank. Another viable option is to support their allies. Let them take a shot, and as soon as you see the enemy tank return fire, lunge forward and send the enemy back to the garage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* DM33 APFSDS is more than competitive at this BR
* Same mobility as regular TAM, despite add-on armour
* Wide selection of ammunition
* Laser rangefinder

'''Cons:'''

* Despite add-on armour, protection remains somewhat poor
* Big silhouette
* No thermals
* Lacks smoke shell, limiting its tactical potential

The TAM 2IP is the second improved version of the [[TAM|Tanque Argentino Mediano (TAM)]] in its modernization process after the [[TAM 2C]]. It was officially presented to the public on May 29, 2016 during the celebrations for the Day of the Argentine Army. The project is part of the collaboration program with the Israel Military Industries (IMI), the modernization project adds an additional armour kit along the chassis, the front and the sides of the turret, as well as side skirts.
