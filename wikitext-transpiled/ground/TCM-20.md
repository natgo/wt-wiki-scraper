== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was the modification of M3 half-truck with TCM-20 turret by IDF. This was likely a field modification done by Israeli during their early days with sparse military equipment where they would have to used decade-old vehicles as the chassis to modify with a TCM-20 turret, including captured 6x6 trucks, BTR-152 and aided M3 half-truck; the TCM-20 turret itself was an upgraded M55 Quadmount turret (M45 turret on M20 trailer) with 2 Hisapano Hs.404 20 mm autocannons for better firepower. The lack of documents on the introduction of these modified vehicles make it hard to trace the history of them but they were likely been replaced by more advanced [[Hovet|M163 VADS (Hovet)]] with radar rangefinder by 1975.

Introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]] alongside with the Israeli tech-tree's SPAA, players will soon find similarities with M13 GMC in service with US Army. But upon closer look, these .50 cal HMGs are replaced by two 20 mm HS.404 autocannons, further enhancing its firepower against aircrafts or sometimes suppressing ground targets if needed.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
M3 half-truck has been a staple of US Army since 1940s as one of the most widely-used half-truck during the WWII alongside with Wehrmacht's Sdkfz series; these vehicles are universal chassis which could be converted for different missions i.e. anti-aircraft. In Israeli's case, the overall appearance of TCM-20 is very similar to M13 GMC but the larger guns and additional .30 cal M1919A4 gives its identity away. To put its protection in simple words: the vehicle is not even rated for rifle-caliber firearms at close distance. The thickest armor plate is the windshield but do not expect it will stop HMG from afar, although the engine block will absorb oncoming fire when head-on with enemies, in most cases - never, ever run into enemy fire lines or being preyed by aircrafts as these will end your career quickly; do also beware of high explosive shells or shrapnel, sometimes even close-calls could bring an end to TCM-20.

=== Mobility ===

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
M3 half-trucks shares the same White 160AX petrol engine which could output up-to 148 hp and the transmission could ensure its mobility both forwards and backwards; it can still retain the speed of all-wheel vehicles while crossing complicated terrains with ease.

{{main|HS.404 (20 mm)}}

The modified M55 turret (now called TCM-20) houses two HS. 404 20 mm autocannon, if the name does ring the bell in player's brain, this is also the gun used on French [[M.B.157]] at the very same configuration and ammo count. It can be said that TCM-20 is a M.B.157 on wheels and tracks, thanks to the flat ballistic of HS.404, players will soon get in hand of the performance of the cannons; not only it can take out aircrafts as it been intended on different platforms, this also make sure light vehicles will have to think twice before appearing in front of a TCM-20, the rate of fire and penetration will make sure they will not get away with ease.

{{main|M1919A4 (7.62 mm)}}

To compensate for the lack of continuous firepower against infantry, TCM-20 installed a M1919A4 for the commander to suppress enemies; while it is nowhere harmful to enemy armored vehicles, there might be some occasions where enemies have exposed crews and the .30 cal could make short work of them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
For players who have player M13 GMC in US tech-tree, it can be said that TCM-20 is an successor to M13 to some extent, especially its iconic twin gun configuration. However, when enemy aircrafts get too close, they will find out the major difference: they would soon be shattered by the 20 mm HS.404 autocannons, recalling the memories from being chased by aircrafts with these cannons. Such "upgrade" is very welcomed as 20 mm caliber is still more than enough to take out strafing fighters with ease, with overall 720 rounds onboard at 120 rounds per load, if players get used to the relatively straight ballistics and not being trigger-happy, the overall efficiency could be on-par with other SPAAs in other tech trees with their respective advantages. Most of all, the M3 chassis ensured TCM-20 could get to where it is needed as soon as possible thanks to its 72 km/h top speed, making it a viable option to flank enemies in some occasions; while the 13 km/h reverse speed could still make sure it can retreat to cover if masses of enemies/menacing aircrafts rushing to where the vehicle is. As said, TCM-20 is still a half-truck based SPAAG with minimal protection; in fact rifle-caliber firearms can harm the crew at around 200 m from the sides, let along HMGs and autocannons at even higher penetration, so be extra careful on where players should appear - rushing or running into heated frontline is certainly a death sentence to TCM-20. Overall, TCM-20 is still a good AA half-truck to handle different types of vehicles, whether it's on wheels, tracks or flying ones.

All things aside, there is an rare problem for most tech-trees in-game, but now exclusive to Israel: although it has BR at 4.3 (all modes), but due to the lack of lower tier WWII vehicles, TCM-20 will be at least at BR 6.0 alongside with M-51 Sherman; most vehicles at this tier will have side armor with at least 50 mm protection, at only 42 mm penetration at point-blank range, hunting down medium tanks is not an option in this case. So pick the target wisely when you opt to flank enemies - pick either SPAAGs or light tanks in this case to maximize damage; alternatively finding covers and wait for aerial targets to get close enough to deliver fatal blow to them.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Devastating 20 mm autocannon which works well against aircrafts
* Rather mobile, can swiftly changes its position if needed 
* Quick turret traverse speed for target acquisition 
* Spare .30 cal machine gun for occasion unprotected crews of enemy vehicles

*

'''Cons:'''

* Lightly protected up to rifle caliber firearms, also prone to overpressure
* Relatively small ammo pool per load (60 per gun)
* Insufficient penetration due to the battle rating
