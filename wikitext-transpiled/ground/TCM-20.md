== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' was an Israeli modification of the M3 half-track with a TCM-20 turret. This was likely a field modification done by Israel during their early days with sparse military equipment, mounting TCM-20 turrets on decade-old vehicles, including captured 6x6 trucks, BTR-152, and M3 half-tracks. The TCM-20 turret itself was an upgraded M55 Quadmount turret (M45 turret on M20 trailer) with two Hispano Hs.404 20 mm autocannons for better firepower. The lack of documents on the introduction of these modified vehicles makes it hard to trace their history, but they were likely replaced by the more advanced [[Hovet|M163 VADS (Hovet)]] with radar rangefinder by 1975.

Introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]] along with the initial Israeli ground tree, players will soon find similarities with the M13 MGMC in service with the US Army. However, the .50 cal HMGs are replaced by two 20 mm HS.404 autocannons, enhancing its firepower against aircraft or sometimes suppressing ground targets if needed.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The M3 half-track has been a staple of the US Army since the 1940s as one of the most widely-used half-tracks during the WWII alongside the Wehrmacht's Sd.Kfz series; these vehicles are a universal chassis which could be converted for different missions i.e. anti-aircraft. In Israel's case, the overall appearance of the TCM-20 is very similar to the [[M13 MGMC]], but the larger guns and additional .30 cal M1919A4 gives its identity away. The vehicle is not rated for even rifle-calibre firearms at close distance. The thickest armour plate is the windshield, but do not expect it to stop HMG fire, even from afar. The engine block may absorb oncoming fire when head-on with enemies. In most cases, never, ever run into enemy fire lines or become targeted by aircraft, as these will end your career quickly; do also beware of high explosive shells or shrapnel, sometimes even close-calls could bring an end to the TCM-20.

=== Mobility ===

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
M3 half-tracks share the same White 160AX petrol engine which could output up to 148 hp and the transmission could ensure its mobility both forwards and backwards; it can still retain the speed of all-wheel vehicles while crossing complicated terrain with ease.

{{main|HS.404 (20 mm)}}

The modified M55 turret (now called TCM-20) houses two HS.404 20 mm autocannon, the same gun used in many early French aircraft, with the same configuration and ammo count. Thanks to the flat ballistic of HS.404, players will soon get to grips with the performance of the cannons. Not only can it take out aircraft as it was intended, it also ensures that light vehicles will have to think twice before appearing in front of a TCM-20, the rate of fire and penetration will make sure they will not get away with ease.

{{main|M1919A4 (7.62 mm)}}

To compensate for the lack of continuous firepower against infantry, TCM-20 installed a M1919A4 for the commander to suppress enemies; while it is ineffective against enemy armoured vehicles, there might be some occasions where enemies have exposed crews and the .30 cal could make short work of them.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.

For players who have played the [[M13 MGMC]] in the US tech tree, it can be said that the TCM-20 is an successor to M13 to some extent, especially with its iconic twin gun configuration. However, when enemy aircraft get too close, they will find out the major difference: they would soon be shattered by the 20 mm HS.404 autocannons, recalling the memories from being chased by aircraft with these cannons. Such an "upgrade" is very welcomed as the 20 mm calibre is still more than enough to take out strafing fighters with ease, with overall 720 rounds onboard at 120 rounds per load, if players get used to the relatively straight ballistics and not being trigger-happy, the overall efficiency could be on-par with other SPAAs in other tech trees with their respective advantages. Most of all, the M3 chassis ensures that the TCM-20 can get to where it is needed as soon as possible thanks to its 72 km/h top speed, making it a viable option to flank enemies in some occasions; while the 13 km/h reverse speed could still make sure it can retreat to cover if masses of enemies/menacing aircraft rushing to where the vehicle is. As said, TCM-20 is still a half-track based SPAAG with minimal protection; in fact rifle-calibre firearms can harm the crew at around 200 m from the sides, let along HMGs and autocannons at even higher penetration, so be extra careful on where players should appear - rushing or running into a heated frontline is certainly a death sentence to the TCM-20. Overall, the TCM-20 is still a good AA half-track to handle different types of vehicles, whether it's on wheels, tracks or flying ones.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

'''Pros:'''

* Devastating 20 mm autocannon which works well against aircraft
* Rather mobile, can swiftly changes its position if needed
* Quick turret traverse speed for target acquisition
* Spare .30 cal machine gun for occasion unprotected crews of enemy vehicles

'''Cons:'''

* Lightly protected up to rifle calibre firearms, also prone to overpressure
* Relatively small ammo pool per load (60 per gun)
* Insufficient penetration due to the battle rating

During the 1960s, Israeli engineers took to modifying the American M45 anti-aircraft turret in service with the IDF at the time, in order to increase its effectiveness against fast modern aircraft. As a result, the engineers replaced the original quadruple 12.7 mm machine guns with a pair of HS.404 20 mm cannons salvaged from obsolete French jet fighters of the IAF. This new anti-air turret became known as the TCM-20 of which several hundred were converted from the original M45 design.

As the anti-air platform was just a towed turret, the IDF began to seek ways of increasing its mobility. The answer was to equip the turret to light armored vehicles in service with the IDF at the time. After some initial models were fitted to captured Soviet vehicles, a more permanent solution was found in equipping the widely used M3 halftrack with the TCM-20 turret.

After entering service with the IDF in 1969, TCM-20 immediately had its baptism by fire by taking part in the ongoing War of Attrition. The TCM-20 SPAAG also took part in the subsequent Yom Kippur War as well as in the Invasion of Lebanon in 1982. During the latter conflict, the vehicle also saw extensive use in the ground support role. Following the introduction of more advanced SPAAGs into IDF service, TCM-20 was slowly being phased out of IDF service before ultimately being retired in the early 1990s.
