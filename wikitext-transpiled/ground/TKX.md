== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

Developed soon after the [[Type 90 (Family)|Type 90]] to supplement and replace the aging [[Type 74 (Family)|Type 74s]] and [[Type 90 (Family)|Type 90s]]. The TKX was designed between 2002 to 2009 until it was adopted in service in 2010 as the [[Type 10]]. Its primary function was to be lighter than the [[Type 90]] with an equally effective armour, to access most Japanese infrastructure without hitting the weight limit and a bigger emphasis on {{Annotation|C4I|command, control, communication, computer & intelligence}} which couldn't properly be fitted into the [[Type 74 (Family)|Type 74s]] and [[Type 90 (Family)|Type 90s]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Rack 2 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 14 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 1.
* If you pack 15&nbsp;''(+20)'' shells, it will keep the hull empty of ammo.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 1 into rack 2. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.
