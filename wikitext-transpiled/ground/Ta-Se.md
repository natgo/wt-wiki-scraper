== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Experimental Anti-Air {{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|試製対空戦車 「タセ」|Shisei Taikū Sensha [Ta-Se]}}) was a prototype anti-air vehicle to mechanize the [[Type 98 (20 mm)|Type 98 20 mm cannon]] for armoured companies. Early during the design phase, the easy-to-produce [[Type 94]] anti-air truck was developed and took away the priority of further developing the Ta-Se. The Ta-Se was supposed to supplement the Type 98 [[Ke-Ni]] and replace the Type 95 [[Ha-Go]]; however, it was not formally adopted. In the end, the Army decided it was easier to maintain Type 98 cannons towed behind trucks or use the Type 94 truck as a flatbed than having to adopt and mass produce anti-air tanks to move the same anti-air guns.

It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]]. Capable of dispatching airplanes as well as it can destroy tanks, the Ta-Se does it quickly; Being built on top of the [[Ke-Ni]] chassis, it maintains its zippy manoeuvrability and thin armour. Crew survivability isn't the best for 3 crew members, with 2 sticking out in the turret, though it can get lucky losing a crew member and continue the fight unlike its German counterparts the [[Flakpanzer I]] and [[Flakpanzer 38]] only crewing 2 men.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
It shares the same chassis as the Type 98 [[Ke-Ni]], very thin armour in favour of speed, with a modified open-top turret to be converted as an SPAAG.

'''Armour type:'''

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and tracks are both 15 mm thick.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

As mentioned, the Ta-Se is built on the Type 98 [[Ke-Ni]] hull, which is a very manoeuvrable platform.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}} - This belt can fulfill both roles until the others are researched.
* '''Type 100 HE-T:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer}} - These are best in the AA role but have no effect on enemy tanks except lightly armoured or open-topped vehicles.
* '''Type 100 AP-T:''' {{Annotation|API-T|Armour-piercing incendiary tracer}} - These are best against enemy tanks at close range and do good damage to planes. Concentrate your fire on weak spots like the sides and the rear.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Ta-Se is a fast turreted SPAAG armed with a 20 mm autocannon. It can serve both as an AA or, in urban/small maps, as a close-quarter flanking vehicle. With a fair 24 hp/ton ratio (fully upgraded), the Ta-Se has enough mobility to follow other light tanks. Its light weight makes breaking through obstacles a bit challenging, but, its canon can break most of them before making contact. With fairly narrow tracks, this vehicle is easily slowed down by rough terrain.

One big downside to being such a fast and versatile vehicle (both AA and AT) is that armour is very light at an average of 12 mm. This means you won't survive any shot bigger than MG fire: play smart and always flank, strike fast and retreat at the littlest threat (arty, other enemy tank, strafing plane, etc.). Since two out of three crew members are located in the turret (with their head popping out of it), do not expect to survive any more than one shot.

'''AA role''':

While not being the best rank 1 AA autocannon (this title belongs to the German [[Flakpanzer 38|Flakpanzer 38(t)]] Gepard), this little gun is still very suitable to engage planes.

Shooting at aircraft, you can make use of its manoeuvrability to evade enemy bombs or bullets. This is not a spectacular AA since it's fire density is not so great, requiring every shot to be pinpoint on target to hit. Bring 5-6 full HE belts (API works aswell offering high fire chance) to take this role in case there is planes coming your way. Any good SPAA tactic works fine with the Ta-Se.

'''Light brawler''':

Any aggressive player will greatly enjoy taking this little brute into a close quarter fight. Its fast speed and turret turning rate allow for intense action and multi-target engagement. At this BR, 45 mm of penetration is more than enough to incapacitate most enemy tanks. But beware of its limited ammo count and always engage your target with a fully loaded magazine. It is recommended to spray the gunner first and then taking your time to snipe every other crew member. Whenever an artillery strike is coming your way, be it friendly or enemy, do not stand there for too long since a single shell can wreck this tank. One last warning: never engage heavy targets, instead: ''flee''.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* More armoured than the [[Type 94]] (can survive MG fire)
* Good manoeuvrability and speed
* Fast turret turning rate
* Tiny. Can easily conceal itself and wait for the perfect time to take out enemy aircraft
* 20 mm autocannon is more than enough to take out planes at its BR and API-T belt can even take out light tanks and medium tanks from the side.
* 20 magazines of 20 bullets each.
* Good default multi-purpose belt.
* Fast reload speed

'''Cons:'''

* Same single-mounted 20 mm autocannon as with the [[Type 94]]
* Turret crew members still vulnerable to air attacks and artillery strikes
* Only 3 crew members, two of which are in the turret
* Loader and commander are exposed from the turret.
* Low firing rate and dispersion, which can lead to poor performance against fast and tiny fighters
* Very thin armour makes it vulnerable to almost every enemy

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

In 1941, Japanese command ordered armoured self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. The new vehicle was supposed to be based on a [[Ke-Ni|Type 98 Ke-Ni]] tank chassis and had a 20 mm canon. The vehicle had a Type 100 air-cooled diesel engine with an output of 96.9 kW. After testing the vehicle, it was decided not to put it into series production, so only one Ta-se was built.
