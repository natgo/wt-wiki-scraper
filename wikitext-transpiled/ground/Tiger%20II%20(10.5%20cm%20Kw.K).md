== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' ([[Abbreviations#.28DE.29_Sd.Kfz._Index|Sd.Kfz. Index:]] '''Sd.Kfz. 182''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced to the main tree during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before [[Update 1.41]] as a main tree vehicle, however, as of [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]] it was shifted to become a gift vehicle for players who previously owned it. Increasing Tiger II's main cannon to a whopping [[KwK L/68 (105 mm)|10.5 cm cannon]], the Tiger II (10.5 cm Kw.K) boasts a much more powerful armament than any of the preceding German heavy tanks.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The armour on this variant is the same as on the regular Tiger II (H). The upper front plate provides excellent protection against any regular AP (APCBC, APHE etc.) shell you might face. The turret, however, is only 185 mm and easily penetrated by most enemies, but you can make it very difficult to hit by "wiggling" the turret left and right which will often result in bounces or non-pens. The lower glacis is a weak spot but the transmission right behind it often takes most of the shrapnel, it can catch fire pretty easily though, meaning researching FPE should be done as soon as possible.

'''Armour type:'''

*Rolled homogeneous armour
*Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Cupola, driver MG port)

'''Notes:'''

- Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick while tracks are 30 mm thick.
- Some part of the turret side have track links on them, which gives an additional 30 mm of protection to the armour.
- The weak spot is the front of the turret (185 mm), but it is small and very difficult to hit at mid-long ranges, where it is also harder to penetrate.
- Machine gun port could be marked as a close-range weak spot. Although most of it is still 150 mm thick, the angling is much worse.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This tank's best role is as a sniper/support tank. Stay at distance, or your reload time and mobility will be the death of you.

Use your mobility to reach sniping zones and wait for enemy tanks to show up. Keep your distance to maximize the effectiveness of your armour and use cover to reload without having to worry about being destroyed. Avoid close combat as much as possible since most of the other tanks at your battle rate can penetrate your armour very easily and your reload rate is 20 secs so if your shot doesn't penetrate you will be easily killed.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Armed with a 105 mm gun that rivals the American 105 mm gun found on the [[T29]], [[T28]], and [[T95]]
- Really good ballistic properties on the default APHE round, making it fantastic at long range sniping or shooting at moving targets
- Due to the high TNT load of the default APHE shell, shots that penetrate an enemy's crew compartment almost always leads to an instant kill
- Once fully upgraded, the 10.5 Tiger II's engine is even better than the one found in the [[Tiger II (H) Sla.16]]
- Upper front plate still borderlines on being impenetrable with the exception of inbound APDS and HEAT rounds
- Lower plate susceptible to penetration, however, the transmission stands a good chance of absorbing all the potential damage
- Runs with a 6-man crew. Knocking out the tank with a single shot is difficult to achieve unless the ammo is hit
- Armed with a 12-shot, semi-automatic smoke grenade launcher

'''Cons:'''

- The sides of the turret now have a two ears that can be penetrated, making the turret even worse than the one on the Tiger II (H)
- Sluggish main gun reload time of 15 seconds, so snap-shooting or engaging in brawls is ill-advised
- Despite being quick and manoeuvrable for a heavy tank, do not expect to outmanoeuvre any medium which may be on the battleground
- As long as the tank carries at least 2 shells, there's always ammo stored in the back of the weakly armoured turret

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

===Tiger II===
The ''[[Tiger II (H)|Tiger II]]'' with its 8.8 cm KwK 43 cannon was one of the most formidable tanks in World War II. Its 150 mm thick front armour plate sloped was never penetrated by an Allied tank throughout the war and its cannon could destroy any Allied tank fielded in the war. However, some German higher-ups believe that the armament on the Tiger II was just not enough, something more was needed.

===Concept===
Ideas of rearming the Tiger II was brought up by Krupp in sometime in late 1944. The concept drawing Krupp made was for the Tiger II to be rearmed with a 10.5 cm KwK L/68 cannon. This design would require new mountings and new mechanical parts to be optimized for the larger 10.5 cm gun. While the idea was indeed a very interesting one to up gun the Tiger II, it was never implemented because of its drawbacks. The 10.5 gun uses two-piece ammunition, which requires the presence of another loader. This is impossible because the turret is already cramped as is with three people inside, and the addition of another will make the interior a very miserable place to be in. Plus, the fact the gun's ammunition is two-piece already means that the drawback behind this upgrade is a much slower fire rate. This causes the concept to be rejected by German high command, and if it wasn't, it certainly ended with Germany's surrender in May 1945.

No prototypes were made and its existence is only proven by a concept drawing.

This project was commissioned to improve the combat capabilities of the tank with a boosted fuel-injection Maybach HL230 engine with a power of 900 hp and an improved transmission. The designers of the company Henschel proposed the engine to be used for further production and also installed on Tiger II tanks which had already been produced, but the engine's production was prevented by the deterioration of the German economic situation. The tank was to be armed with the new 105 mm 10,5 cm KwK L/68 gun, equipped with a stabilizer. The gun would have used an automatic ammunition feed. The turret was equipped with a Zeiss stereoscopic rangefinder and a ventilation system. The vehicle was equipped with a crew compartment heating device. The tank's ammunition capacity was increased by 12 shells, thanks to an additional rack mounted inside the turret. A crew of 5-6 operated the tank, whose combat weight was 70.5 tons.

Production on the new Tiger II project, featuring the 10,5 cm KwK L/68 gun, was never launched.
