== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]].

The representation of captured Arab T-54 in Israeli service, Tiran 4 provides the same firepower and mobility of a T-54 while still suffering from the same cramped interior space, downgraded anti-aircraft machine gun, unprotected ammo racks, and slow turret traverse speed.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

Since the Tiran 4 is mostly identical to the original T-54s other than its machine guns, the overall appearance is basically the same as well. While the armour is sufficient to stop most full-calibre kinetic shells, it might not be enough to survive HEAT, APDS, or even APFSDS at higher tiers. Another problem is the unprotected ammo rack located on the right side of the hull, any penetrating shots that hit the remaining ammo will certainly blow the tank sky-high.

'''Armour type:'''

'''Notes:''' <!-- Any additional notes which the user needs to be aware of -->

<!-- Example: * Suspension wheels are 20 mm thick, tracks are 30 mm thick, and torsion bars are 60 mm thick. -->

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

Due to the lack of resources during the wars, Israeli didn't replace the powerplants and retained the same V-54 engine for its reliability; while this doesn't make Tiran 4 a fast tank, it is still able to keep up with teammates.

Due to the logistical reasons, all Warsaw Pact small-calibre firearms were replaced by US-made M1919A4s, which are only good for gunning down exposed crews; the chances of shooting down any aircraft are minimal.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Powerful 100 mm gun with a variety of ammunition
- Sufficient speed and mobility at its rank
- Sufficient protection

'''Cons:'''

- Having only a M1919A4 as pintle machine gun
- Slow turret traverse speed
- Unprotected ammo rack

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

As part of the Cold War and long-lasting Jewish-Arab conflicts, the Soviet Union sold many T-54 and T-55 to Syria and Egypt as part of their military sales. While the reliability of these tanks was proven throughout the conflicts, during the 1967 Six-Day War and the sequential Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israel captured at least 300 T-54/55/62 series tanks during these two wars to resupply their heavily devastated armoured corps, dubbed "Tiran" (lit. "Tyrant") in Israeli service. Captured tanks were dubbed Tiran 1/2/3 for T-54/55/62 respectively, while Tirans which received some logistic modification were designated Tiran 4/5/6 instead. Israel used some of these tanks with their original Egyptian markings to cause harassment behind enemy lines along the Suez Canal.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/08/10/Israeli-division-of-captured-Soviet-tanks/7901524030400/</ref>
