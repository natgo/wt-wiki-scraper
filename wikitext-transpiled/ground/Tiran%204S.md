== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
During the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli Wars, Israel was able to capture a number of Soviet-supplied [[T-54 (1951)|T-54]] tanks from opposing nations, which were slightly modified and redesignated as the [[Tiran 4]]. These were upgraded during the 1970s to equip the American 105 mm M68 cannon, shared by other Israeli tanks, becoming the '''Tiran 4S''' variant.

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the Tiran 4S plays similarly to the Soviet [[T-54 (1951)]] and Chinese [[Type 59]], and is therefore not vulnerable to the shot-traps of earlier models. However, the new gun grants unique gameplay options with options for APDS, HESH, HEAT and Smoke shells. It will offer a fresh experience compared to the Soviet and Chinese T-54s.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Being a near perfect copy of the [[T-54 (1951)]], the Tiran 4S offers very good protection. It is able to survive all solid shot rounds, but offers no protection against HEAT-based options, leaving it weak in that aspect, especially at its battle rating where this type of ammunition is the norm.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola)
* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Tiran 4S combines the mobility and armour of the T-54 series of tanks in the USSR tree and the 105 mm M68 in the US tree. However, it comes with a caveat, the Tiran 4 and Tiran 4S have a significantly slower turret traverse at 5.9°/s. This limitation is somewhat exacerbated by the lack of stabilization on the Tiran 4 and 4S as the gun can be moved much faster by moving the hull in the same direction the gun is traversing. Most of its peers at its BR range have stabilizers which puts the Tiran 4S at a disadvantage. Furthermore, the front ammunition rack is only covered by a small fuel tank in the side and front. Any piercing shot from a high penetration shell or anti-tank guided missile that passes through the fuel tanks will guarantee an ammunition explosion. Unfortunately, the front ammunition rack is the first stage ammo rack thus it is impossible to leave it empty.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Adequate mobility and agility
* Access to the M68 105 mm cannon with APDS, HESH, and HEAT-FS ammunition
* Excellent protection against solid shot shells and smaller calibre APDS ammunition

'''Cons:'''

* Poor turret traverse
* Low gun elevation
* Unprotected ammo rack

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Tiran 4S is an upgrade to the captured T-54s in Israeli service. The "S" in the Tiran 4S stands for "Sharir", which was the name of the 105 mm M68 gun in Israeli service. Aside from storage and logistical modifications to the vehicle, the M68's loading system was also redesigned in part due to the T-54's loader being seated on the right of the gun and the M68 being designed to be loaded from the left. Another modification added to the Tiran 4S was the replacement of the hydraulic gun drive with an electrical gun drive similar to the Sho't tanks in service. The hydraulic gun drive was deemed too dangerous by the IDF as penetration of the gun drive caused hydraulic lines to snap and release hydraulic gases inside the crew compartment that would inflict burns and incapacitate the crew, a lesson learned from the Magachs in the Yom Kippur War. The electrical traverse caused the turret to be more cramped and the turret rotation was made slower but was generally safer.

The Tiran series and its variants, while not used as extensively as the Magach, Sho't, and Merkava series of tanks, continued to serve in the IDF well into the 1980s.
