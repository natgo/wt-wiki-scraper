== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Ixwa Strike"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season III, "Strength athletics"]].

The Toldi IIA is a light tank of the Landsverk L-60 family, a license-built Hungarian variant of the [[Strv m/38]], sporting a 40 mm 37/42M gun and better armour which allows it to stands its ground, but shares the same weaknesses as its Swedish counterpart.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The hull of the Toldi IIA is practically identical to the [[strv m/40L]]'s one. It is a very resistant hull at this battle rating, able to bounce back several rounds if angled correctly. In terms of survivability, this vehicle does not perform well: ammo racks are positioned on the sides of the hull, which is a benefit against frontal shots but a disadvantage against side shots. The crew compartment is tight, a well-aimed shot in the  center of the vehicle will knock it right out.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

The Büssing NAG L8V/36TR is an engine capable of delivering 155 horsepower and manages to take the Toldi IIA to a top speed of 47 km/h. Unfortunately, the reverse is not as good, at only -5 km/h. This engine manages to make the Toldi IIa maintain a constant speed of at least 35 km/h on any terrain. The chassis is great for driving on all types of terrain that can be found in the game: sand, snow, mud and dirt.

The main armament of the Toldi IIA is a 40 mm 37/42 cannon that can fire 3 different types of projectiles, HE, APHEBC, APBC. It is recommended to use the APBC 43M shell as it is the most powerful: at its battle rating is an excellent shell.

{{main|34/40M (8 mm)}}
The Toldi IIA has a coaxial 8 mm 34/40M machine gun, excellent for eliminating the crew of open-topped vehicles such as SPAAs and SPGs. However, it is not very useful against more armoured tanks because it fails to inflict any damage.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Toldi IIA is a very versatile light tank good for any situation on the battlefield. With its good speed, it can change positions effectively and quickly and with its decent mobility, it can afford to go and capture points first. With the limited protection of Toldi IIA, it is recommended to adopt a playstyle more focused on spotting enemies and supporting fire for allies. But for more dynamic players, it can be used as a frontline vehicle to capture the points in the first line and help the advance of allies.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very short reload
* Shells have effective penetration
* Good armour
* Good mobility and handling

'''Cons:'''

* Shells may struggle against heavily-armoured tanks
* Flat upper front armour plates are noticeable weak points

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

After defeat in World War I, Hungary, like Germany, was prohibited from having its own army and armoured vehicles. However, like Germany, this ban didn't hold Hungary back for long. After purchasing small batches of Italian and German tanks, the Hungarian government announced its intention to select a foreign tank design to be deployed at domestic facilities. As a result of tests, preference was given to the Swedish light tank Landsverk L-60, which later entered service with Sweden under the designation Strv m/38. The tank was adapted to the types of guns and sights available to Hungary, the turret was slightly modified and launched into series under the name 38.M Toldi. The first series of Hungarian light tanks, built before April 1940, actively participated in combat - including heavy battles on the Eastern Front, where it showed itself completely indefensible against Soviet medium and heavy armoured vehicles. After two modernizations, the protection on the gun mantlet and the frontal projection of the hull was strengthened, and the 40mm cannon became the main weapon. Now the tank was completely produced from Hungarian components, but with the increased protection and increased calibre, the weight of the vehicle also increased, which subsequently affected its movement performance. Despite all efforts, the upgraded 38.M Toldi II and IIA tanks could no longer compete with the Soviet tanks of the second half of the war. Almost all tanks in the series were lost in battles or by technical failures, the last Toldi were destroyed in the battles for Budapest. The only surviving 38.M Toldi IIA tank is currently on display in the Patriot park near Kubinka, Moscow region.
