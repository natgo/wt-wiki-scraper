== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Hungarian medium tank {{Battle-rating}} in the Italian research tree. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] as part of the Hungarian branch of the Italian tech tree.

The Turán I was a Hungarian medium tank of World War II. Due to being forbidden from developing tanks after World War I, Hungary was still new to developing their own medium tanks from scratch. Therefore, the Turán I was originally based on the Czechoslovak Škoda T-21 medium tank prototype, which the Hungarians first developed into the T-22 design, before accepting the T-22 into service as the Turán I. The Turán I featured a redesigned turret, hull, and suspension, as well as a Hungarian 40 mm cannon and Hungarian 8 mm machine guns, increased armour protection, smoke grenades, and other changes. The [[Turan II|Turán II]] and [[Turan III|Turán III]] Hungarian medium tanks were developed from the Turán I. The Turán I became the backbone of Hungary's tank forces early in WW2, serving on the Eastern Front alongside the [[Toldi IIA|Toldi]] series light tanks and later the [[Zrinyi II|Zrinyi]] series tank destroyers, as well as some German-supplied tanks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The main advantages of the '''{{Specs|name}}''' are its fast reload speed and wonderful gearbox allowing it to reach the same speed forwards and backwards.

This allows you to turn your tank around and drive backwards, effectively protecting your hull crew by having the entire engine and transmission take incoming fire instead of your crew. Moving backwards, your engine will absorb all shots to the hull. Keep in mind however, that the turret armour is not great, and shots penetrating it can still kill all the crew inside.

With the reload speed being at around 3 seconds, it is advised to use APBC (once unlocked) instead of APHEBC, since it has more penetration and the reload speed allows you to quickly finish an opponent that could have survived the first shot.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast firing gun
* Good mobility
* Reverse gearbox allows it to retreat from danger quickly, or to reposition itself conveniently
* Shoulder stabiliser gives it a fair advantage when shooting on the move and in close-quarters combat
* 50 mm frontal armour is sturdy against tanks using small caliber rounds (e.g. [[M3 Stuart (Family)|M3]]/[[M5 Stuart (Family)|M5]] Stuart)
* -10° gun depression makes combat in mountainous terrain easy
* 5 crew members and spaced-out ammo racks mean higher survivability
* Has smoke grenades
* Spaced armour side skirts protect the tank from HEAT and HE (to an extent)

'''Cons:'''

* Angling the hull makes some spots no longer angled, making them into weakspots
* Armour is average and can be defeated by tanks with good penetration
* Somewhat low power-to-weight ratio of around 14 makes climbing hills a struggle
* 40 mm cannon performs poorly in combat, as its penetration is insufficient to penetrate most vehicles below its BR, such as the M3 or M22
* Lacklustre turret traverse speed
