== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
''The main advantages of the '''{{Specs|name}}''' are it's fast reload speed and wonderful gearbox allowing to reach the same speed forward and backward.
This allows you to turn your tank around and drive backwards, effectively removing the giant front plate weakspot that allows you ennemies to easily kill all your crew with APHE, or even AP.

Moving backwards, you engine will absorb all shots in the hull. Keep in mind however that the turret armor is not great, and any shot penetrating it will likely kill all the crew inside.

With the reload speed being at around 3 seconds, it is advised to use AP (once unlocked) instead of APHE, since it has more penetration and the reload speed allows you to quickly finish an opponent that could have survived the first shot.''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Reverse gearbox allows it to retreat from danger quickly, or to reposition itself conveniently
* Shoulder stabiliser gives it a fair advantage in close quarter combat
* 50 mm frontal armor is sturdy against tanks using small caliber rounds (e.g. [[M3 Stuart (Family)|M3]]/[[M5 Stuart (Family)|M5]])
* -10° gun depression makes combat in mountainous terrain easy
* Spaced skirts on the sides protects the tank from HEAT (to an extent) and HE 

'''Cons:'''

* Angling the hull leaves a section almost vertical to the direction of threat, becoming a weakspot
* Armor can be defeated by tank destroyers like [[ZiS-30]] and [[Marder III|Marder]] III
* Low power-to-weight ratio of around 13 makes cross country a struggle
* 40 mm cannon performs poorly in ranged combat, as its penetration drops drastically
* Lacklustre turret traverse speed
