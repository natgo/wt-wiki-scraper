== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update "Winged Lions"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VI, "Firepower"]].

The Turán II is a Hungarian medium tank with a powerful rapid firing 75 mm howitzer. The Turán II boasts good mobility, excellent reverse speed and adequate armour protection, making it a well-rounded medium tank worthy of it being sometimes referred to as "the Hungarian MBT".

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Hull and Turret MG ports)
* Structural steel (Side Skirts)

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and tracks are both 15 mm thick.
* The hull sides and turret sides and rear are protected by an extra 8 mm plate to provide protection from HEAT and HE shells.
* The front right side of the turret has one set of tracks acting as add-on armour with a thickness of 15 mm.
* Angling the tank to roughly 37-38° increases the armour of the front plate to 63 mm, however due to the armour arrangement, this allows a section of the side armour to have 30 mm of protection, leaving it vulnerable to most shells from opponents at its battle rating.

The Turan II shares many strengths and weaknesses with other Axis medium tanks at its Battle-Rating, most similarly the Pz.35(t) and Pz.38(t) family of vehicles, which historically it is closely related to.

The Turan is a boxy vehicle, both the hull and turret are mostly made up of nearly vertical plates, frontal hull and turret armour is thickest at 50 mm. As previously noted, slight angling can increase the effective armour of the Turan. The mesh side skirts give added protection against HEAT rounds. However, the armour overall is average for the BR. Playing the Turan conservatively can maximize survivability as the armour can be defeated by many other vehicles at this BR. The crew of five helps survivability, but they are somewhat close together, and the shells are placed all throughout the tank, including the turret, increasing the chances of getting ammo racked.

The Turan has deceptively good mobility for a tank of its size and armament. It has a decent acceleration and top speed, and a great reverse speed. The hull and turret traverse are both average. Using the Turan's mobility to find good flanking locations pairs well with its relatively quick reload and good gun depression. The 75 mm cannon has a lower velocity and three different shells. The HEAT shell is clearly the superior round with up to 90 mm of penetration at any range. The APHE can inflict more post-pen damage but at the cost of a drastic drop in penetration, less than half that of the HEAT round. The HE round doesn't have many practical uses, as the HEAT round often is sufficient to overpressure certain vehicles.

A decent acceleration and top speed, and a great reverse speed. Hull and turret traverse are average. Using the Turan's mobility to find good flanking spots pairs well with its fast reload and good gun depression.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Short reload time
* Fairly mobile for its size and weight
* Quick and responsive reverse of -43 km/h
* Can bounce shots with a bit of angling

'''Cons:'''

* Struggles in an uptier
* Large profile
* Cramped turret, a penetrating shot often takes out the whole crew
* Littered with ammunition
* Angling too much presents a flat target for the enemy to shoot at, due to the shape of the hull
* Slow turret traverse

[[File:Turan II History.png|thumb|Turan II during tests]]
At the beginning of the 1940s, the Hungarian military decided to develop its own medium tank on the basis of the recently developed Czechoslovakian T-21 medium tank prototype. After one test unit successfully passed initial trials in Hungary, several changes were made to the design, including the fitting of a Hungarian 40 mm cannon as well as increased armour protection. The resulting T-22 design would then be officially accepted into Hungarian service as the 40.M Turán in November 1940.
[[File:Turan II History II.png|thumb|Turan II tanks before battle]]
An initial order of 230 Turán Is was issued in September 1940, but production ended up being delayed by several months due to incomplete technical documentation. Production started only in March 1941 after Škoda supplied the complete technical documents, with the first 40.M Turán I rolling off the assembly line in July 1941. However, before even the first vehicle was constructed, the Hungarian General Staff realized the need for upgrading the vehicle and thus formulated the specification to upgun the Turán with a 75mm gun. However, as no such gun could be developed by Hungary at the time, a WW1 field gun was selected to be modified for tank use.

This undertaking was successful, though it required the Turán's turret to be enlarged slightly. The first prototype of this modification, which became known as the 41.M Turán II, was built in January 1942 and entered service in May. In total, around 195 Turán IIs were constructed until 1944. Today, only a single example of the Turán II survives and is on display in the Kubinka Tank Museum in the vicinity of Moscow.
