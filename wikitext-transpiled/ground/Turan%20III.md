== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Turan III was developed from the [[Turan II|41M Turán II]] Hungarian medium tank, as Hungary needed tanks that were able to better deal with the well-armoured Soviet [[T-34 (Family)|T-34s]] and [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1s]] that Hungary was fighting on the Eastern Front. The Turán III was equipped with a long barrel 75 mm 43.M gun that could effectively deal with the well-armoured Soviet tanks, unlike the short barrel 75 mm gun of the Turán II. To house this large and powerful gun, the Turán III had a new, larger turret. The Turán III also had significantly more armour than the Turán II.

Introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a serious upgrade over the Turan I. It shares some important characteristics with the Panzer IV H, and its playstyle is also rather similar. It has access to a very powerful gun for its BR which allows the Turan III to face even Soviet heavy tanks like the KV-1. The vehicle's powerplant was also upgraded, featuring excellent mobility for a medium tank, including full reverse speed at maximum 48 km/h, which is great for hit and run tactics. It still features the same armour plates and smoke grenades as the Turan I, which allows for higher survivability. However, the reload speed is rather poor at 7.6 seconds when stock, it has a very large profile, and the commanders cupola is an important weak point to keep in mind. The armour, while upgraded, is not enough to stop most 76 mm or even 57 mm guns around its BR, so it should be used in a passive playstyle.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Powerful gun; can easily destroy any target it faces with one well-placed shot
* Gun is quite stable, making firing on the move easier
* Good gun depression
* Excellent mobility
* Incredible reverse speed; can reverse as fast as it can go forwards
* Has smoke grenades
* Has mesh side skirt armour on the turret and hull which protects against HEAT and HE projectiles
* Armour can be surprisingly effective, despite not being particularly thick
* 5 crew members and spaced-out ammo racks mean higher survivability

'''Cons:'''

* Large profile
* Turret traverse speed is not very fast
* Armour is not very strong and reliable
* Only 32 rounds of ammunition means you may run out and need to replenish

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Before production, there were two Turan III tanks built, one prototype, and one fully functional vehicle for testing. The Turan III has not seen too much action in World War II, though, having not been produced enough to make a lasting impact. It is not known if it has ever seen combat. This is because when the tank was developed, Hungary had low resources, and in March 1944, after the invasion of Hungary, the Germans limited the production of tanks.
