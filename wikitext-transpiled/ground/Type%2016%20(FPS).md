== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is an early production model of the [[Type 16]] which belongs to the 14th Brigade, 15th Rapid Deployment Regiment, 1st 16 MCV company.

Introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]] as a pack premium, it comes with the same shells and gameplay as the [[Type 16 (P)]], and the armour of the [[Type 16]]. Being a fast, wheeled vehicle, it can traverse the map at high speeds, using Gen 3 thermals with a laser rangefinder to acquire targets on the fly making quick work on flanks and long range. The Type 16 also provides a laser warning system, which can be used to evade long-range shots if the driver responds to it with the mobility the Type 16 offers on top of smoke grenades which can be used to hide from helicopters.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Composite screen (hull sides and turret front)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

* Fast, with a great acceleration
* Quick turret traverse speed  
* Thermals for gunner and commander sights 

'''Cons:'''

* Weak armour and little survivability
