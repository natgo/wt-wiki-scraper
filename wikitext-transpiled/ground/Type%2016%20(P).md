== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' or more specific '''MCV Prototype No.3 (99-0292)''' was the third out of 4 prototypes towards the [[Type 16|Type 16 MCV]]. It differs from the production model of the Type 16 MCV in some aspects, such as the shape of the turret, the gun mounting, and the chassis. It was tested by the JGSDF from 2014 to 2015, along with the other three prototypes, before the final design was approved and mass production began in 2016.

It was introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]]. Being a fast, wheeled vehicle, it can traverse the map at high speeds, using Gen 3 thermals with a laser rangefinder to acquire targets on the fly making quick work on flanks and long range. The Type 16 also provides a laser warning system, which can be used to evade long-range shots if the driver responds to it with the mobility the Type 16 offers on top of smoke grenades which can be used to hide from helicopters.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|Type 74 (7.62 mm)}}

The Type 16 has an additional 7.62 mm coaxial MG, like most tanks at this tier. It also retains the roof mounted .50 calibre HMG in the American style; this can be extremely effective against light tanks, especially Soviet light tanks like the BMP-1, BMP-2, Object 906, and Object 685. It will easily penetrate them from the side, allowing you to secure a kill if you've only knocked out their mobility.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''''General Playstyle'''''

''Like most light tanks at top tier, you are extremely mobile and capable of pulling off some early flanking attacks on the enemy, weakening them and possibly slowing them down while your MBT allies crawl to your position and mop up any remaining enemy armour. Additionally, the Type 16 possesses an extremely good combination of optics: you have access to both thermals and night vision as well as a nice zoom of 4.0x all the way to 13.3x which makes it an excellent sniper. The Type 16 also provides you with a laser warning system/range finder combo package which makes it easier to tell if you have gained the attention of any enemy tanks during your expedition into the wilderness.''

'''''Realistic Battles'''''

''In RB, it is best to use your speed either to flank the enemy in order to snipe and scout them or reach a nice camping spot in hopes of delaying their advance, ideally near a choke point in the map where they will be bunched up and find it hard to manoeuvre once they notice you, slowing them down just a little bit more. You serve a vital role in matches as any amount of time the enemy team spends dealing with you they also spend ignoring your allies and the capture points, delaying actions should be a priority even above killing as a dead tank can respawn and head elsewhere whereas you need to waste as much of their time as possible, knocking out engines and damaging tracks as well as scaring them via destroying their barrel (which almost always leads to the enemy running back behind friendly lines so they waste time prior to repairing) is all fair game, the more annoying you are the more likely your team will have the time needed to gain the upper hand and win. A final note, this vehicle can if needed brawl for a little while due to its lack of armour and the decently spaced crew layout but it should be your last resort both due to overpressure being an extreme danger and the fact that other light tanks like the BMP family will chew through the sides of the Type 16 with ease and quickly knock out the crew in close quarters. If at all possible, avoid brawling and use your speed to reposition and continue the fight at a distance. On city maps, try to run and get behind the enemy for quick ammo racks and engine fires.''

'''''Arcade Battles'''''

''In AB, your ability to flank is hampered by the different visibility mechanics, so it may be best to put lots of obstacles such as buildings or terrain between you and any enemy tanks while driving around the map in order to avoid this issue until your ready to strike. If the map lacks such terrain features, then you can also resort to acting as a support vehicle and stay with your teammates, using them as armour and providing fire support in addition to providing help with repairing all the breaches that are often damaged during top tier battles. Finally, being a scout tank makes you rather ideal for air support so whenever possible (and when it's safe) use it to help out allies in other parts of the map, your tank is fast but it can't be in two places at once, the air units you bring in can fix that little problem and can provide the much needed assistance your allies were lacking leading to a higher chance of winning the match.''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Fast, with a great acceleration
* Quick turret traverse speed
* 3rd thermals for gunner and commander sights
* Immune to .50 cals from the front
* Decent APFSDS
* Good zoom of 13.3x

'''Cons:'''

* Weak armour and little survivability
* Stabiliser disables at high speed
* APFSDS has little spall
