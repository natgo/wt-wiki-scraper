Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|M2HB (12.7 mm)|Type 74 (7.62 mm)}}

The Type 16 has an additional 7.62 mm coaxial MG, like most tanks at this tier. It also retains the roof mounted .50 calibre HMG in the American style; this can be extremely effective against light tanks, especially Soviet light tanks like the BMP-1, BMP-2, Object 906, and Object 685. It will easily penetrate them from the side, allowing you to secure a kill if you've only knocked out their mobility.
