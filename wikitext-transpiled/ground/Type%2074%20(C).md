== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is among the earliest production variants of the [[Type 74 (Family)|Type 74]], featuring the early ammunition set for the 105 mm L7A3 cannon. It was built up as the production model for Japan's 2nd generation of MBTs to combat tanks such as the [[T-62]] and compare to the [[M60 (Family)|M60]] or [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]], while supplementing and replacing the [[Type 61 (Family)|Type 61]]. While a feature-full tank with hydropneumatic suspension and an effective 105 mm L7A3 cannon, it was a pretty late Gen 2 entry, as the 3rd generation of MBTs (such as the [[Leopard 2 (Family)|Leopard 2]] and [[M1 Abrams (Family)|M1 Abrams]]) would enter service just a few years later.

The most distinctive difference between the {{PAGENAME}} and the subsequent [[Type 74 (E)]] is the lack of a thermal shroud around the 105 mm L7A3 cannon (this feature was introduced in the Type 74 (D) variant).

It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]]. As the earliest of the Type 74s, and has only APDS, HEAT and HESH ammunition. It does not have the APFSDS rounds that the later versions have. It has average mobility and a hydropneumatic suspension system that allows it to adjust its height and angle according to the terrain. It also has a laser rangefinder and a warning system that make it effective as a sniper.

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels and tracks are both 20 mm thick.
* Has additional 10 mm mounting plates scattered on the front hull
* The Type 74's hydropneumatic suspension means it could vary the sloped angle of its armour towards the enemy.
* Hull roof is rated to be 25 mm effective against HE.

As with most medium tanks of the rank, the hull of the {{PAGENAME}} is only capable of stopping some autocannon fire and has very vulnerable sides, however, the turret armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is closer to US and British turret armour level. While it's unlikely to stop most APFSDS, it is very likely to deflect stray APDS and APHE. Light tanks will likely have to get close and personal to penetrate it, as penetrating cupola even with APDS belt is a challenge due to its size.

The advantage can be kept even when creeping onto the enemy high ground by using hydropneumatic suspension before driving uphill to not allow the enemy to fire at the roof. In rare cases, the tank can "duck" behind cover to hide at least a portion of the turret from enemy fire.

While the 105 mm gun is relatively equal to one of other nations. It has all the same shell types of NATO tanks at its BR range. The {{PAGENAME}} also has a laser rangefinder, which makes it really easy to check aim in RB, compared to tanks it fights in down-tiers and sometimes even in up-tier.

The gun depression is somewhat limited at -6°, but the vehicle's hydropneumatic suspension can be used to compensate for this to -12°.

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 2 and 3 are first stage ammo racks. They total 16 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.
** These racks are also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is: 2 - 3 - 1.
** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-8 into rack 9. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.
* The visual discrepancy concerns racks 1 and 3.
** Rack 1 has 3 shells which, while modelled in the rack, are never present (crossed out shells).
** Rack 1 is modelled as 30 shells but contains 34 shells.
** Rack 3 has a shell which remains in the rack even after having been shot.

While it's not recommended, it's still possible to use 12.7 mm to fight light tanks like [[AUBL/74 HVG]] or [[Rooikat Mk.1D]] and most SPAA tanks at <100 m range.

Do not charge them with just the MG, especially at long range, as even poorly armoured rank V light tanks can survive frontal MG fire long enough to disarm and explode Type 74 - let them come to you, hit them with the main gun and ensure they never move again by firing at their sides or flat parts, while hiding yours.

Any melee oriented light tanks like [[BMP-2]] or [[Warrior]] with add-on armour will have enough armour to absorb the MG fire and will greet Type 74 back with point blank ATGM attack, which machine guns will be unable to stop at such range.

== Usage in battles ==

Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
{{Main|Type_74_(E)#Usage_in_battles|l1=Type 74 Usage}}
As all [[Type 74 (Family)|Type 74s]], they closely resemble and play like the [[Leopard (Family)|Leopard 1s]] while providing slightly better protection in exchange of top speed and stock depression, which [[Hydropneumatic suspension]] compensates for up to -12°.

As the earliest in-game production model of the [[Type 74 (Family)|Type 74s]], just coming after the [[STB-1]] it changes up the game with a single shell: M456 HEATFS. While overall gameplay remains the same compared to the rest of the Type 74s, the drawback of only providing HEATFS can be negated by the lower rating of the tank facing against easier-to-punch-through vehicles and less protected vehicles against chemical penetration. All the tools that make the tank shine ranging from laser rangefinder, decent mobility, full stabilizer allow it to as versatile as the tank commander wishes. Allowing for a sniper role in the back of the map, cresting over a hill with the suspension, firing on laser-found ranges or CQB with split-second reaction times allowed by the stabilizer.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* A little bit more agile than the [[Leopard A1A1]]
* .50 cal machine gun proves useful against SPAAGs, as well as strafing aircraft
* Better frontal armour overall than the Leopards, [[ZSU-57-2]] will have a much harder time defeating it from the front, can also bounce some medium tank APDS
* Hydropneumatic suspension system can give up to -12° of gun depression as well as more compatibility for terrain
* Offers laser rangefinder

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks APFSDS
* [[Hydropneumatic suspension]] system takes time to deploy and undeploy
* Only -6° of gun depression without deploying the suspension
* 53 km/h top speed compared to [[Leopard A1A1]]'s 65 km/h (however, both tanks rarely reach this speed)
