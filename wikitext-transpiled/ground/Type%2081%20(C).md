The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is an upgraded version of the Type 81 Surface-to-Air Missile (81式短距離地対空誘導弾) or Tan-SAM (短SAM), a Japanese developed surface-to-air missile currently in service with the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. The development of the Tan-SAM Kai started in 1989 as a intermediate SAM missile was needed between the short-range FIM-92 Stinger & the MIM-23 Hawk missile system, and the upgraded system was designated as SAM-1C in 1995. The Tan-SAM missile has a new phased array active radar seeker that can receive mid-course guidance updates from the Fire Control Systems vehicle. This enhances the missile's range to 14 kilometers, but also increases its weight to 105 kilograms. The missile also has a new smokeless motor with better thrust, replacing the old one. The Fire Control Systems vehicle has a thermal imager to operate better in an ECM-heavy environment.

It was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. The Type 81C can be considered the bigger brother of the [[Type 93]], offering bigger, meaner, and larger both vehicle and missiles. While it's larger, the missile itself still offers great missile guidance with a maximum overload of 35 G, 955 m/s on top of a visual guidance mode which will further increase its hit probability against IRCM/ECM jammers present on high-end helicopters. One problem the Type 81 retains from the Type 93 is the lack of radar, while it offers a thermal camera making the visual spotting of aircraft easier, it still requires situational awareness to find to targets.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Type 81 (C) is a missile launcher mounted on an Isuzu truck that operates from a safe distance behind the front lines. It is not designed for direct combat, but rather for launching powerful missiles at aerial targets. The truck is large and vulnerable, so it should avoid enemy fire by staying in cover or hiding at the edge of the map. The Type 81 (C) has a longer range than the Type 93, but it still benefits from closing the gap to the air threats. To fire a missile, the truck must come to a full stop and wait for 4 seconds to activate the missile. The truck does not have a radar, so it must rely on manual spotting of the targets. The Type 81 (C) has an advantage over some enemies that use IRCM, such as Kamov and Mi-24 helicopters, because it can track them visually without depending on their IR signature (which can be jammed or flared). However, the visual tracking has a shorter range than the IR tracking, so the launcher may lose lock or fail to lock on some targets depending if it uses only visual, only IR or auto mode.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

=== Devblog History ===
In 1966, Japanese engineers began work on developing a new short-range anti-air system capable of intercepting targets beyond fire distance of AA artillery. Furthermore, the new system was envisioned as a modern replacement to dated anti-air systems already in use with the JSDF such as the American M51 Skysweeper and M15A1 SPAAG. In order to fulfill these requirements, the decision was made to mount the missile system onto the Isuzu Type 73 truck chassis.

With development in full swing, the first prototypes had been constructed by the mid 1970s while field trials followed later in the decade. As the test produced positive results, the new SAM system entered service with the JSDF in 1980 under the designation TAN-SAM-1C “Tan-SAM”. However, even after the vehicle entered production, engineers continued tweaking the design, coming up with improved variants by the end of the decade.

The TAN-SAM-1C “Tam-SAM Kai” was one of these variants introduced in 1989, featuring not only improved missiles but also an updated vehicle chassis. This variant entered service with the JSDF in 1995 and continued being produced up until 2006. Thanks to its advanced design and continuous improvements, the TAN-SAM-1C remains in service with the JSDF to this day.
