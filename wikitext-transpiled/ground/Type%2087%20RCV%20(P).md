== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is the prototype stage of the [[Type 87 RCV]] and differs primarily in the turret. While the prototype boasts only a 20 mm autocannon, it does come with an expensive stabilizer which wasn't retained in the main production version.

It was introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]]. Offering the same great mobility as its main production model, its firepower is dampened due to its smaller calibre and is lesser damage and penetration as a result. The safest way to utilize the {{PAGENAME}} is by playing in its intended role: as a reconnaissance combat vehicle. Scout out targets from vantage points, and use the 20 mm purely for self-defence and against softer targets that are doing the same recon role.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
Most of the survivability will result from the lack of armour, most of the vehicle is covered by 10 mm armour with some frontal plates at 20 mm protection. It will be easy to be penalized by machine gun fire if spotted but, if the bullets/shells hit in empty spots from the side, the shells will go clean through without any damage to crew or components.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
As a wheeled reconnaissance vehicle, it is able to get to positions rather fast especially when keeping on roads, allowing for easy flanking and getting on vantage points to scout out the enemy team.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|Rh202 (20 mm)}}

With the armament the Type 87 RCV (P) gets, it's most suitable as a support vehicle that can deal with lightly armoured vehicles and low-flying aircraft. Even the improved APDS belt will lack in damage output due to its small calibre and relatively little penetration at 66 mm.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Type 87 RCV (Prototype) is a specialized vehicle that is designed for reconnaissance and light combat support. RCV stands for Recon Combat Vehicle, which indicates its main function of scouting the enemy positions and engaging targets that are vulnerable to its 20 mm auto-cannon. The auto-cannon can fire at a high rate and is effective against infantry, low-flying aircraft and lightly armoured vehicles such as trucks, APCs and IFVs. However, the auto-cannon has limited penetration and damage against heavily armoured vehicles such as tanks and SPGs. The auto-cannon can only disable the tracks or barrels of these vehicles, but it would require a lot of ammunition and time to do so. Therefore, it is not advisable to use the Type 87 RCV against armoured targets, but rather to report them to the team and let them handle the threat. The Type 87 RCV should be used on wide flanks, where it can exploit its mobility to find advantageous positions and spot out enemy vehicles. It can also destroy or suppress enemy snipers such as ATGM carriers and soft SPGs that are hiding in the rear. The Type 87 RCV should avoid direct confrontation with the enemy, but rather focus on providing intelligence and fire support for the team.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* From the side on:
** Crew spaced out enough to not die in a single shot
** Because of light armour, it is able to take shells without much damage from spalling
* Decent rate of fire
* Great mobility
** Able to reach 100 km/h on roads with ease
** Fast enough to reach 50 km/h off-road
* High-speed gun stabilizer

'''Cons:'''

* Relatively high profile for a recon vehicle
* High chance of getting knocked out by a single shot frontally
* Belts leave much to desire
** Stock HVAP only penetrates 57 mm
** Better APDS only penetrates 66 mm
* Very lightly armoured
* Only 2 reverse gears allowing it to reach -20 km/h
