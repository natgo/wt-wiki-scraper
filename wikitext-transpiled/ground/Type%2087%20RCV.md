== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Reconnaissance Combat Vehicle) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]]. It is nicknamed "{{Annotation|ブラックアイ|Burakkuai}}" (Black-Eye) but is commonly simply referred to as RCV.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

Most of the survivability will result from the lack of armour, most of the vehicle is covered by 10 mm armour with some frontal plates at 20 mm protection. It will be easy to be penalized by machine gun fire if spotted but, if the bullets/shells hit in empty spots from the side, the shells will go clean through without any damage to crew or components.

'''Armour type:'''

- Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof

| Hull || 10 mm (68°) ''Upper glacis''<br>20 mm (31-66°) ''Lower glacis''

|-
| Turret || 20 mm || 10 mm || 4 + 10 mm || 10 mm
|-
| Cupola || colspan="4" | 10 mm

'''Notes:'''

- Wheels are 10 mm thick
- Has some external modules like fuel cans, mud flaps & optics all at 4 mm thick
- Radiators are 5 mm thick

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

As a wheeled reconnaissance vehicle, it is able to get to positions rather fast especially when keeping on roads, allowing for easy flanking and getting on vantage points to scout out the enemy team.

{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

{{main|Oerlikon KBA B02 (25 mm)}}

With the armament the {{PAGENAME}} gets, it's most suitable as a support vehicle that can deal with lightly armoured vehicles and low flying aircraft. Once the APFSDS belt has been unlocked it can deal with most MBTs it faces by shooting out critical components one by one as this subcalibre 25 mm has barely any spalling effect.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

As a wheeled reconnaissance vehicle with only a 25 mm autocannon to use, it's best played in its intended role, spotting the enemy team, using its fast manoeuvrability to flank, and shooting down low flying aircraft. It is best compared to the [[R3 T20 FA-HS]] with the benefits that a light tank gets: scouting and reducing SP for aircraft spawns.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

'''Pros:'''

- From the side on:
  ** Crew spaced out enough to not die in a single shot
  ** Because of light armour, it is able to take shells without much damage from spalling
- Powerful PBM 09 APFSDS round
  ** High penetration, enough to penetrate many vehicles up to 500 - 1,000 m
  ** High muzzle velocity, requiring little lead and little shell drop for engaging targets at range
  \*\* Decent rate of fire
- Great mobility
  ** Able to reach 100 km/h on roads with ease
  ** Fast enough to reach 50 km/h off-road

'''Cons:'''

- Relatively high profile for a recon vehicle
- High chance of getting knocked out by a single shot frontally
- Default belt leaves much to desire
- Very lightly armoured
- Only 2 reverse gears allowing it to reach -20 km/h
