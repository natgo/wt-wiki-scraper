== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is an anti-air truck fitting a [[Type 98 (20 mm)]] on a Type 94 truck. This was done as a measure to get the easiest solution of motorizing anti-air to provide air cover for tank and infantry units alike, without having to develop a whole new vehicle for it. Having the gun already deployed on the back of the truck increases the response time of the vehicle rather than having the gun towed behind it. The wheels of the gun mount are mounted on the back of the cab in case it has to be dismounted from the truck.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 "Way of the Samurai"]] along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree. As with any truck AA, this vehicle is fragile and should not be taken near the frontline, even though it is potent as a frontline automatic anti-tank gun. As a truck chassis, with only 3 crew members, this vehicle has no survivability. Overall, the Type 94 is a gun platform. With 20 bullets, 45 mm of max penetration, a good traverse speed, and reload rate, this gun will shred planes and light targets alike. Plus, the same gun is mounted on the two next Japanese SPAAs, offering a good introduction to this main weapon.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''AA role''':

Shooting at aircraft, you can make use of its manoeuvrability to evade enemy bombs or bullets. This is not a spectacular AA since its fire density is not so great, requiring every shot to be pinpoint on target to hit. Bring 5-6 full HE belts to take this role in case there is planes coming your way. Any good SPAA tactic works fine with the Type 94.

'''Light brawler''':

Any aggressive player will be able to take this truck into a close quarter fight, even if it's not its recommended usage. Its fast speed and gun turning rate allows for intense action and multi-target engagement. In close quarter engagement, come in a reverse position in order to have the best gun arc and always anticipate an escape route. At this BR, 45 mm of penetration is more than enough to incapacitate most enemy tanks. But beware of its limited ammo count and always engage your target with a fully loaded magazine. It is recommended to spray the gunner first and then taking your time to snipe every other crew member. Whenever an artillery strike is coming your way, be it friendly or enemy, do not stand there for too long since a single shell can wreck this truck. One last warning: never engage heavy targets, instead: ''flee''.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 360° gun rotation and fast turret traverse
* Reasonably good penetration can be achieved with the 20 mm AP-T shells (45 mm)
* Truck platform gives good movement on road
* Cabin's back is 15 mm thick, which can block MG fire (if shot from the front, only the driver will die)
* Easy to tow
* Good ammo capacity
* Fast reload speed
* -9° of gun depression and 82° of elevation

'''Cons:'''

* 20 mm rate of fire is low
* Artillery strikes and air attacks can knock out this vehicle very easily
* Absolutely zero armour makes other vehicles able to destroy it by just spraying it with regular machine gun fire and killing the crewmen
* Can be killed by tank ramming
* Commander is standing near the gunner, which makes it very exposed to MG fire
* Can't shoot directly forward, needs to face ground targets side on

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Isuzu Type 94 truck is a Japanese designed truck which was specifically built for military use. Intended to replace civilian designs, it was originally developed in 1933 as part of an Imperial Japanese Army program to sponsor independent motor companies. Unlike its civilian predecessors, these trucks were designed from the outset to be used on rough terrain.

Isuzu's prototype of a 6x4 truck, known in-house as the Isuzu TU10, was first shown to the army in July of 1933. Not only did it have excellent off-road capabilities thanks to its high ground clearance, but it was also very easy to maintain and reliable in use. Originally the type was fitted with an upright 6 cylinder watercooled engine almost identical to that used on the Isuzu Type 93 six-wheeled civilian passenger car, but adapted for military use. It was capable of producing 43 hp at 1,500 rpm or a maximum of 68 hp at 2,800 rpm: this version was known as the Type 94 Ko. Later on in 1939 the DA40, a 6 cylinder diesel engine, was developed for this truck with similar power output but a lower fuel consumption: this version was known as the Type 94 Otsu.

Army trials of the TU10 prototype started in July of 1933, consisting of six different tests in diverse terrains and weather conditions, spread out between July of 1933 and July of 1934. Following the completion of these tests, the type was officially adopted for use by the Imperial Japanese Army as the Type 94. Standardised sets of plans were drawn up by the Army Engineering Headquarters, and full scale production of the Type 94 started in 1937.

The standard Type 94 truck was designed to be operated by a single driver, and could carry either up to 12 passengers - two in the cab, 10 in the cargo bay - or up to 1,300 kg of cargo. Over the course of its production, numerous variants were designed, including the TX40 gasoline-powered civilian 4x4 truck, the Type 97 military 4x4 truck based on the civilian TX40; the TX50 diesel-powered version of the TX40, the TX80 and TU80 with an improved axle strength to increase its maximum payload, as well as various other and specialised variants.

Among these many variants was the '''Type 98 20 mm Machine Cannon Carrier Truck''', which was a ''Type 98 20 mm AA machine cannon'' mounted on the back of a truck as a means to provide AA cover for the IJA's tank divisions. In practice, not solely the Isuzu Type 94 was used, but also equivalent trucks built by Nissan and Toyota.

The Type 98 20 mm AA machine cannon was a Japanese derived variant of the Hotchkiss M1929 13.2 mm machine gun, which had first been developed in 1929 by the French manufacturer Hotchkiss & Cie. Examples of the M1929 were purchased by Japan in the early 1930s, who first started license-building it as the Type 93 machine gun. Experience with the Type 93 and its derived variant, the Type 96 25 mm AT/AA gun, eventually led to a 20 mm variant which was standardised in 1938. This weapon became the most widely spread Japanese light AA gun of the Second World War, with approximately 2,500 built. A variant of the Type 98, the Type 4, was introduced in 1944, consisting of two Type 98 guns on a twinned mount. An approximate 500 Type 4 guns were built between 1944 and 1945.
