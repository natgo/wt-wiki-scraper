== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
While the VBCI-2 (MCT30) exhibits a range of advanced features, a nuanced approach characterizes its survivability. The vehicle's armour, while providing protection against various threats, might be considered less robust when confronted with highly potent anti-tank weaponry. This consideration underscores the VBCI-2's reliance on agility and mobility as key elements of its survival strategy. Additionally, the vehicle's unmanned turret, a notable feature, contributes to its survivability by reducing crew exposure to enemy fire. By leveraging its well-engineered mobility and the unmanned turret, the VBCI-2 can minimize its exposure to potential threats and rapidly change positions on the battlefield. Its ability to traverse diverse terrains efficiently enables it to exploit cover, evade incoming fire, and seek advantageous firing positions. This dynamic approach to survivability, blending mobility with tactical awareness and the advantages of an unmanned turret, allows the VBCI-2 to excel in hit-and-run tactics and swift manoeuvres, proving that a balance between armour, mobility, and advanced technology is pivotal in combat.

The VBCI-2 (MCT30) stands as a versatile and potent asset, with its capabilities extending beyond traditional ground warfare. In armoured combat, the VBCI-2 excels in a range of roles, including reconnaissance, and offensive operations. Armed with the MCT30 unmanned turret, equipped with a 30 mm autocannon and supplementary weapons, it possesses exceptional anti-vehicle capabilities, effectively engaging and neutralizing threats both on open terrain and in urban environments. When facing armoured targets, the utilization of MK258 APFSDS rounds enhances its anti-armour capabilities, penetrating protected adversaries. However, it's important to note that the APFSDS rounds may prove lacklustre when confronting Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) frontally due to their formidable armour. Nevertheless, its ability to target the sides and rear of MBTs remains formidable, potentially resulting in their destruction.

Notably, the VBCI-2's combat capabilities extend into anti-aircraft warfare. The advanced sensor suite, including Infrared Search and Track (IRST) technology and thermal imaging, enables the vehicle to detect and track aerial threats, while its rapid-firing autocannon can engage low-flying aircraft and drones. For engaging aircraft, the use of MK266 HEI-T rounds provides effective anti-aircraft firepower, deterring and countering airborne threats with precision.

Furthermore, the VBCI-2 serves a significant role in mechanized combat as a support vehicle. Its mobility allows it to rapidly manoeuvre across varied landscapes, providing repair assistance to other armoured units. The vehicle's ability to swiftly move through flanks, while offering protective cover and fire support, enhances the cohesion and effectiveness of combined arms operations.

In summary, the VBCI-2's combat uses in armoured scenarios are manifold. It excels in reconnaissance, and offensive roles, owing to its potent weaponry and agile mobility. Its anti-aircraft capabilities offer air defense augmentation, bolstering the protection of mechanized units. Additionally, the VBCI-2's role as a support vehicle enhances the overall effectiveness of mechanized combat operations by providing rapid response, support, and auxiliary functions. Through its adaptability, firepower, and versatility, the VBCI-2 remains a cornerstone of French top-tier armoured forces, capable of fulfilling diverse combat roles in the evolving landscape of warfare.

==== Development ====
In the early 1990s, the French government started the VBM (Véhicule Blindé Modulaire — Modular Armoured Vehicle) as a replacement for its older IFVs. Soon the project caught the attention of Germany and the United Kingdom, nations that were also operating aging IFVs like the German Marder. The first prototype was unveiled in 1996 and was called X8A. However the joint program was abandoned and France continued the project on their own with 700 units ordered in 2000. 

The program quickly advanced, with testings between 2003 and 2004 in agility, mobility and electronics. 5 prototypes were tested under real conditions in 2004 and 2005, the tests resulted in major modifications to the unmanned DRAGAR turret, thus the project was delayed while this issue was fixed. The VBCI was also considered as an APC and a mortar carrier, and was also tested by the British for the FRES program.

==== Service ====
The first batch finished deliveries in 2010, while the second one was delivered in 2012. The IFV has seen some improvements as well as action in Africa, in peacekeeping missions by France in some of their old colonies. In 2014 the first modification pack was unveiled, a 32 ton modification, with more internal volume, redistributed crew and electronics, improved steering and slightly better protection. The French Armed Forces announced their intentions to proccure this vehicle starting in 2015, to this day new units are being delivered or upgraded.

==== Variants and Export ====
The VBCI 2 was the improved variant of the VBCI, with a more powerful diesel engine capable of 600hp, improved crew comfort and new vision cameras. This version was developed mainly for export, the weight was increased to 32 tons and a prototype with a two man turret with a 40mm cannon was tested

The United Kingdom and Qatar showed interest in the VBCI. The UK considered the VBCI for its MIV program, that was meant to replace the aging Warrior IFV, but the Boxer was selected over the VBCI in 2019. Meanwhile, Qatar, who is an important customer of French weapon systems, made public its intentions to obtain 490 Nexter VBCI vehicles. However the lack of unmanned turrets on the market delayed further negotiations. In 2018 however, the turrets were provided by Kongsberg, as well as remote weapon stations in case that the negotiations were succesful.
