== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (English: "Wagon Fire-control AutoCannon 40"), or '''{{PAGENAME}}''' for short, is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 "Viking Fury"]]. The name {{PAGENAME}} follows Bofors naming scheme, not the Swedish army's naming scheme. Its full historical Bofors-name was Bofors VEAK 40 X 60, VEAK indicating type (tracked vehicle with FC-radar and autocannons), 40 indicating calibre (40 mm) and 60 indicating year of design (1960).

[[File:VEAK 40 vinter.png|350px|thumb|left|A {{PAGENAME}} keeping the skies clear over Northern Europe.]]
The {{PAGENAME}} was developed by the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors by request of the Swedish army as a 1960s next generation Swedish SPAA following the 1940s limited production Lvkv fm/43 SPAA and failed 1950s [[Lvkv 42]] prototype SPAA. A single prototype based on the Strv 103 chassis was built and delivered for testing in 1964. The project was delayed at this point but testing commenced and the vehicle proved to be ahead of its time regarding armament and fire control system. This however made the vehicle too costly and in the end the project had to be scrapped due to resources going to the Swedish air force rather than the Swedish air defense.

The {{PAGENAME}} is armed with two 40 mm Bofors L/70 autocannons (Swedish designation: [[lvakan m/48 (40 mm)|40 mm lvakan m/48]]) which each have a fire rate of 300 rounds per minute and are capable of firing proximity-fused high explosive shells which will airburst and damage aircraft when reaching their vicinity. It has mediocre mobility and subpar protection but does feature excellent vertical and horizontal traverse speed for the guns. It also comes equipped with a tracking and search radar that allows the player to find and track airborne targets within a 12 km radius.

=== Survivability and armour ===
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The frontal armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is roughly 15 mm thick all around with very limited sloping angles to back it up. The gun mantlet, roof of both hull and turret, as well as the back are 5 mm thick and vulnerable even to 40 mm HE, as well as 7.62 mm MG at flat angles. 

Heavy machine guns can knock it out by firing at the turret from all directions. The turret is also very big and boxy and also houses all of the vehicles ammunition and crew, thus a shot there usually results in an ammo rack detonation. 

The hull however is fairly empty of components and only houses the transmission and engine which are located in their own compartment, resulting in tons of empty space in the hull under the turret. There is also a small internal screen to protect the turret compartment from stray shots. Attack to the lower hull usually leaves the vehicle combat capable.

The radar is placed too high to let vehicle hide behind a hill line, but it can be turned off and hidden behind the SPAA to reduce probability of a hit.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Cupolas)
* Structural steel (Radar mast, Radar dish, Mud skirts, Suspension)

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
{{tankMobility|abMinHp=767|rbMinHp=478}}
[[File:VEAK 40 driving 1.png|thumb|450px|The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' moving through though thick snow.]]
The mobility of the {{PAGENAME}} is excellent. The vehicle is based on the chassis of the [[Strv 103A]] and features the same transmission and engine (although currently  lacking turbine engine sound) while being 7.9 tons lighter. The engine gives out 540 hp in realistic when fully upgraded, giving this 29 ton vehicle a power to ton ratio of 18.62. This gives the tank great acceleration on shorter distances and allows it to effectively move around the battlefield like the average speedy light tank.

'''Mobility times on flat paved terrain (realistic)'''

*Time to 60 km/h (max effective) forward: > 25 s
*Time to 20 km/h forward: > 2 s
*Time to 18 km/h (max effective) reverse: > 2 s
*Time to rotate 360°: < 8 s

'''Mobility times on flat grass terrin (realistic)'''

*Time to 40 km/h (max effective) forward: < 11 s
*Time to 20 km/h forward: > 2 s
*Time to 18 km/h (max effective) reverse: > 2 s
*Time to rotate 360°: < 8 s

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

;Modification route

*Stage 1 (Primary Route): Like with every tank the first modifications to research can be {{Annotation|Parts|Parts allows for repair of vehicle modules in combat.}} and {{Annotation|FPE|FPE allows for extinguishing of internal fires in combat.}}. 

:After those it is best to unlock the ammunition (slsgr m/484 {{Annotation|HE-VT*|High-explosive variable time fuse (self-destroying)}} and slpprj m/42B {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}). Depending on the desired playstyle you can either go for the HE-VT or AP first. The slsgr m/484 is excellent for taking out aircraft, while the slpprj m/42B is great at taking out tanks in the side.

*Stage 1 (Alternate Route): If you want to actually use the SPAA for its intended purpose (to fight aircraft) then a viable alternate route would be to unlock slsgr m/484 {{Annotation|HE-VT*|High-explosive variable time fuse (self-destroying)}} as your first unlock (before Parts and FPE). This is because even 4 VT shells can easily destroy any aircraft (and may not draw as much attention), while hundreds of default shells might not even hit the target directly, even with accuracy upgrades. This will greatly speed up the research process as well.

*Stage 2: After unlocking Parts, FPE and ammunition you can either go for mobility upgrades or fire-control upgrades depending on the desired playstyle.

:If you desire to kill tanks then go for mobility upgrades such as Filters, Engine and Transmission. This will allow you to easily flank and outmanoeuvre enemy tanks with some planning. 

:If you desire to kill aircraft then go for fire-control upgrades such as Horizontal Drive, Adjustment of Fire and Elevation Mechanism. This will give you one of the best targeting speeds in the game.

*Stage 3: After unlocking enough performance upgrades for comfort then it is viable to unlock Artillery Support. 

:Follow this by unlocking the suspension upgrades: Suspension > Brake System > Tracks. 

:The last upgrade to unlock is Crew Replacement. Due to the limited survivability of the {{PAGENAME}} and its ability to stay fully combat capable without one crew member there is rarely a need to restore a dead crew member.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|lvakan m/48 (40 mm)}}
The {{PAGENAME}} uses two '''Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft autocannon L/70''' guns, in Swedish service designated [[lvakan m/48 (40 mm)|40 mm lvakan m/48]]. These have extremely good stats in all regards. Excellent rate of fire, excellent velocity and excellent effect against both aircraft and tanks. 

The downside compared to 35 mm counterparts is the questionable accuracy. It is also really easy to spend half of the ammunition without even noticing - each gun consumes a clip every 10 shots, but the UI presents it as 20 shots in the same box, which might be confusing. To avoid confusion, always divide current amount of clips by 2.

==== Ammunition ====
The ammunition of the {{PAGENAME}} is excellent for its type. While not perfect in all regards, specific belts do what they are expected to and sometimes more. For example, the effectiveness of {{Annotation|HE-VT*|High-explosive variable time fuse (self-destroying)}} ammunition against aircraft is not to be questioned, with a bonus feature of being able to detonate above open-topped ATGM tanks like the [[Khrizantema-S]] or SAM with spectacular results. The penetration values even of the {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}} ammunition is too low to penetrate any heavy tank, but it can penetrate lighter tanks through weak spots in the majority of situations.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|ksp 58 (7.62 mm)}}
Beyond its main weaponry, the {{PAGENAME}} also features a cupola mounted 7,62 mm FN MAG machine gun, in Swedish service designated [[ksp 58 (7.62 mm)|7,62 mm ksp m/58B]]. This is extremely rare for SPAAs and makes it one of two SPAAs that has a secondary machine gun (the other one being the [[Lvkv 9040C]]). Due to the characteristics of its main weaponry there is rarely a need to use the secondary machine gun, but it can be used when suppressing ATGM carriers or low flying helicopters (as VT shell requires 500 m range to activate and will not disable them at close range).

== Usage in battles ==
[[File:VEAK 40 driving 2.png|thumb|right|450px|Two {{PAGENAME}} driving in a convoy.]]
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The {{PAGENAME}} is a fairly basic tier 5 SPAA. It has a radar and effective anti air guns that will easily take out any aircraft even at longer ranges with ease. The guns also has fairly high penetration on its armour-piercing ammo and will easily take out lightly armoured vehicles in the front and the majority of vehicles in the side. Its protection is more or less non-existent and the {{PAGENAME}} can even be dealt with using regular low-calibre machine guns. In arcade battles, it is one of the earliest anti-air vehicles with VT shells.

When playing the {{PAGENAME}} it is best to stay in spawn and shoot at incoming aircraft, or using the great mobility to follow team-mates into battle and support them with suppressive fire and anti-aircraft support. If there are no aircraft to shoot at then it is viable to cruise around the map at high speeds and hunt lightly armoured targets and capture points. 

Due to the large profile of the turret there are rarely options for hiding behind cover and thus it is best to play aggressively and using your high speed, stabilized guns and high fire rate to defeat enemy tanks. The radar mast retracts behind the turret like on a lot of other radar SPAAs when turned off, allowing you to become slightly less visible. Turning it off may be a good choice, if you are not looking to be spotted as easily if you believe enemies may be nearby. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Twin 40 mm lvakan m/48 cannons are very effective against air units
* Has a lot of meaningful options for ammo belts: 
** Has access to proximity fuse HE shells (earliest in AB)
** Has SAPHEI/HE belt like the early Swedish SPAA to obliterate poorly armoured vehicles and exploit weak spots
** AP belt has 3/1 composition and can penetrate medium battle tanks hulls from the side with some effort given
* Has a pintle-mounted machine gun for maximum suppressing fire, unlike other SPAA
* Radar is a Combined Search and Tracking radar, can track targets through a full 360°, will not randomly alert other aircraft while focusing on one
* Radar folds back when turned off, reducing profile

'''Cons:'''

* Inaccurate and requires VT shells to fight against air efficiently
* Both guns use the same belts, meaning ammo will run out twice as fast than what UI tries to convey
* Very easy to destroy since all the ammo and the crew are located in the turret
* The turret's armour is very thin (only 5 mm covering mantlet, roof and sides)
** Can be taken out by even rifle-calibre machine guns
* Radar has poor range, compared to others of its type, prone to collisions when fighting multiple aircraft in close proximity
* Can be easily spotted due to a large turret profile and tall radar mast
* Engine is very loud, can easily give away your position while moving
