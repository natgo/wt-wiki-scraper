== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "New Power"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The VFM5 has little to no armour protection from anything larger than 7.62 mm rounds, the M2 .50 cal being able to penetrate its sides. The most protected section of the tank is the front of the hull towards the more extreme angles around the driver's ports, which is up to 160 mm of effective thickness, however this is halved by APFSDS, not that it would matter either way. HEATFS is even more effective, the thickness against chemical rounds dropping to approximately 23 mm.

The tank can survive a shot, however shots to the turret have a higher chance, as long as the spalling created by the shell is blocked by the cannon breech. Shots to the left side of the turret (or the right side looking front-on) will likely detonate the ready-rack ammunition. Side shots can be survived as long as they are to the hull due to large amounts of empty space. To increase your chance of survival of side shots, a player should take no more than 30 rounds to ensure the room below the turret is ammunition-free. As one would expect from a tank of this type, taking shots should not be attempted under any circumstances.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list.

'''Pros:'''

* Equips the renowned 105 mm L7 cannon
* Good mobility
* 10X gunner zoom is good for sniping

'''Cons:'''

* Lightly armoured
* Stock HEATFS, a bad thing considering enemies can be well-protected against chemical warheads
* Non-sabot APHE rounds from most SPAA's will ricochet off the hull into the lower turret, damaging or knocking out the turret crew

== History ==

The VFM 5, also known as Vickers Mk.5, was a light tank built by Vickers. It was based on the hull of the American Close Combat Vehicle Light (CCV-L), which was built by VFM, but with a new turret and main armament. It was primarily designed for export.

=== Development ===
The CCV-L was first revealed by FMC at AUSA in October 1985. Vickers Defense Systems and FMC formed a cooperative agreement later that year to design an export version of the tank. It had been designed as a cheaper version of the CCV-L, and it was designated as the VFM 5. After the prototype was completed in 1986, it was displayed at the British Army Equipment Exhibition of the same year. No production orders were received.

=== Design ===
The hull was nearly unmodified from the CCV-L, made of welded aluminum armour with applique steel armour available for the front and sides.

The layout of the VFM 5 was conventional. The driver was located in the front, the fighting compartment in the center, and the engine compartment at the rear.

The driver sat in the center of the front of the hull. His seat was adjustable, with a folding backrest to allow access to the fighting compartment. His hatch was opened by use of hinges on the rear, and it had five periscopes for viewing to the front and sides. When necessary, the center, forward facing periscope could be replaced with a passive periscope for night operations.

The turret is different from that of the CCV-L. The turret had a crew of three, and it was constructed in the same way as the hull, with welded aluminum armour and applique steel plates. The turret was mounted on a high-accuracy low-friction turret ring that is tilted down 3° at the front.

The main armament of the VMF 5 was a 105 mm Low Recoil Force gun, fitted with an integral muzzle break and a rigid thermal sleeve. 41 rounds of 105 mm ammunition were carried. 22 rounds were stored in the front of the hull, 11 on each side of the driver. 19 rounds were stored in the fighting compartment, located below the turret ring. Unlike the CCV-L, the VFM 5 features a loader, rather than an automatic loading system.

A Marconi fire-control system (FCS) is used, which includes computerized fire-control systems and a two-axis gun stabilizer. The turret traversed electronically 360°, while the gun elevated from -10° to +20°.

The secondary armament consisted of a coaxial 7.62 mm L8 machine gun. A total of 2,600 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition were carried in boxes of 200 rounds. Additionally, a 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine gun could be pintle-mounted at the leader's hatch. 500 rounds could be carried if the 12.7 mm machine gun was fitted.

A bank of six smoke grenade launchers was located on each side of the turret, for a total of twelve smoke or fragmentation grenades. They were fired electronically by the bank's commander from the interior.

The gunner's primary sight was a NANOQUEST telescopic sight with a zoom of x10. It incorporated a laser rangefinder and muzzle reference system. The gunner also had a NANOQUEST periscope for wide-angle observation. A thermal imaging system was available as an option.

The commander had a rear-opening, single piece hatch with fiver periscopes. He also had a Pilkington PE/Raven II day/night sight with magnification of x1 and x8, as well as image intensification for night operations.

The loader also had a single piece, rear-opening hatch with a single AFV No 3 Mk 1 periscope with 360° of rotation.

The suspension of the VFM 5 is a torsion bar type. There are six road wheels on each side of the chassis and a shock absorber at each road wheel. 38 cm double-pin tracks are used.

The engine is a General Motors (GM) Detroit Diesel Model 6V-92 TA 6-cylinder, producing 550 horsepower. A General Electric (GE) HMPT-500-3 transmission is used, with three forward gears and one reverse gear. The powerpack is cooled by a water radiator and oil cooler. Easy access to the engine is provided by a rear hull ramp, which the engine can be slid down for maintenance or replacement. Access covers are located on the engine compartment roof for easy maintenance as well.

The engine compartment is protected by an automatic fire-suppression system, and one can also be fitted for the crew compartment. Handheld extinguishers are also provided.

In 1985, Vickers formed a consortium with the American FMC company in order to develop a modern, yet cost-effective light tank for the export market. To achieve this, development and production costs had to be kept as low as possible. As a result, the decision was made to combine the CCVL hull developed by FMC for the US Army's AGS project with a Vickers-built turret, housing a modified low-recoil version of the widely used L7 cannon.

The first prototype was built in 1986 and subsequently revealed to the public at the British Army Equipment Exhibition that year. However, despite its modern equipment, excellent mobility and low weight thanks to the wide use of aluminum alloys, the VFM 5 failed to attract any attention from potential international operators at first.

However, testing and further refinement of the vehicle's design continued into the late 1980's and early 1990's, just at that time negotiations were held with Malaysia to supply the tank to the national armed forces, but it ultimately never came to a production agreement. In the end, only a single prototype of the VFM 5 was ever constructed.
