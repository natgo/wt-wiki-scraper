== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]] as a reward in the [[wt:en/news/6145-special-battlefield-engineer-en|"Battlefield Engineer"]] event.

Also known as the [[wikipedia:Grille_10|Grille 10]], the 8.8 cm Flak 37 auf Sonderfahrgestell (German: 8.8 cm Flak 37 on special chassis), or the abbreviated technical name Sfl.IVc (Selbstfahrlafette: self-propelled gun mount IVc), was originally developed as a mobile gun platform using 8.8 cm Flak guns.

Designed by the Krupp corporation originally as an anti-tank vehicle in 1941, it was realized that by using 8.8 cm Flak cannons, it could achieve not only an anti-tank role but also an anti-aircraft one as well. Because of this, this vehicle was given the 8.8 cm Flak 41 as its main and only armament.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The {{Specs|pseudonym}} has decently high survivability in battle, utilizing its thin armour to great effect. After all,"no armour is the best armour". The vehicle is effective both with side skirts up and down and out of the way. The Versuchsflakwagen does have hull-break, so you have to worry about high caliber HE shells triggering instant destruction of the vehicle.

When the side skirts are in the up position, they will cover the sides of the exposed crew and gun, offering two layers of 5 mm armour, adding up to a total of 10 mm of armour which can protect you from oncoming machine gun fire. They may also prevent damage by shrapnel from artillery barrages that land near, though not directly on your vehicle. However, they will not hold up to a round fired from the main gun of a tank. Fortunately, due to the thin armour, enemy shells may simply pass through without detonating, only doing minor damage depending on where they hit. Its armour is not enough to protect it from high caliber machine guns and autocannons.

With the skirts down, the tank destroyer can easily be disabled due to the exposure of the four crew members to the elements, or the gun being taken out of commission. On the other hand, if the tank, gun, or both are still in action, the front panels of the Flak 41 can be used to block machine gun fire, effectively protecting any crew still remaining to operate the gun. Folding the side skirts down also allows the turret to rotate 360 degrees horizontally.

In both configurations, the crew is very spaced out, and separated by armour into three groups, greatly enhancing its suitability. It is near impossible for an enemy tank to take out all its crew members in a single shot. The loader, gunner, and commander can be killed by a shot to the left of the turret, but both crew members in the driving compartment and the second loader will likely survive so you can escape. The only real danger of the VFW being destroyed in one hit would either be from an ammo rack detonation, which is unlikely as all the ammunition is safely stored in the hull, or from a bomb or artillery landing too close. Beware that its survivability depends solely on crew count and placement rather than armour. In other words, you can easily take one or two hits, but ultimately there is a limited number of shots you can tank before you are sent back to the hangar.

Notes:

- The reloading rate on the following table corresponds to when the {{PAGENAME}}'s "''Side skirts up''" modification is '''uninstalled'''. When it is installed, the reload goes up by 2.1 seconds.

The {{PAGENAME}} is armed with the 88 mm Flak 41 cannon allowing it to disable or destroy a majority of its intended targets at its battle rating. The reload speed of the gun is around 5 seconds which allows for quick and consistent fire upon targets.

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Because of its great cannon and non-existent armour, the VFW is best used as a glass cannon for long range engagements. Find a spot on a hill or slope and wait for targets. If use in urban area is unavoidable, choose the "side skirts down" mode. This makes the cannon more flexible and gives you a quicker reload time. Make sure to stay in cover, since with your side skirts down, you will be an easy target for planes and artillery.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- A very fast reload on a very powerful gun
- Surprising durability, very difficult to one-shot
- Large crew allows for fast reloading
- Reasonable transverse allows for quick escape when in a tight spot
- Side-skirts can be raised for added protection from machine guns
- Side-skirts can be lowered for a greater range of turret movement

'''Cons:'''

- Virtually nonexistent gun depression
- Very thin armour, exposed crew and wide vehicle profile (large target)
- Extremely vulnerable to virtually any form of enemy aircraft or artillery fire
- If side-skirts are raised, turret movement is restricted; an immobilized VFW can only fire at vehicles directly in front of it
- Side-skirts can only be raised or lowered before the start of the game

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The VFW was the first of several projects of the Krupp company to mount a heavy anti-air gun on a mobile armoured chassis. This initially developed version, which mounts the 8.8cm FlaK 41 cannon onto a heavily modified Panzer IV chassis, was created in 1944.

Initial tests of the vehicle were performed throughout 1944. However, apart from tests producing mixed results, it was lacking interest that eventually led to the project's ultimate cancellation later that year. As a result, the VFW never left prototype stage and only a single experimental vehicle was ever produced.

- Due to its box-like shape, the player base gave this vehicle the nickname "Flaktoaster" or just "Toaster"
