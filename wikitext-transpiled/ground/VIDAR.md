== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}'''is a self propelled artillery system employed by Norway since 2022. The system is an export version of the South Korean K9 Thunder Self Propelled Artillery Gun. Norway acquired the system to replace it's aging M109A3GNM from American origin. Norway acquired a total of 24 K9 Thunder artillery systems. The deliveries started in 2019 and concluded in 2021. The system has some differences compared to the South Korean version, like a combined NBC protection and air conditioning situated at the rear of the turret. This system was given to the ''Artilleribataljonen'' of the ''Brigade Nord'', the only artillery unit in the Norwegian army.

Being introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]]. The VIDAR is fitted with excellent optics and fire control system. At it's BR is one of the few vehicles with both thermal imaging system and a laser rangefinder. However, the VIDAR lacks the armour and the rounds to be considered overpowered. It's best round is a HE 155mm shell, that is indeed capable of destroying most tanks but requires very good aiming when it faces heavily armoured targets like the T-55AMD. The vehicle also has a poor turret rotation speed and no stabilizer, and of course, being an artillery system, the gun depression is very mediocre. However, it has good mobility for a vehicle of it's size, and a very good reverse speed of 42KM/h.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The VIDAR has poor protection that doesn't protect against anything heavier than autocannons. It is also susceptible to CAS.

The turret and hull sides are rather flat, so the armour is always at its weakest.

However, due to the insignificant armour, there is a lot of space, so the crew as well as components are very spread out. Survival is not uncommon against APDS and HEAT/HEATFS.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is an export version of the South Korean K9 Thunder Self Propelled Artillery System, in service with the Norwegian Army. Norway decided to acquire a total of 24 K9 Thunder systems as well as 6 K10 resupply vehicles to replace their aging American made M109A3GNM.

The VIDAR is operated by the only artillery unit in the Norwegian Army, the ''Artilleribataljonen'' of the ''Brigade Nord.'' The vehicle was manufactured by the company Hanwha Land Systems, deliveries started in 2019 and finished between 2020 and 2021. All units were considered operative by the Norwegian Army by January 1st, 2022. 

The K9 Thunder, was developed by South Korea, inspired in the American M109 Paladin. The vehicle was meant to be compatible with NATO projectiles and have a good mobility to counteract counterbattery fire and change positions quickly and safely. The K9's first prototype was unveiled in 1996. The contract for it's development was awarded to Samsung Aerospace Industries and just 3 years later in 1999 the ROK Army started to receive it's first units of the vehicle. Strangely, the first nation in acquiring the production rights for the system was Turkey.

The K9 has only seen action in the Yeonpyeong bombardment of 2010, an artillery exchange between South Korean and North Korean soldiers. In this incident 6 K9 systems from the South Korean Marine Infantry opened fire against North Korean positions.

The K9 has received very good export deals. Competing in the international markets with very powerful systems like the American M109 and German Pzh 2000 it has sold more than 1700 units, including those for South Korea. Turkey also has fitted their own version of the system, the T-155 Firtina, with 300 units expected to be deployed.
