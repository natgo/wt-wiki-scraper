== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Défense Contre Avion) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The ATV's DCA armour is weak and will only withstand the MG. Unlike the [[CCKW 353 AA]], its crew is not in the open air but protected by armour, however thin it may be. It is rather small and will hide easily in bushes. 

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

*Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret)
*Cast homogeneous armour (Transmission area)
*Structural steel (Tracks, Additional Armour of 4 mm)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

Based on the AMX-13 light tank, the VTT armored personnel carrier was developed and launched into mass production in 1957. As this chassis was widely produced it became quite a suitable platform for numerous experimental variants, a notable example being the AMX-13 VTT / DCA (Véhicule de Transport de Troupe/Défense Contre Avions). It was armed with an American M45 .50 caliber quadmount, the same found on the iconic M16 Half-track. Unlike the M16 however, the VTT DCA was only a single prototype and didn't reach mass production.
