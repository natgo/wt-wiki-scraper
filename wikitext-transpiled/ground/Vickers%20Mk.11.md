== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. This is more of a sniper tank with abilities of a scout, retaining bus-like behaviour of [[Ratel 90]] and [[G6]], rather than opting for the shock-and-awe fighting style like the [[Rooikat Mk.1D]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The armour of this vehicle should not be relied on.

For the hull, the bulletproof glass in front of the driver cannot stop even 12.7 mm from 500 m away, and the driver compartment is not sealed away from the turret crew, so it's easy to directly machine gun the secondary ammo rack, as well as overpressure the entire tank with anything besides maybe small HEAT-FS from the front. Even the engine seal is not strong enough to protect gunner and commander from big shell debris, so it's entirely up to luck if the tank survives any hull hits at all, even from the front. Since the turret crew sits very high, sometimes the internal screen will prevent 20 and 30 mm autocannons from instantly blowing them up, giving them a split second to turn the gun onto offending light tank / SPAA before they decided to unload into the turret. Due to hull being only 12 mm thick against modern APHE, it usually will not detonate on hull hit unless the commander is exceptionally unlucky and the shell landed at an odd angle. This fact still won't save the turret crew  if APHE flies straight into the turret direction, being fired from low ground or for any other reason.

The turret armour is not much better than the hull. While it's extremely difficult to machine gun it, there are no additional screens and a lot of holes in defences, so in general any SPAA will easily shred the turret crew by firing in it's general direction. Any APDS armed autocannon tank will be able to double tap the tank's turret crew from pretty much any range. Any big explosives will implode the tank here even if they land on engine side of the roof. Even HEAT can implode the tank if they land on the very top of the roof. Should the tank crew survive due to the AB rules or due to extreme luck, there are still irremovable ammo racks in the back of the turret, which can also explode.

The smoke launchers are mounted on the turret and can cover 180 degree sector twice (fire smoke 3 times to do this). It's possible to make a 360 degree smoke by firing smoke while spinning the turret around.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
This tank-truck is about 20% slower than [[Rooikat (Family)|Rooikats]], and offroad it generally drives at 65 km/h. What's good about this, is that it is unlikely to drive faster than its stabilizer can handle in RB, allowing the user to fire on a move without thinking about slowing down. What is bad about this, is that it only reaches advertised speed on roads and thus cannot compete with many light tanks for being first on point, nor is it really faster than any medium tank, much like the Ratels.

The truck has no neutral steering and its turning circle is quite wide, much like with other British wheeled tanks.

Surprisingly, despite its size the tank can swim at 5 km/h speed. It is also extremely stable during this, allowing the tank to accurately snipe off water, which is quite rare.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|LRF (105 mm)}}

The gun is one of the main features of this tank-truck, although it also has its disadvantages. At first it only fires a rather underwhelming HEAT-FS and the default British HESH, but by the end of the research it can carry APFSDS with very high angled penetration, without having to face the tanks that carry the same shells.

The gun cannot aim backwards, so letting enemy behind the truck is not acceptable. If engine was taken out during a drive-by in a city, turning the truck around with its remaining momentum to fire broadside is a decent idea.
 
The HEAT-FS rarely blows up even Soviet fuel tanks completely, so aiming directly at the crew or unprotected ammo racks is recommended at first.

The tank has no thermal scope, so it has to rely on its scouting drone to search for enemies. This drone does have thermal camera, unlike any other light tanks around.

Tank has laser rangefinder, which can be used through commander scope to easily land over hill shots at 700 m range, even off water. Due to the truck being rather tall, it also can fire over more cover than other tanks, though not to a degree of the British ATGM carriers of this era.

Finally, the reload rate is rather slow at 8.7, but the gun is not on autoloader, so by raising the crew skill it's possible to reach about 7.1 reload rate on expert crew and 6.7 on ace crew. Obviously, if the loader is hit or replacing other crew members, then reload rate reduces severely.

By taking out 12 shells (19 left) you can remove the bottom ammo rack, which is generally not going to help much. By taking out another 6 (13 left), you can remove the vertical ammo rack that can be machinegunned by 12.7 mm and/or hit by kinetic shells through the left driver window, making the tank much safer. Do note that the last shell from that ammo rack is loaded into the gun and might appear again if cannon is broken while simultaneously rearming on a capture point.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|L8A2 (7.62 mm)}}

The machine gun can help when using HEAT-FS by removing bushes and flimsy fences, which makes the truck slightly better in some situations than stock [[Rooikat MTTD]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

Against all odds, this tank is a rather good first vehicle on hilly and somewhat open maps. While it doesn't have any armour, players really hate to fire on the move while moving towards their first objective, so on medium to small maps, you can easily send 1 to 3 people back to the spawn while driving to the capture or vantage point of choice simply because the truck is absolutely stable and the gun is easy to aim after minimal practice. This initial assault is particularly effective against teams mainly consisting of Soviet or Chinese tanks, as they are way less compatible with hills due to their issues with gun depression and are unlikely to hunker down and snipe you from the very start. Any other targets can be scouted for free points and cover from your teammates.

After initial encounter, finding a good position to prevent enemies from encroaching around your capture point is generally the best choice. While the truck doesn't have cover abuse ability to an extent seen on the ZT3A2, it can use some shallow ridges as a sniping point instead of cover. Even just parking in the middle of some random river may work (it swims and can snipe!), as nobody will be watching out that kind of ambush. While having nothing to do (or if your teammates ask for it), the scouting drone should be used to evaluate the map situation (if you are driving somewhere, use cruise control to keep the tank driving forward). Since the drone of this tank has thermal vision (no one else has this ability yet), it is extremely valuable and will make finding enemy tanks trivial. If in an uptier, try to avoid losing it to the VT ammunition or to IR missiles of SPAA such as Soviet Strela or German Ozelot.

If extremely bored by passive gameplay, or pushed hard, the tank can even use other tanks as cover to annoy enemy ever harder despite an abundance of APFSDS at the tier that can overpenetrate tanks, since the turret crew is sitting pretty high and the hull is mostly empty if low ammunition amount was taken, so even if enemy obliterates your teammate and hits you as well, you may not even care about it (as most lethal hits will be aimed at your ally, which is generally too low). In fact, it is extremely beneficial to team up with certain tough tanks to become a "double turreted monster" that repairs at ludicrous speeds and double taps anyone with lethal APFSDS before they can even drive out of cover properly. Be wary of any flanks from the side when employing such tactics and remember about your own vulnerability to any chemical shells. Being in a squad with the said teammate will also give you extra spawn points (or bomber points in AB) when they blow up things scouted by you, and being in a voice chat with them, or at least informing them of what you are doing will also increase your overall performance (for example, a person that is not even cooperating with you willingly might backpedal into you instead of letting you repair them, dooming you both, then say mean things about you in chat for "interfering" with their retreat).

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

*Has a laser rangefinder
*Its scouting drone has thermal scope, which is normally only seen at higher rank battles/vehicles
*Generally cannot drive faster than its stabilizer can handle, letting it to retaliate against sudden attacks at any moment
*Very tall and can use some more obscure vantage points, including other tanks
*Technically can survive a hull hit from APFSDS tanks and technically can sustain autocannon attack from the front for a second
*Stable enough to snipe off water

'''Cons:'''

*Ineffective firepower at its BR when stock, initially armed only with HEAT-FS and unreliable HESH
*The armour will only protect from frontal threats, and only until they realize that hitting the turret is the way to go
*Literally no protection from overpressure, might only sustain HEAT-FS by random chance
*The gun does not have an autoloader like Rooikats, so rushing forward in this tank is a very questionable move despite its spaced interiour
*No thermal scope in the gunner seat, user really has to multitask between the drone and tank, use cruise control, etc
*Only reaches its top speed on a road and is rather slow otherwise
*No neutral steering, so it will be very awkward to fix minor positional mistakes while on a hill
