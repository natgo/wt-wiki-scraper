== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->
The hull armour is weak and cannot be relied upon at this battle rating, while the turret can bounce some poorly shot shells due to its sharp angles towards its side. Getting to a hull down position and utilizing the tank's ability to retreat when a shot is fired or received is necessary to prevent getting shot and damaged. The turret houses 3 of the 4 crew members, meaning that a good shot (unless protected by the gun breach) will knock out all 3 crew members and send this vehicle back to the hangar.

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

'''Notes''':

* Shells are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.
* Racks 1 and 2 deplete from left to right.
* Rack 4 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 9 shells and gets filled first when loading up the tank.
* This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 1 - 2 - 3.
* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-3 into rack 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

There are multiple ways to play this tank. The most common way is utilising your good acceleration and speed to get into key sniping points on the map. Here the use of your laser rangefinder can help you snipe up to 2 km effectively. For this role, APDS is recommended due to its higher velocity than the HEATFS shell and yet still have decent penetration. Use your first shot to make the enemy tank immobile and then finish them off as it is highly unlikely they shall be able to locate you at a distance, find the proper range (unless they they happen to also have laser rangefinders which is more likely in a uptier battle) and then shoot you. To snipe, it is also advised to go hull-down and use the 10* of gun depression to reduce the amount of area exposed to enemy fire. Although not comparable to other tanks at its BR, the reverse speed of 11 km/h is still decent to get out of sticky situations.

The Vickers Mk.3 can also be used in CQC and urban fighting maps as it has good mobility and turret traverse to be able to react to an enemy in different directions. The commander's machine gun on top of the turret can be used to mark targets for friendly players as well as be able to deter incoming planes or damage them.

A mixture of APDS and HEATFS shells are good as the APDS can reliably damage an enemy tank upon penetration due to its better post-penetration damage than the HEATFS shell. The HEATFS shell can be used in scenarios such as an uptier where the APDS shell may be too lacking for penetrating much better armoured tanks and MBTs

;Notable enemies and how to engage them:

* T-55: The UFP can be penetrated by the APDS shell. It is best to shoot the right side of this tanks when head-on as it will incapacitate the driver, gunner and commander, leading to the tank's destruction. Although the left side where the ammo and fuel is stored is still a viable option, it is inconsistent and may not cause the tank to get destroyed.
* M48/M60: The UFP can bounce the APDS shell when at shot at irregular angles, it is recommended to use the HEATFS shell or attempt to hit its ammo by shooting the LFP with APDS
* Leopard A1A1: Similar to all NATO tanks, the left side of the weak front hull can be shot and knock out 3 crew members, resulting in a death or aim for the lower hull side on the left to hit the ammo storage area.

;How to counter the Vickers Mk.3

* Aim for the left side of the hull in a head on to defeat the driver, gunner and commander.
* Aim for the lower left side to detonate the frontal ammo storage.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good mobility, including good reverse speed
* Equipped with a laser rangefinder
* Gun depression angle of -10°
* Gunsight with 10x zoom
* Access to a HEATFS shell
* Stock APDS shell retains good penetration at an angle

'''Cons:'''

* Even with the turret upgrade, the armour of the Vickers Mk.3 is poor
* 10x zoom can be impractical while aiming at close targets
* The large ammo rack in the front is still present
* Small-calibre machine guns don't offer much penetration and the [[L21A1 (12.7 mm)|rangefinding 12.7 mm MG]] fires only tracer bullets that have low penetration power
