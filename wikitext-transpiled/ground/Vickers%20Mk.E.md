== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour on the Vickers Mk.E will only stop rifle-calibre munitions reliably, although some machine guns like the British 7.92 mm BESA or the German 7.92 mm MG34/42 can easily punch through certain 10 mm plates. The unsloped armour plates, combined with their weak protection levels boils down to one conclusion: avoid getting shot at. However, unlike the T-26, the Vickers comes with 4 crewmen, which means that shells with no explosive filler shells may not knock out the entire crew with one hit to the hull, giving you a small chance to fight back, but don't count on this too much.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Vickers Mk.E has a cruise speed that allows it to keep up with most vehicles at its BR. You will not be doing anything close to racing speeds, but the tank will get you where you need to go in due time.

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|ksp m/36 (8 mm)}}
The small calibre of the ksp m/36 machine gun makes it only suited to damage open-topped vehicles or low-flying aircraft. The belt is large enough to fire continuously at the enemy for at least 20 seconds.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The APHE round has a good penetration for the low BR and inflicts potent post-penetration damage

'''Cons:'''

* Poor protection
* Side armour can be penetrated even by light machine guns
