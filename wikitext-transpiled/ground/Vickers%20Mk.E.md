== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour on the Vickers Mk.E will only stop rifle-calibre munitions reliably, although some machine guns like the British 7.92 mm BESA or the German 7.92 mm MG34/42 can easily punch through certain 10 mm plates. The unsloped armour plates, combined with their weak protection levels boils down to one conclusion: avoid getting shot at. However, unlike the [[T-26]], the Vickers comes with 4 crewmen, which means that shells with no explosive filler shells may not knock out the entire crew with one hit to the hull, giving you a small chance to fight back, but don't count on this too much.

'''Armour type:'''

* Rolled homogeneous armour

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The Vickers Mk.E has a cruise speed that allows it to keep up with most vehicles at its BR. You will not be doing anything close to racing speeds, but the tank will get you where you need to go in due time.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

{{main|Psv.K/36 (37 mm)}}
The Vickers Mk.E  is equipped with the 37 mm Psv.K/36 which is a fairly mediocre weapon performance wise.

==== Ammunition ====
There are two available rounds:

* an APHE round - Max 55 mm of penetration - Lower penetration but high damage potential.
* an AP shell - Max 62 mm of penetration - Higher penetration but low damage potential.

It's best to take a mix of both types of ammunition, the APHE has the potential to knock out some enemy tanks, but will be completely ineffective against the more heavily-armoured vehicles you'll likely meet when uptiered, for these tanks it's best to use AP and try to aim for crew members if possible.

=== Machine guns ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}
<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|ksp m/36 (8 mm)}}
The small calibre of the ksp m/36 machine gun makes it only suited to damage open-topped vehicles or low-flying aircraft. The belt is large enough to fire continuously at the enemy for at least 20 seconds.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
It is recommended to play the Vickers Mk.E in a support role, flanking the battlefield and finding a good position to support your teammates from. The 37 mm cannon has quite good characteristics with its rounds (APHE, AP) being able to deal a fair amount of damage to enemy vehicles from short and long ranges. The fast reload allows for quick adjustment of aim between shots, meaning the Vickers Mk.E can be a highly effective flanking vehicle if a good camping spot is found. The gun depression of 10 degrees allow it to hide its hull to be less visible to the enemy. Keeping back at long-range is certainly an effective way to avoid taking damage.

The lack of armour is something to be kept in mind, because heavy-calibre machine guns like the 12.7 mm M2HB and 13.2 mm Breda Model 31 will be able to go through your thickest plates of armour. Because of this, it is recommended to try your best to avoid enemy vehicles getting the first shot. Driving under cover is advisable to avoid being spotted.

It is also worth keeping in mind that the Vickers Mk.E only has a reverse speed of -4 km/h. This is important to remember when driving into potential enemy fire. It is recommended to be aware of enemy positions and cover, as a retreat will be a lot slower than an advance.

Be aware that enemy aircraft with bombs or powerful guns can easily take out the Vickers Mk.E. It is advised to stick to the treeline to avoid being spotted and attacked. The Vickers Mk.E has little anti-aircraft capabilities so it is also advised to let the friendly SPAAs deal with aircraft.

'''Enemies worth noting:'''

* [[Pz.II (Family)|Pz.II]] and other tanks with autocannons can shred your armour and the modules behind it.  Generally, it is advised not to engage head on but if you are forced to, then make sure you get off the first shot before they start spraying. 
* [[:Category:Anti-aircraft vehicles|SPAAs]] - Nearly every anti-aircraft vehicle at the tier will be able to penetrate and destroy the Vickers Mk.E with ease. Not to mention that SPAAs guns have high rates of fire. As with any other vehicles, it is advised to shoot first. Certain SPAAs which are commonly underestimated like the French [[P.7.T AA]], and [[CCKW 353 AA]] and the American [[M15 CGMC]], and should be especially noted, as despite not having 20 mm autocannons like their Axis counterparts, they all have weapons capable of efficiently knocking out a Vickers Mk.E.
* The [[D2]] and some other french tanks have over 40 mm of armour which is is thick enough to stop you from penetrating them when at range or when they angle. It's advised to avoid engaging them from the front or at ranges above 500 m and instead moving closer to them to maximise the chances of penetration.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* The APHE round has a adequate penetration for the low BR and inflicts potent post-penetration damage
* Very short reload time
* Fairly accurate gun at short to medium ranges
* Adequate gun depression

'''Cons:'''

* Poor protection, side armour can be penetrated even by light machine guns
* Struggles against better-armoured foes like the D2
* Slow reverse speed
