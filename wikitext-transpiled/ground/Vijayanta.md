== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (विजयंता; lit. Victorious) was the first MBT built in India as the licensed variant of the British [[Vickers Mk.1]]. As the export tank designed by the Vickers-Armstrong, Vickers Mk.1 were designed to be a lighter yet as powerful medium tank as the Centurion series in British service; the design of this tank was acquired by India in 1961 and development soon started in UK. The development was completed by 1964 with a prototype delivered to India and joined the Indian Army a year later under the name Vijayanta. The tank was saw in action during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 and Indo-Pakistan War of 1999; although planned for decommission by 2008, the introduction of Russian-built/licensed MBTs and complications on the domestic Arjun MBT however didn't fully phrase-out all Vijayanta with were still spotted as late as 2019, serving as batteries for border troops.

Introduced in [[Update "La Royale"]] as a premium British medium tank and the first Indian ground vehicle to be introduced in game. The Vijayanta is essentially a Vickers Mk.1 with M456 105 mm HEAT-FS, other than the additional ammunition option, both tanks can be utilize with same tactics as a supporting tank while players have to pay extra caution to avoid frontline battles at all cost since the protection is rather poor for its tier.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
A short answer to the protection of Vijayanta: it is totally identical to Vickers Mk.1. As Vickers Mk.1 was designed to be the alternative to the fleet of Centurion tanks in British and overseas services, the main design feature was retaining the same firepower as the post-Mk.10 Centurions while having better mobility thanks to its lighter weight; but lighter weight also means lesser protection. The later variants of Centurion has around 240 mm RHA on UFP - for Vijayanta, it's less than half of Centurions (barely over 100 mm RHA); at its tier where APFSDS and HEATFS are very commonplace, it can be said that chances of non-penetration or ricochet is very minimal. 

For the internal layout, like Vickers Mk.1, the crews are rather cramped and three of them are on the same axis by the right side (from Vijayanta's PoV), the problem is further worsen due to the ammunition layout of the tank (up to 25 shells up front, next to the driver); any penetrated shots at the center-mass or from the right side will very like knock down the tank right away, if not detonate right away (at full load). So staying behind the lines to maximize its survivability while helping the team to take out enemy targets.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
Thanks to the lighter chassis, it can be said that Vijayanta traded its protection for far better mobility than the Centurion series. It can go as "fast" as 48 km/h while still retains similar reverse at 11.1 km/h; while it is nowhere comparable to Warsaw-Pact and most other NATO tanks (any but M48 and M60 series), it does give Vijayanta more flexibility than Centurion.

* Only -7° of gun depression compared to the more common -10°
* The coaxial 12.7 mm machine gun is meant for rangefinding and has only 7 mm of penetration
* The roof machine gun is only 7.62 mm
* Ammo rack in the front right next to the driver
* Slow gun elevation speed affects gun handling
