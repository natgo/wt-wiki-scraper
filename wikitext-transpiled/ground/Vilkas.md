== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is an armoured fighting vehicle used by Lithuania, which was developed in collaboration with ARTEC GmbH. The vehicle's roots trace back to the German-Dutch "Boxer AFV" program, showcasing a joint effort by European nations to enhance their armoured capabilities. The Vilkas variant, specifically tailored for Lithuania, integrates advanced technologies and offers versatility in combat scenarios. Entering service in the Lithuanian Armed Forces in 2019, the Vilkas deployment represents Lithuania's strategic investment in a contemporary armoured platform, capable of meeting the challenges of modern warfare.

The '''Boxer ''Vilkas''''' is an event gift German light tank introduced during [[Update "Air Superiority"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/8644-event-winter-extreme-earn-yourself-rewards-this-festive-season-en|2023 Winter Extreme event]]. The Vilkas is a unique light tank choice for German top-tier players, providing fire-and-forget Spike missiles for use against tanks at longer ranges or against nearby helicopters. As such, the Vilkas presents a new playstyle to players of the German ground tree, allowing them to rush to a good position using mobility, and play as a "sniper" with decent firepower and long-range missile, or perhaps play the vehicle more aggressively and use the Spike missiles for dispatching helicopters and long-range targets of opportunity when needed. All in all, the Vilkas is a uniquely interesting vehicle to bolster the top lineups of the German tech tree.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
As an armoured fighting vehicle, the Vilkas can only shrug off heavy machine gun fire from the front, and light machine guns from the sides. 

'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->
<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)
* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Vilkas is best played at medium range in a hull-down scenario, to use the Spike missiles and the cannon. In Realistic Battles, it is best to remain at a range (ideally further than 500 m) to use the Spike missiles efficiently, as they need at least 300 m distance to not overshoot the target. However, the 25 mm APFSDS is largely ineffective at range against heavily armoured targets unless shooting sides at a flatter angle. At closer ranges, it is easier to damage cannon barrels and tracks, but depending on the distance, the Spike missiles may be infeasible or unusable. Thus, playing at medium ranges is the best option for the Vilkas. Remaining behind cover allows the crew to be safe from all kinetic munitions, but still vulnerable to overpressure damage from explosive munitions. In addition, if the turret's ammunition is destroyed, a fire can occur. If this occurs, the Vilkas' position is easily given away by a large ammo cook-off and should be repositioned as soon as possible, ideally to a friendly capture point to re-arm. Rearming one 200-round 25 mm magazine at a capture point takes less than a minute. The excellent power-to-weight ratio of the Vilkas enables quick movements and rotations, especially in uneven environments. In addition, the commander's thermal sight permits the acquisition and firing of the Spike missiles while mostly concealed behind cover. However, due to the lacklustre payload inside the Spike missiles, multiple missiles may be required to destroy a tank. 

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Optics with thermal sensors for both the gunner and commander
* IR tracking system and ballistic computer for aerial targets
* Unmanned turret
* High power-to-weight ratio enables superior mobility
* Great maximum speed
* Blowout panels

'''Cons:'''

* Unreliable Spike missiles
* Inconsistent damage from the Bushmaster cannon
* Tall profile
* Only three belts of ammunition with easily targetable turret storage
* Large steering circle
* Mediocre reverse speed for a wheeled armoured vehicle
