The '''{{Specs|name}}''' [Long Cannon Testbed] (Chinese: WZ1001(E) 125毫米多功能火炮试验车; lit. 125 mm Multipurpose Gun Test Vehicle) was one of the prototype of what later became the ZTZ99A. Visually, it distinguishes itself from the production version with a longer gun, a smooth finish for the FY-5 ERA instead of matte, and a different hull. Before ZTZ99 was introduced to PLAGF, there were already plans for a new "3rd generation tank" where the ZTZ99 (WZ123 at the time) would be the gap-filler before the new tanks could be introduced; as soon as ZTZ99 was certified in early 2000s, Institute 70 already started the WZ1001 program with various designs led by the new chief designer Mao Ming (毛明); the tank in-game represents the 2nd prototype of WZ1001 with a longer L/54 125 mm smoothbore cannon and a hull based on ZTZ99-III. Due to economics and better reliability for the gun system, the LCT was ditched and the other prototype with L/48 cannon was then certified as what known as ZTZ99A.

Introduced in [[Update "Apex Predators"]] and sitting at the end of PLAGF line of Chinese tech tree, players will soon get used to the overall identical performance to its (technological) successor ZTZ99A with better gun handling thanks to its experimental gun layer and the high muzzle velocity; but do remember the hybrid of ZTZ99's hull with a ZTZ99A-like turret means their flaws would inherit to WZ1001 and players would have to be cautious on when to utilize its great mobility to assault enemies- planning ahead is essential for the survivability of the tank. 

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
When players take a first look at the WZ1001(E), they will soon be having deja vu from previous tanks: although the turret is mostly identical to the previous ZTZ99A other than the layout of side fences, the hull also looks very similar from [[ZTZ99-III]] (WZ123B; in fact this hull was modified from WZ123B but with an extended and elevated engine deck). This platform also marks the transition from low-profile, Warsaw-Pact/Chinese design to a more NATO approach and ensures the overall protection to be mostly identical to the ZTZ99(A). Players will still have to pay caution to their LFP, driver's port, and mantlet in case of a head-on fight. In some cases when an opponent first encounters a WZ1001(E) and mistakes it for the ZTZ99A, chances are they will land the shot on the left side of the UFP instead of the driver's seat on the centerline and failed to penetrate.

One notable armour difference between the WZ1001(E) compared to its production version is a lower coverage of FY-1D1 rooftop ERA. It is still present above the hatches of the gunner and commander but does not cover the gun breech or turret roof. This allows top-attack ATGMs like the TOW-2B or BILL to do more damage.

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
Since the WZ1001(E) was the prototype of the ZTZ99A, players might find both tanks handle very similarly other than the longer hull; this is indeed true as this was also the prototype that set the 1,500 hp 12V150HB-1 turbocharged diesel engine and CH1000 transmission for future use. Be sure to make good use of the excellent top speed for taking vantage points while having the ability to reverse back to cover with ease.

{{main|L/54 (125 mm)}}

In view for enemy tanks with even higher protection than what was foreseen by the WZ123 design, especially from Russia, the design team built a 125 mm smoothbore cannon that was compatible to previous shells and any future shells used by PLAGF, but having a longer barrel at L/54 distinguished by an additional section of heat sleeve (at 6,750 mm, the longest smoothbore gun in-game, beating out the Rheinmetall Rh 120 L/55). All previous shells from ZTZ99(A) now enjoy a higher muzzle velocity and thus higher penetration for the APFSDS (~11 mm increase for both 125-I and DTC10-125). Players will soon get used to the gun handling thanks to the identical traverse speed, though extra care will have to be taken to hide the gun from enemies when taking cover, as the longer barrel also means enemies can now hit that very additional section of the barrel, leading to the disabling of the gun.

==== Ammunition ====
'''DTP-125 HEATFS''' - The good old stock 125 mm HEATFS for PLAGF but with a penetration at only 480 mm. While the shell is in most cases ineffective against tanks with composite armour and even ERA blocks, the spalling is also unsufficient like with most HEATFS rounfs. But 2.19 kg of explosives upon lightly-armoured vehicles is lethal to them by overpressure, still a fine placeholder before having 125-I darts researched.

'''DTB-125; HE-FS''' - Another long-time friend to the Chinese 125 mm gun, the shell has a large explosive content. If enemies happen to take cover and have vulnerable parts exposed (CITV cameras, gun sights, cupola, etc.), the DTB-125 will make sure the target will be knocked out right away by overpressure, tanks that are known for their excellent protection i.e. [[Strv 122]] and [[T-80BVM]] will still fall victim to it. Because of the high explosive content, it is extremely lethal to light vehicles in sight. Just in case players opted for flanking tactics, it is better to bring some HEATFS for the sides and hit enemies from the ammunition instead.

'''125-I; APFSDS''' - The tier I APFSDS and one of the most long-lasting shells for the 125 mm gun, players would still find this shell for research even when it was first appeared on ZTZ96s; although having a slightly higher penetration at 476 mm point blank, it will not always penetrate top-tier MBTs up-front (other than Leopard 2A5/A6 and [[Ariete (Family)|Ariete]]), but players can always opt for lower plates or mantle. But it can still considerably make the grinding easier.

'''DTC10-125; APFSDS''' - The tier III APFSDS for the WZ1001 with a high penetration at 588 mm point-blank; while it is nowhere the best APFSDS at its tier, the relatively heavy projectile mass and the fastest muzzle velocity in-game (at whopping 1,810 m/s) will certainly makes long-engagement enjoyable. This will be the go-to shell for WZ1001.

'''GP125; ATGM (Tandem)''' - Another tier III modification for the WZ1001, it performs identically to its Soviet counterpart, the 9M119M1 Refleks. The missile can take down most MBTs at top tier with hits to the hull thanks to its high penetration tandem warhead and good post-penetration damage, although the APFSDS tends to be more convenient in general. Using it as a makeshift method to take out hovering helicopters is also viable as well as this will not trigger their LWS (given they are within 5 km)

'''DTB12-125; HE-VT''' - The tier IV shell for the WZ1001; it is also the only HE-VT shell in-game for MBTs (others are time-fused). Like ZTZ99A, this also turns WZ1001 into the longest anti-aircraft gun in game. Although marked as VT shell, it works both against ground targets or aerial targets where its explosive content is more than enough to inflict overpressure damage to armoured targets or disintegrate aerial targets that are within the gun's elevation range. Because it only contains slightly less explosive filler than DTB-125, it is generally recommended to take this as the only HE shell to simplify logistics.

{{main|QJG02 (14.5 mm)|QJT (5.8 mm)}}

Instead of the conventional 12.7x108 mm QJC88 from previous tanks, WZ1001(E) planned for a larger calibre 14.5x114 mm QJG02 with a lighter weight than Type 56 (KPV). Good news is that this can also cause major havoc against light vehicles or aircraft within its range, but this also trades the overall capacity with only 200 rounds onboard at 50 rounds per belt.

A major difference of WZ1001 to its technological predecessors/successor is the gun barrel itself. In most cases, the PLAGF adopted for a L/48 gun, but due to the need for greater penetration against potential foes, the WZ1001 has a longer barrel than most MBTs in game, while retaining the very familiar 125 mm calibre.

The WZ1001 prototype adopted some design features certified for the ZTZ99A, namely the turret design and elevated engine deck. While the new design enhanced its mobility vastly thanks to the new transmission, this also means that the WZ1001 is afflicted by the "NATO hump", where the gun will be blocked by the powerplant at rear angles. This might not be a major problem against other NATO tanks with high profiles, but the limited depression may not be enough to be able to deal lethal damage to Warsaw Pact tanks; in most cases, be sure to rotate the hull towards enemies' positions for protection and chance to retaliate. Thanks to its sufficiently tough turret, shots hitting the turret will likely do no harm to the tank (other than in the mantlet); however, be sure to never show the sides or angling to enemies due to the WZ1001's lack of side protection.

Players will soon find themselves at home if they are familiar with the ZTZ99A thanks to the identical mobility and very similar gun handling. While the tank itself looks very similar to the ZTZ99A, the longer barrel and different driver placement give the WZ1001 away. In most cases, due to the long-lasting flaws of the mantlet and LFP, the WZ1001 can be dealt with just like any other Warsaw Pact MBTs. Those on the receiving end should be extra cautious of the positioning of the tank. At longer ranges, the protection is enough to stop most shells. Thus, it is recommended to concentrate on long range enemy targets if possible; along with the greater survivability, it has the fastest muzzle velocity among any smoothbore gun-equipped MBT in-game, which further enhances its capability in sniping long-range targets. The railgun-like muzzle velocity of the top DTC10-125 dart will easily bypass the Iron Fist APS of the [[Black Night|Challenger 2 Black Night]] even at considerable distances. Be sure to utilize the mobility of the WZ1001 to gain vantage points thanks to its powerplant, and make sure every shot counts against enemies due to the inferior reload rate.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Shares very similar, if not identical excellent mobility of ZTZ99A
* Uses a 14.5 mm HMG which is devastating to light vehicles or aircraft
* Long barrel L/54 smoothbore cannon with extremely high muzzle velocity for darts
* Sturdy frontal protection against both kinetic and chemical shells
* Shares identical gun handling from predecessor

'''Cons:'''

* "NATO hump" that hinders gun depression at rear angles
* Shares similar weak spots from predecessors (i.e. LFP and gun mantlet)
* The hull and turret are longer than ZTZ99A, making its profile even larger
* Same insufficient vertical traverse for the main cannon
* The penetration of DTC10-125 is still below average for top tier, despite improvements
* More vulnerable to top-attack ATGMs than ZTZ99A

As part of the "3rd Generation MBT" program of the PLAGF after the introduction of the "placeholder" WZ123/ZTZ99, the new MBT started its prototype production and trials. Designed by a new engineer, Mao Ming (毛明), the tank was built with 3 different prototypes: a "123AY" with higher engine deck for the latest 12V 150HB-1 engine and CH1000 transmission developed by Zhou Guangming (周广明), and two other prototypes, now dubbed WZ1001, one with a turret similar to the mass-produced ZTZ99A, and the other with a 125 mm L/54 for higher velocity and penetration.

Due to the limited increase of performance on the new L/54 gun and short barrel-life, the L/48 variant with later revised hull design passed the certification as the WZ1001, then the later ZTZ99A - the latest MBT in PLAGF service.
