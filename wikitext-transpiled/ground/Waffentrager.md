== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 "New E.R.A."]]. Waffenträger translates to "weapon carrier" in English.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Despite its fully-traversable turret, the Waffenträger is a classic tank destroyer. It has a potent gun, which can defeat almost any heavy tank at this tier, even at long ranges. The shells have great penetration, great explosive filler, and above-average velocity for the tier. The vehicle even has a better-than-average reload speed.  (Note: keep in mind that the Waffenträger is not equipped with any machine guns.)

However, this vehicle also has poor mobility. It's just slow (both forwards and reverse), especially when stock and acceleration are poor. The tank struggles on slopes and is completely unsuited for close-up brawling. Another downside to this vehicle is its poor armour setup. Although the armour protection can defend against machine-gun fire, any cannon shell will penetrate with ease. High explosive shells may also overpressure the vehicle. And finally, the open-top turret compartment is vulnerable to aircraft and artillery fire. Therefore, it may be necessary to work with SPAA teammates and find cover under trees or behind buildings.

In addition to the poor mobility, the Waffenträger suffers a lack of gun depression when the cannon is pivoted above the radio operator's or driver's hatch, so careful hull placement is required when engaging targets below your slope level. The Waffenträger also suffers a reduced reload rate due to its cramped turret, making the act of reloading the breech with the large shells difficult and awkward.

Given the vehicle's advantages and disadvantages, a good way to play this vehicle is often in a sniping play-style. Staying hidden, keeping distance, and only exposing the vehicle to shoot capitalizes on the strength of the vehicle's gun while minimizing the effects of its weak armour. Additionally, it is effortless to hide this vehicle behind cover in a hull-down position since it has a low profile and good gun depression.

Alternatively, it may also be beneficial to employ a more ambush-based playstyle with this vehicle. But since this requires more close-up engagements, be careful to avoid lengthy brawls, where the Waffenträger's poor armour and mobility will hinder it greatly. Positioning is still critical. Finally, it may be sometimes possible to engage the enemy while orienting the vehicle sideways or backwards. This protects the engine and transmission from enemy fire and prevents the protruding frontal optics ports from interfering with gun traverse and depression.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 88 mm PaK 43 gun power can destroy any vehicle it meets
* Full rotating turret with the powerful gun
* Decent -8° gun depression for hull-down positions
* Low profile construction makes the vehicle easily conceal
* Suspension and tracks cover a good portion of the lower side hull for protection
* All AP and APHE shells over-pierce the tank without dealing much damage due to the fragile armour

'''Cons:'''

* Open-top turret crew vulnerable to shrapnel, machine guns, airstrikes, artillery, and such
* Gun recoil can jump the vehicle dramatically, throwing off the aim and bouncing the vehicle position
* Thin overall armour of between 10-20 mm
* 5 mm roof armour means an aerial attack is deadly
* 5 mm belly armour makes any HE shots able to penetrate through the bottom
* Front-mounted engine and transmission means both can be knocked out with a front shot, immobilizing the vehicle
* Poor acceleration
* Hatches on the front of the tank can disrupt the aim

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
===Development===
In as early as 1942, the German Wehrmacht was looking for a way to make large anti-tank guns easier to deploy and transport and fire the gun and fight on the front lines. Four major German companies (Krupp, Rheinmetall, Borsig, and Ardelt) took part in a tender of the Waffenamt (German Army Weapons Agency) in 1943 for the project. Then, in April 1944, the four companies presented their prototypes. With Krupp and Steyr working together on a design, and Rheinmetall and Borsig on their own. Both designs envisaged placing the 8.8 cm PaK 43 L / 71 in a lightly armoured, upwardly open, rotatable tower mounted on a hull of a Raupenschlepper Ost (a tracked artillery mover) to keep costs down and reduce complexity. However, the decision was made for the prototype of the last company, Ardelt, therefore making the Krupp-Steyr design unwanted by the Waffenamt.

===Combat usage===
Due to the design losing the tender, the tank never saw mass production or combat service. Only one wooden model and one prototype were manufactured on September 2, 1944.
