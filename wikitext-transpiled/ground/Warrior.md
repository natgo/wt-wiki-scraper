== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (or just the '''{{specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 "The Valkyries"]].

Warrior is basically a big box with a round turret, which has a little gun in middle, "ears" (ATGM cameras), and the ATGM launcher itself on the right side. Front of the hull is sloped to decrease small firearms damage. IFV hull is huge compared to even medium tanks of some factions (about double the size of [[T-62]]) and looks even bigger when carrying additional armour.

If the vehicle has add-on armour, it's easily identified for its riveted plates on sides of the vehicle. Usually, after being shot with a high velocity round, they break off. Plates do not protect the rear of the vehicle.

The Warrior is mostly played as an aggressive ATGM tank or ambush scout tank, though it can fulfil any role that doesn't involve it being constantly shot at.

It's best described as a combination of [[Crusader AA Mk I]] and [[M113A1 (TOW)|M113A1]], with benefits of both and downsides of neither. Armour is relatively poor, but can be upgraded via a modification to partially protect from hazards that normally annihilate light tanks. The weapon combo is potent enough to destroy even modern MBTs, and with add-on armour, the Warrior can bully even heavy tanks in close range, though the turret is still very vulnerable.

The Warrior can be played defensively (mostly around hills and mountains), or aggressively (on flat terrains and in towns), given that there is enough cover for the Warrior. In realistic battles, Warrior can also hide relatively well and use either of its weapons to punish unsuspecting people, or just scout them.

This vehicle is very easy to play while still in stock mode, as it has most essentials available at stock or unlocked early on, however, every upgrade only makes it even stronger.

[[File:Weakspot warrior.jpg|thumb|304x304px|While this construction outside of {{PAGENAME}} can sometimes stop HESH coming from behind, it will also often doom the tank by allowing chemical shells coming from the side to damage unprotected parts of the hull, triggering overpressure damage.]]
'''Overview:'''

The {{PAGENAME}} has a huge profile, and its armour is mostly made of aluminium alloys, which compromises its protection against medium tanks. While at the first glance the hull may seem uniform, and technically thick enough to survive hits of kinetic shells up to 120 mm and chemical shells of up to 105 mm, it has a lot of weak points, which trigger overpressure damage. For that reason, if artillery hit its hull or turret directly, the {{PAGENAME}} will not survive. Direct hit of explosive shells to the middle of the tank on any side, ATGM optics (commander sight) or turret hit in general is likely to instantly destroy the tank.

When considering smaller weapons, the {{PAGENAME}} is well protected against heavy machine guns. The frontal ventilation is a glaring weak spot, but internal RHA screens will prevent any HMG fire from hitting the crew. However, its turret, side engine ventilation, hull's back and even sides themselves have weak spots, which can be penetrated by 12.7 mm and 14.5 mm heavy machine guns. At some angles, the gunner optics (left "ear") can also be penetrated by 14.5 mm to take out the gunner.

The hull frontal armour is sloped and can sustain light automatic cannon fire at best, allowing it to fight [[BMP-2]] or SPAA armed with 23 mm guns head-on in some scenarios, as long as they do not know where to fire. It is preferable to fight them from great distance or while employing high ground to increase their attack angle as close to 60 degrees as possible, rendering their main weapons useless. The engine and screens to the right of the driver add a sort of spaced armour effect by absorbing penetrating shells. This works well in addition to the add on armour, as it means that half the front is protected by the engine and the other half by composite armour.

'''Add-on Armour:'''

The add-on panels defend the sides of the hull, with a piece of composite on the frontal plate covering the driver. These panels are geared towards protection against Chemical munitions and add surprisingly little armour against kinetic rounds.

The side armour plates conceal weak spots on the {{PAGENAME}} hull and are effective against chemical rounds. In general, they prevent HMG bullets from getting into tank and stop overpressure damage from being hit by HESH and HEAT (including ATGM), efficiency against HE varies depending on the hit spot, but it generally helps against weak rockets. Angling can be an effective tactic with these panels installed, and it will also help the tank to survive some 30 mm kinetic rounds, as long as the screen is not destroyed (which usually doesn't take long). After being hit once by a big shell, these panels generally break off the tank and no longer protect it.

The composite in front of the driver is much stronger and is capable of stopping weak HEAT rounds with about 400 mm of penetration, and will also add enough kinetic protection to stop most direct 20 mm autocannon round hits. It will not save the tank from direct 120 mm HE hit, as the explosion will reach tank's turret and likely annihilate vehicle via pressure damage.

[[File:WarriorArmour ProtectionAnalysis HESH.jpg|x170px|thumb|right|Protection analysis view: frontal panel gives a 45% chance for the Warrior to not take any damage from frontal HESH shot by just being there. Side armour does the same thing for the entirety of the sides but is significantly weaker.]]

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=852|rbMinHp=486|AoAweight=1}}

Mobility is adequate on vehicle's BR, it can move forward and backwards equally fast, but don't expect it to be climbing mountains like with the powerful [[Vickers MBT]] in Arcade Battles. It will just slide down if the surface is too steep.

In Arcade Battles, it's generally driving at 46-54 km/h offroad in either direction without engine upgrades, regardless of additional armour. With mobility upgrades it may drive up to 60 km/h, but not very often. Speed of 81-83 km/h can be reached if the {{PAGENAME}} drove off the hill and keep driving forward, or on completely flat terrains, like roads in the American desert, though sometimes it just doesn't work again at the same spot.

Due to its sheer size, it almost never gives in to ramming attempts, though it cannot move enemy heavy tanks either and shouldn't fight them on a narrow street.

Accidentally hitting something on max speed, especially explosive decorations, launches the Warrior up to 5 m in the air, which is very entertaining, but almost never fazes the enemy.

* Adding armour does not decrease {{PAGENAME}}'s hp/ton significantly, and it only reduces maximum climb angle by 2 degrees, so it should be used when unlocked without worries of mobility penalty.
* Despite having enough horsepower, this vehicle can not climb mountains.

{{main|L21A1 (30 mm)}}

The 30 mm L21A1 RARDEN cannon is an effective autocannon, although its rate of fire is sub-par. The 30 mm APDS belt is capable of penetrating the front armour of most light vehicles, and the sides of almost any tank that the warrior will face. The sub-par rate of fire and low post-penetration effects mean that gunners will need to pick out individual crew members or modules in each well-placed shot. While not technically stabilized, warrior gunners can manage to fire with some accuracy on the move if they are skilled. The shell velocity in the RARDEN APDS belt and laser rangefinder allows the warrior to lay down effective fire on light enemy targets up to about 2 km (at any range in AB), although it will be difficult to hit moving targets past about 1.5 km.

There is virtually no reason to use the stock belts on the warrior. The stock belt uses half HE and half AP rounds, but only the HE rounds have tracers. The lack of tracers causes awkward gunnery, and the penetration on the AP shell is not satisfactory. Meanwhile, the APDS belt has tracers with every round and is very effective against enemy vehicles.

Performance of this belt deteriorates much slower than of AP-I belt, but it does less damage the more armour it had to penetrate, resulting in an inability to set off enemy ammo racks in 1 hit if it was behind any good armour. If used against planes, it can damage or rip off wings, or snipe out the pilot.

{{main|MILAN|MILAN 2}}

The Warrior carries MILAN missiles as a secondary weapon, although these function more as the primary armament due to the tank based gameplay in Warthunder.
 [[File:Warrior sneak attack on tank.JPG|220px|thumb|right|Warrior managed to launch MILAN 2 straight at the enemy tank, instantly destroying it.]]
The MILAN 1 has 500 mm of RHA penetration. It is 103 mm in diameter.

The MILAN launcher can be upgraded to the MILAN 2, which has 730 mm of RHA penetration. The MILAN 2 is 115 mm in diameter. The flight performance is essentially the same, but it's starting speed is higher.

The missile is launched via commander's optics (the ones on top of the turret), if commander optics get destroyed, the Warrior cannot launch ATGM anymore. They can only be repaired via "manual repair".

The missile can be guided either by the gunner scope (located inside cannon itself in AB/RB) or commander scope (by activating "commander fire control" via a hotkey) unlike with the Striker. Use of the commander scope is preferable, as it exposes much less of the tank and confuses some people which expect you to drive out completely, but this is only possible if the commander is still alive.

If chosen scope cannot see the missile directly, the tank will lose control over it, so any indirect attacks should be aimed quickly after sending the missile as high as possible. Choosing the commander scope also allows to attack with missiles a bit like Swingfire - if binoculars are able to see the target on low ground, then it most likely can be hit by a curved missile, even if the scope cannot be directly aimed at it.

The MILAN can be used at close ranges, but cannot be fired point-blank (10 m or so), and if not careful it can overshoot (look at launcher itself in Third-person view to avoid this). The missile only has 2 km of range so it is not particularly useful against enemies at very long range, or more often against helicopters who are hovering far away from the battlefield.

For targets far away, it is recommended to use the laser rangefinder before launching the missile, in order not to waste a missile on a target beyond the 2 km range.

=== Machine guns ===

<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->
{{main|L94A1 (7.62 mm)}}

The machine gun is kind of useless for Warrior, but it can still destroy weak fences, which normally slows any tank down if they hit them, and it makes much less noise than the main gun. During direct fight against other ATGM tanks with no cover present it can be used to try and shoot down enemy missiles.

For enemy marking purposes in RB, Scouting should be used instead, as it doesn't reveal the vehicle.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Generally, Warrior needs to quickly get into the medium range of the expected enemy, then figure out its strategy for the current battle. While moving towards an objective, Warrior should keep a low profile and scout every enemy it can notice.

After looking around, Warrior either takes some hills or well-protected hull-down position near to capture point to utilize ATGMs, laser rangefinder and scouting ability for medium-range attacks and team support, or takes an aggressive approach and goes for stealthy flanks and close-range combat. It's not rare to see Warrior try and destroy heavy tanks, which just don't expect the light tank to go at them.

If forced, Warrior can always use a smokescreen to disrupt enemy plans of taking it down, either baiting them to waste time looking for it, or using smokescreen, MILAN-2, scouting and add-on armour together to attack the enemy from the fog with little fear of being punished for it. For some reason enemy does not often reply to ATGM shots but instantly fires back at cannon fire, so use cannon sparingly during this.

[[File:Warrior shadow strike.jpg|thumb|Example of using smokes and armour offensively in arcade battle. Not only enemy is blinded and can't hold the line, allowing the team to rush in, but even if they fire towards the Warrior's general direction, they will likely load HESH or HEAT and fire at the hull, hitting the add-on armour and doing no or less than fatal damage. MILAN-2, on the other hand, is almost unblockable and can obliterate many tanks in one hit, and the player can clearly see the position of enemy tanks due to scouting. A skilled Warrior can take out up to two tanks per one smoke deploy like that. Works on any range from 30 m to 800 m.]]
In any mode, but especially in AB, mark the enemy with the "scout" ability, so they can be found whenever smoke is deployed. This must be done for two main reasons:

# Since the MILAN ATGM can instantly destroy or cripple anything, even seeing just the name of enemy and type of tank through smoke is good enough for the Warrior to have a chance for a hit. In realistic battles, it's less reliable, but the Warrior can still see where the enemy is. For light tanks, the 30 mm autocannon can work just fine (just don't do that against BMP; unless it already spotted and scouted the Warrior, it's not worth it).
# In Arcade Battles, If the "intelligence" reward is obtained for marking enemy that was or is invisible to teammates and then got destroyed, the player will get artillery support point and airstrike point. If the squadmates destroys the marked target, the player will get airstrike point regardless as a squad assist.

Due to this, even in 9.0 arcade battle, the Warrior can call in ATGM helicopters on very first minute of a fight, simply by marking 2 enemy vehicles and destroying someone with an almost undodgeable and unblockable missile, while the enemy cannot even request gunships to protect themselves from it. ATGM helicopter than can destroy 6 to 10 enemy tanks, significantly weakening the enemy team. As the game goes on, Warrior can join multiple air battles in a row as second attack helicopter or bomber, because it's a scout vehicle.

Since MILAN has relatively good controls and there is 8 missiles total, the Warrior can try and fire it above hills and guide it down on people, much like Swingfire and Striker. It's harder to aim at the enemy without a straight visual firing line, but if it hits anywhere important, they could be knocked out anyway. Since the Warrior is considered a scout vehicle, mark them and ping them on the map, even if a shot lands a hit.

In Arcade Battles (AB), it's best to fire the missile at tank's gunner, so in case if it didn't destroy the tank on its own, the Warrior can just circle around the enemy and use the main gun to destroy the engine, then proceed to incapacitate the crew. In Realistic battles (RB) even taking out cannon barrel or breech might be enough, as repairs in that mode take much more time, and field repair doesn't even guarantee, that gun won't just jam itself again or fire in a completely different direction.

As with all light tanks playstyle, be very wary of people that have any kind of explosive ammo, as the Warrior has relatively low amount of armour on it and can be easily destroyed by overpressure damage. With Add-on armour, the Warrior can fight and take some hits, but the vehicle's turret, front and back are still a giant weak spot.

Usually, MBTs will carry AP ammo as their first shot, which may just over-penetrate and maybe do almost nothing. So if there is an absolute must directly attack someone, attack them, SPGs or other non-Soviet light tanks.

There is also a trick related to the Warrior - if baiting an enemy that is looking towards the Warrior, pull the Warrior's rear end out of cover first. Since the rear has very little critical components outside of the MILAN missile stowage, usually being shot there doesn't do anything too drastic for the overall tank health. After being fired at, drive out of cover and fire back at them. You also can pull out the front-right side of the hull instead, if you can afford sacrificing the driver and just want to bait the enemy shot for teammates. This trick probably won't work twice, indicating you should make the most out of the opportunity you have at hand. Nobody likes to be shot with ATGMs and the second shot coming will most certainly be HE of some kind. This tactic may backfire if your IFV gets shot with APHE, or APFSDS will enter the vehicle at a bad angle, but those types of ammunition have the potential of instantly destroying the Warrior regardless of the entry point.

Finally, the Warrior can also repair any allies, so if in cover and not busy - do help them.

====Specific enemies worth noting====
<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this tank and how to fight them in an encounter. (i.e. Tiger II - shoot the turret cheeks)-->
Any Soviet light tanks: Destroy it with ATGM, use scout ability to see when they are trying to leave their cover, use laser rangefinder to never miss, generally never play around with them. BMP-1 might accidentally hit tank's weak spot and destroy it's entire crew, BMP-2 will just turn on full auto mode on main gun and unload half of its magazine into its target, even if it misses its ATGM, just to get rid of a threat and even add-on armour won't save the Warrior at that point. Oddly enough, the infamous Object 906 is probably the least dangerous of them, but it will still destroy the Warrior with proper shot placements. If the Warrior is spaded in modifications, just call artillery strike on them.

IS-7: Do not ever engage this thing frontally without MILAN 2 and add-on armour. It is also extremely risky to attack it on a narrow street. Fire at the right (their left) side, to disable its turret. The main goal in engaging this tank is to disable its engine with the 30 mm gun and then blow it up by destroying its ammo in back of a turret or just blowing it up by firing ATGM in the middle of it or into ammo rack, if there is a spare ATGM (the IS-7, as a threat to any BR below 8.0, should be prioritized with every missile in the Warrior's capacity). Even the many machine guns on the IS-7 can shred the Warrior apart.

Any tank with heavy machine guns: If possessing the add-on armour modification, simply avoid turning the rear towards them, otherwise the weak rear armour would be easily penetrated. Weaker machine guns of around 7.62 mm calibre can't penetrate the Warrior armour at all, and even 14,5 mm will have extreme problems penetrating the front of the hull and protected sides, so just destroy them by returning cannon fire and avoiding being hit in the turret. They'll never see it coming.

====Counter-tactics====
<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. Just flank)-->
Just fire at its turret, preferably with explosives or autocannons with a high rate of fire.

If it acts spooky by being ominous and peeking over hills, you are already in danger. Disable its ATGM camera (on "ears") with concentrated fire if a direct hit to the crew and modules is not possible. If hit by explosives, it might cause overpressure damage and destroy the tank outright. Keep in mind that your attacks must damage the entire IFV really hard for ATGM repairs to take long (otherwise it may take less than a few seconds, which is not good).

If the missile is already homing towards a vehicle with no way to avoid it, in RB/SB try to get outside of direct missile control range by not letting the light tank to aim at you directly (which will make missile spiral crazily and possibly missing by a centimetre) or face it with the gun barrel and fire all machine guns in hopes that it would get shot mid-air or get absorbed by the gun and not damage or destroy any critical modules.

Never fire pure AP rounds to the back of this tank, since unless it hits one of the missile ammo racks there, it will just do nothing to it.

If the Warrior has the add-on armour package, do not underestimate it and use anything possible when engaging it, not just HMG. Warrior repairs and reloads fast enough to disable its adversaries, if it must, "just set it on fire" mindset is not going to stop it. Machine guns are nearly useless against hull from front, despite it having incomplete add-on armour protection, use them to disable ATGM controls or missiles themselves.

In case Warrior destroyed your primary weapon, but doesn't have a composite screen and you still have 12.7 mm machine gun, you can fire at its side ventilation to destroy it. It is on the right side of the IFV (left for you, if facing it). The add-on armour greatly complicates this, as it will block any direct shots at it, leaving you with only its rear as an option.

The Warrior can be destroyed by a fighter jet. However, do not just strafe it directly, as it actually can fire back and may have enough armour to block stray shots. It's best to attack it from the top.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Equipped with 8 extremely powerful MILAN ATGMs
* Can stop pushes if manages to get to good cover (scouting, laser rangefinder, artillery, ATGMs, good mobility and smoke)
* Can survive poorly aimed shots and even brawl with MBTs if armour mod is installed
* Has gunner thermal (2nd generation) vision and commander/driver night vision
* Exceptionally mobile both forward and backwards. True fresh airs for British tankers!
* Favourable levels of gun depression vertically and horizontally
* Turret rotation speed ideal for brawling, especially when dealing with several targets in rapid succession.

'''Cons:'''

* Can be destroyed easily, especially if situation awareness is not maintained; a big visible target when unable to use commander scope
* Any properly landed turret shot will destroy the vehicle, little chance to survive if it was a HE shell
* Add-on armour heavily depends on enemy being inaccurate and each side panel will only save the tank once
* Engine exhaust placement (front right corner of tank) obscure gunners thermal vision when looking between approximately 45° and 80° to the right.
* No stabilization for the turret greatly affects firing capacities. Disheartening performance on duels

The FV510 infantry fighting vehicle was developed as part of a program to create a modern IFV for the British army at the end of the '70s. The vehicle went into series production in 1986. The vehicle was equipped with 30 mm gun, fed by magazines of three shells each. This gun was designed to destroy lightly armoured vehicles with maximum accuracy. For the Desert Storm operation, the Warriors were equipped with Chobham passive armour – add-on armour plates that significantly improved the IFV's defence in battle, allowing it to survive a hit from an RPG-7 grenade and shrapnel from high-calibre HE rounds. A little later, in 1990, the military decided to equip the Warrior with anti-tank weaponry – a 30 mm gun for these targets was clearly not enough. The roof of the turret was equipped with a launcher for the MILAN ATGM. The commander used a hatch to fire the ATGM, and it was reloaded through the upper hatch of the armoured vehicle's infantry compartment. The FV510 Warrior is still in service with the British army and is the main IFV of the United Kingdom.

Similar tanks:

* [[M113 (Family)|M113]] - Most of the ATGM tanks based on this chassis look and work similarly to the Warrior, but they do not double as a light tank
* [[PUMA]] - Extremely similar tank with maximum emphasis put on defences
