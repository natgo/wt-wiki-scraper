== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The XM-803's frontal armour is only effective versus full-calibre AP and APHE rounds and certain APDS rounds. Almost all large calibre (76 mm and up) have no trouble slicing through it, even when hitting the frontal armour at an angle. Large calibre HEAT-FS too has no problem going through, although the large fuel tank behind the frontal hull armour can sometimes absorb most damage. The fuel tank is also completely separate from the rest of the tank, and as a result often burns out without damaging the rest of the vehicle. Because the armour has a layer of air in it, it is very effective against HESH rounds. All the spalling generated by the HESH round when it hits the first plate will get absorbed by the plate behind it. One big weak spot on the turret it the left (when facing it) turret cheek. This is because this part of the turret is not protected by spaced armour and only consists of 177.8 mm thick CHA plate, which most chemical and kinetic energy projectiles can penetrate with ease.

'''Armour type:'''

* Spaced armour (Hull front, Turret front)
* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,937|rbMinHp=1,106}}

The mobility of the {{PAGENAME}} is worse than that of the MBT-70. In its stock configuration, it has a horsepower/ton ratio of 21.39, while with all upgrades this increases to 24.08 HP/t. The top speed (both forward and reverse) is 64 km/h (40 mph) with 8 gears for both directions. The tank can reach its top speed quickly on flat roads, while on more difficult terrain the top speed drops by around 20 km/h. The tank has neutral steering and good turning ability on all terrains.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The XM-803, like the MBT-70, is a very good flanker. To get the most out of this tank you must use its high speed and acceleration to flank the enemy or set up ambushes. Its gun and ammunition are good enough to penetrate most lower BR tanks with ease, although when up-tiered you will have to resort to aiming for the weak spots of opponents. The HEAT round you get is free, and will easily penetrate tanks with plain steel armour, but it's lacking when facing tanks with composite armour, and it has a rather mediocre muzzle velocity, making aiming and leading at longer ranges more difficult. The APFSDS round has decent penetration and will penetrate most opponents with relative ease. It also has very high muzzle velocity, almost 1.5 km/s, making aiming even at longer ranges easy. The ATGM is very useful and free, it's very good at long ranges, and is very effective against stationary or slow-moving helicopters.

When faced with an enemy around a corner, one can attempt to bait shots by only exposing the frontal hull - opponents will often shoot this, only to find, much to their dismay, that there is nothing of value inside and you may not even have to use your fire extinguisher to put it out due to the fact that it is separate from the rest of the tank.

While the armour may seem impressive at first, it won't protect you against most guns at and around its battle rating. Most tanks at this rank have access to powerful APFSDS and HEAT-FS rounds, which have no trouble penetrating you. Knowing this, you mustn't rely on your armour to protect you.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Effective ammunition choice (Stock ATGM, stock HEAT shell, powerful APFSDS)
* Can fire ATGMs without restriction, even when moving at full speed
* Good mobility and acceleration, high speed both forwards and backwards
* Top mounted .50 cal can allow you to damage low-flying aircraft
* Frontal Fuel tank behind the spaced armour which can sometimes absorb enemy chemical energy rounds
* Steady reload time thanks to the autoloader: losing a crew member will not impact the reload speed, and it still functions when putting out a fire
* Has smoke grenade launchers
* Turret mantlet is strong, can resist even certain APFSDS rounds
* Has hydropneumatic suspension
* Excellent dual zoom of 8x and 12x

'''Cons:'''

* The spaced armour is not composite armour and cannot provide adequate protection against most guns of its rank
* Frontal armour can be penetrated even by some APHE rounds
* Weak sides and LFP
* Hydropneumatic suspension only works for up and down
* Ammo racks are large, can be easily hit, and do not have blowout panels
* Vulnerable to the rear due to raised engine deck
* Cramped interior, loss of more than one crew member more likely when penetrated
* Poor roof armour protection on the ammo and engine section
* Chemical projectiles (HEAT and ATGM) will struggle a lot at this battle rating as vehicles with ERA protection are common, especially on Soviet vehicles.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Once it became apparent that the MBT-70 project was doomed to fail in the early '70s due to high costs and reliability issues, the U.S. Congress decided to cut their losses on the project by cancelling the MBT-70, and instead, diverted funding to the development of a new project called XM803.

The XM803 was, in essence, envisioned to be a "budget version" of the MBT-70. Although the new vehicle would heavily be based on the MBT-70, inheriting many of its design solutions, it would also try to drastically reduce production costs by using more conventional and only American-made parts. Although this meant that the XM803 had to give up some of its high-tech equipment in favour of lower production costs, it was projected that the influence of these changes on the XM803's combat performance would be minimal.

Despite showing favourable performance and being seen as a promising design by the Army, the XM803 still remained a comparably expensive tank to produce even with the applied changes over the MBT-70. Moreover, neither the MBT-70 nor the XM803 seemed to offer any substantial increase in combat performance over the already in service M60 Patton to justify the high production cost. This ultimately led to the Congress cancelling work on the XM803 only a short while after the cancellation of the MBT-70. In the late 1970s, some funding of the two failed projects would, later on, find its way to support the development of an entirely new, but this time around, more conventional tank project. That tank, of course, being the legendary M1 Abrams itself.
