== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]]. The XM-1 (Chrysler) is an Xbox exclusive vehicle, only available from the [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/war-thunder-xm-1-chrysler/bxntjdjgsk54?activetab=pivot:overviewtab Microsoft store].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour on this vehicle is not very good. Most APFSDS at this rank will have no issue penetrating the armoured zones with ease. Despite there being spaced armor in the front of the tank, the driver is also located here behind and surrounded by three exterior fuel tanks, and can be fairly vulnerable to even APDS shells at lower tiered tanks, such as the M60 or T54E2. In a down-tier, you will be able to soak up some damage when being hit by weaker rounds, but not much.

'''Armour type:'''

* Spaced armour (Hull front)
* Composite armour (Turret front)
* Rolled homogeneous armour
* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This vehicle is best used as a support tank to flank and knock out other tanks from their flanks and not as a "brawler". Instead of charging full speed into the enemy head on. This tank is best suited to attacking from the flank. Flanking is where this tank succeeds, using its speed and manoeuvrability to get to the rear or sides of the enemy. Another good tactic is to shoot-and-scoot to maximize the manoeuvrability and gun over an opponent.

This tank can also be used to devastating effect in urban combat. In urban combat, it is advised that you never go alone, stay with or behind friendly tanks, and do not rush forward. If you play an ambush and defensive style of combat, at least at the beginning of the match, it is likely you will be able to get multiple kills/assists and should be able to stop the enemy push. If your team is winning, and the enemy is outnumbered, it may be possible to push forward quickly but cautiously, in order to flank and catch enemies off guard, hopefully securing victory for your team.

The survivability of the XM-1 (Chrysler): The XM-1 has relatively weak armour, but it is oddly survivable. It is somewhat rare to get killed by a single shot when playing the XM-1. Usually, it takes two or more shots to take it out, thanks to the spacey interior, and the blowout ammo racks in the turret. However a single HEATFS hit will render you knocked out of the fight.
Sometimes it takes up to 10 badly aimed or unlucky shots to take out the XM-1, this is especially true for long-range shots. To further increase the survivability odds, use the terrain to cover you, after firing a shot reverse back and pop out again like a jack in a box. The excellent mobility of this fine tank allows for this to achieved, and used well it can turn the tide of a impending  defeat to a victory.

Some enemies to be concerned about:

[[T-64B]]: Aim for the drivers hatch if you facing it frontally. If possible, get around its side and hit it dead under the turret, you will blow up its ammo racks this way.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very good speed, manoeuvrability and acceleration
* Very fast turret traverse
* Excellent manoeuvrability/speed
* Not one, not two, but three secondary machine guns
* Blow out ammo rack prevents an ammo shot from destroying the tank immediately

'''Cons:'''

* Average gun against enemies
* While it has composite armour, it is useless against most weapons it will face
* Gun is sub-par; same APFSDS round (360 mm of penetration point-blank) as on the Type 74 and M60A1 RISE (P)
* Front plate is made up of spaced armour, which doesn't provide the protection comparable to composite
* Similar ammo storage to the M1 Abrams, has the same side weak spot (although it is rarely exploited, due to the sub-par armour everywhere else)
* Tracks are very noisy (louder than the engine!)

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

It started in the early 1970s, at the height of the Cold War and the arms race. After the joint German-American project to create the MBT-70 main battle tank was closed, and the new all-American XM803 project was deemed an insufficient and too expensive response to the newest Soviet developments, the US Department of Defense developed a new list of requirements for the future American main battle tank. Two engineering giants joined the contest: the Chrysler and General Motors companies. Both contestants decided to use the developments for the MBT-70 and XM803 to design a new tank. Many corrections and additions were made to the tactical and technical requirements of the American government, first and foremost, on the defensive characteristics of the future main battle tank. The requirements for the tank's armour and survivability increased, along with its maintainability in the field. In addition, the Arab-Israeli conflict showed that a modern tank must have the ability to effectively destroy armoured targets at long distances, including with kinetic shells, and also have a sufficiently large complement of shells. In spite of the changes and additions to the technical specification, the contestants managed to achieve their goals, and by 1976, they presented their developments, the experimental prototypes of the XM-1 tank, for testing. Both vehicles were outwardly very similar, with practically identical dimensions. They were alike in their layouts and used the same 105 mm M68 rifled cannon. Both tanks turned out very well. Which prototype did the military choose, and why?

The XM-1 (GM), the contest model from General Motors, became a further development of ideas and technological solutions for the MBT-70 and XM803 projects, including the diesel powertrain and mixed undercarriage with six roller wheels per side, three with hydraulic suspension and three with torsion bar suspension. The competitor to General Motors, the Chrysler company, used their XM-1 (C) model to present not only a progressive gas-turbine engine but also a new undercarriage with seven independent roller wheels on each side with individual torsion bar suspension. In addition, the Chrysler engineers were able to save funds on constructing the tank by optimizing the components of the aiming equipment and the gun stabilization system. These details played a decisive role in the selection of the contractor to make the XM-1 project a reality. In spite of the fact that numerous flaws and "teething problems" arose during the project, the prototype for the USA's next-generation main battle tank was confirmed. After several cycles of correcting issues and modernizing the prototype XM-1 (C), the first vehicles began to be deployed under the designation M1 Abrams.
