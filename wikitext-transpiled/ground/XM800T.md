== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->	
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Seek & Destroy"]]. It was in essence the predecessor to the M2 Bradley.

<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In realistic battles, the XM800T is a quick but not so agile scout flanker. It is great to move quickly along a flank, mark enemies, and send well placed side shots to light vehicles. The reverse acceleration isn't great stock; so choose your cover carefully until the vehicle is completely modified. Try to avoid any head on brawls, you will lose even against something like a BMP. As anti-air the higher fire rate is helpful, but you will have better luck sticking to helicopters as targets instead of any jets at this BR.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Respectable top speed
* High fire rate
* 3 Crew members
* Has access to a stabilizer

'''Cons:'''

* Tall
* Slow stock reverse acceleration

In the summer of 1974, as part of the ARSV (Armored Reconnaissance Scout Vehicle) program to create a new command and reconnaissance vehicle to replace the M114, FMC Corporation presented a prototype of a new generation of scout vehicle on a tracked chassis for testing. Despite satisfactory performance, the tracked version did not meet the required weight limits and was not accepted for production. In total, FMC built 3 XM800T experimental prototypes, one of which was designed as a tank destroyer and equipped with a TOW anti-tank guided missile launcher.
