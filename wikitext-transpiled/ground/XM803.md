The '''Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked, 152 mm Gun/Launcher XM-803''', developed from the [[MBT-70]], was part of the abandoned collaborative U.S. and West German initiative to develop a new main battle tank to replace the existing [[M60 (Family)|M60 family of MBT]] during the 1960s. The program experienced significant challenges from the start, with the United States Army and the German Bundeswehr having diverging doctrines that were not coordinated and were not resolved before the project was too far along to be modified. By the late 1960s, West Germany abandoned the project and the U.S. solely funded the project for the next few years. The MBT-70 was redesigned and designated the XM-803, as an attempt to modify the MBT-70 design into a low-cost substitution using entirely U.S.-made components, resulting in the strikingly similar XM-803 prototype. The biggest cost savings came from switching to less expensive steel armour plates. Costs were also decreased by using an engine built in the U.S. instead of West Germany. The prototype was a little heavier and a little slower compared to the original MBT-70. Despite these savings, the XM-803 design began to match the MBT-70 in sophistication as development progressed and was ultimately terminated. The XM-803 program was cancelled by Congress in December 1971, and work on a new tank program began, the XM-1, which ultimately resulted in the production-model [[M1 Abrams]] MBT.

Introduced in [[Update 1.79 "Project X"]], the XM-803 offers players unique insights into the pathway of U.S. tank development that ultimately leads to the current-day M1 Abrams MBT. Despite the program's eventual demise, the XM-803 gives several unique capabilities for Cold War U.S. Army ground forces players, particularly the capacity to launch anti-tank guided missiles from the gun barrel, which is unusual in Western MBTs but prevalent in Soviet MBTs. The XM-803 performs very similarly to its ancestor, the MBT-70; however, it suffers from a slightly lower top speed and lacks the original 20 mm cannon mounted on the turret roof. Overall, the MBT strikes a good balance between protection, speed, and firepower, allowing players to easily engage most threats.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The XM-803's frontal armour is only effective versus full-calibre AP and APHE rounds and certain APDS rounds. Almost all large calibre (76 mm and up) sabot rounds will have no trouble slicing through it, even when hitting the frontal armour at an angle. Large calibre HEAT-FS has no problem going through it too, although the large fuel tank behind the frontal hull armour can sometimes absorb a lot of the damage. The fuel tank is also completely separate from the rest of the tank, and as a result, often burns out without damaging the rest of the vehicle. The spaced armour proves effective against HESH rounds as the spall generated upon detonation on the external armour will be soaked by the underlying layers, significantly reducing the damaging effect of the round. One big weak spot on the turret is the left turret cheek (the right from the view of the tank commander). This is because this part of the turret is not protected by spaced armour and only consists of a 177.8 mm thick CHA plate, which most chemical and kinetic energy projectiles can penetrate with ease.

'''Armour type:'''

* Spaced armour (Hull front, Turret front)

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,937|rbMinHp=1,106}}

The mobility of the {{PAGENAME}} is worse than that of the MBT-70. In its stock configuration, it has a horsepower/ton ratio of 21.39, while with all upgrades this increases to 24.08 HP/t. The top speed (both forward and reverse) is 64 km/h (40 mph) with 8 gears for both directions. The tank can reach its top speed quickly on flat roads, while on more difficult terrain the top speed drops by around 20 km/h. The tank has neutral steering and good turning ability on all terrains.

XM803 represents a change in direction when compared to previous US tanks. Previous tanks in the tech tree like the [[M4]]<nowiki/>s and [[M60]]<nowiki/>s serve much more as jack-of-all-trade vehicles. Their mobility, guns and armour are all average and do not have especially potent features that user can exploit. This, however, is completely flipped on its head with the transition to the XM803. The survivability, on paper, is extremely poor. It will not survive many hits, if any, from ATGMs or cannon fire thanks to only a three-man crew layout. However, this can be completely disregarded by focusing on the mobility instead. The XM803 has almost twice the horsepower of [[M60]]<nowiki/>s, and weighs significantly less. This makes the tank extremely fast and agile, sometimes even faster than light tanks at the same BR.

Thanks to the extremely good mobility, it can be incredibly difficult for opponents to keep track of it in close range brawls. Thanks to this, the first priority of the user would be to catch single or small groups of enemies off-guard, destroy them, and run away. In the opening stages of a match, it may be tempting to drive in guns-blazing to try and snatch a couple of free kills, however the distribution of enemies across the map and the sheer number of them will mean that they will simply hunt the user down. To avoid a premature and frankly embarrassing demise, move into the centre of the map and wait behind solid cover. Use visual and audio-cues to take note of the number of enemies. If there are lots of enemies, use the solid cover to remain hidden and allow them to prepare for an engagement with your teammates first and pick them off. Avoid getting shot during this time, as the longer into the match the XM803 lasts, the better it will perform. After this, the latter parts of the game are simply a point-and-click adventure.

The APFSDS round has decent penetration and will defeat most foes easily. It also has very high muzzle velocity, almost 1,500 m/s, making aiming at longer ranges easy. The ATGM which comes stock can be very useful, especially when first unlocking the vehicle. Though it has an increased reload time of 12 seconds, it can extend your engagement distance significantly if you lack the necessary means otherwise.

When faced with an enemy around a corner, one can attempt to bait shots by only exposing the frontal hull - opponents will often shoot this, only to find, much to their dismay, that there is nothing of value inside and you may not even have to use your fire extinguisher to put it out due to the fact that it is separate from the rest of the tank. If this is not desirable, one can simply 'pop smoke' and simply reverse out of the way using the exceptional reverse gears.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Good selection of ammunition types (Stock ATGM, stock HEAT shell, APFSDS)
* The ATGMs can be fired at any time, even when not stationary.
* Good mobility and acceleration, high speed both forwards and backwards
* Top mounted .50 cal can allow you to damage low-flying aircraft
* Frontal Fuel tank behind the spaced armour which can sometimes absorb enemy chemical effect rounds
* Steady reload time thanks to the autoloader: losing a crew member will not impact the reload speed, and it still functions when putting out a fire
* Has smoke grenade launchers
* Turret mantlet is strong, can even resist certain APFSDS rounds
* Features a hydropneumatic suspension which can have its clearance raised or lowered
* Excellent dual zoom of 8x and 12x

'''Cons:'''

* The spaced armour is not composite armour and cannot provide adequate protection against most guns of its rank
* Frontal armour can be penetrated even by some APHE rounds
* Weak sides and LFP
* Only the clearance can be adjusted with the hydropneumatic suspension
* Ammo racks are large, can be easily hit, and do not have blowout panels
* Vulnerable to the rear due to raised engine deck
* Cramped interior, loss of more than one crew member more likely when penetrated
* Poor roof armour protection on the ammo and engine section
* Chemical projectiles (HEAT and ATGM) will struggle a lot at this battle rating as vehicles with ERA protection are common, especially on Soviet vehicles.
* Reload rate of 7.5s is terrible.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

Once it became apparent that the MBT-70 project was doomed to fail in the early '70s due to high costs and reliability issues, the U.S. Congress decided to cut their losses on the project by cancelling the MBT-70, and instead, diverted funding to the development of a new project called XM803.

The XM803 was, in essence, envisioned to be a "budget version" of the MBT-70. Although the new vehicle would heavily be based on the MBT-70, inheriting many of its design solutions, it would also try to drastically reduce production costs by using more conventional and only American-made parts. Although this meant that the XM803 had to give up some of its high-tech equipment in favour of lower production costs, it was projected that the influence of these changes on the XM803's combat performance would be minimal.

Despite showing favourable performance and being seen as a promising design by the Army, the XM803 still remained a comparably expensive tank to produce even with the applied changes over the MBT-70. Moreover, neither the MBT-70 nor the XM803 seemed to offer any substantial increase in combat performance over the already in service M60 Patton to justify the high production cost. This ultimately led to the Congress cancelling work on the XM803 only a short while after the cancellation of the MBT-70. In the late 1970s, some funding of the two failed projects would, later on, find its way to support the development of an entirely new, but this time around, more conventional tank project. That tank, of course, being the legendary M1 Abrams itself.
