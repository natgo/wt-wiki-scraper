== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 "Assault"]].

This unarmoured truck is equipped with a good fast-firing 76.2 mm cannon, which has similar armour penetration to the infamous [[D-5T (85 mm)|D-5T]] from later soviet vehicles. This is the last unarmoured truck chassis of the Soviet tech tree, after the [[ZiS-12 (94-KM)]] and before the [[ZiS-43]]. The 29-K is a pure sniper, use it as such. This truck is all about its precise, fast firing gun and nothing else. Safely cover up 2/3 of the vehicle behind a building, leaving only the gun, gunner and one loader exposed, taking precise shots at unsuspecting enemies.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The {{PAGENAME}} has 6 crew members, meaning it can take a few shots and even resist MG fire (if well-covered). Ammo racks are covered with 12 mm steel plates, meaning regular MGs cannot ignite them. Otherwise, any HE shell will rip the YaG-10 apart and artillery usually shreds the vehicle with shrapnel. This low armour value has its advantages: APHE shells will often not detonate or simply not hit anything if shot from the sides.

'''Armour type:'''

* Structural steel (Truck cabin)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (Bed frame)
* Wood (Truck bed)

<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 133|rbMinHp= 83}}

It's a cannon on wheels. Unlike most other Soviet trucks, it is not a GAZ chassis, it is a ten-wheeled YaG-10. This new (and unique) chassis is slower than its predecessors, but has better ground flotation with 10 wheels in total (8 in the back and under the gun, 2 at the front). The wheeled configuration makes turning on the spot impossible; thus, anticipate an escape route in case the situation turns sour.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|3-K (76 mm)}}

The 76.2 mm 3-K equipped on this chassis is one hell of a gun, with good penetration, relatively flat ballistic trajectory and enough explosives in the APHE shell to knock out any target it penetrates. 3 loaders provide it with a fast reload speed, comparable to Rank 1 vehicles. These 3 crew members allows a bit of loss before feeling a reduced firing rate. The only thing the gun lacks is turning speed for reacting faster, especially since the cabin gets in the way of the gun when trying to shoot forwards. This gun has similar characteristics to the D-5T, found on later Soviet tanks, providing a good learning curve to tanks using it (mainly [[SU-85]], [[IS-1]], [[T-34-85 (D-5T)]]).

The gun can also fire HE-DF shells, however setting the fuse requires rangefinding the target which is never done quickly enough against air targets. Even if the shell manages to detonate near the plane, its explosive amount is rarely enough to take down the target in one go. Low rate of fire compared to proper SPAA doesn't help either. In general, planes should be the lowest priority target of this vehicle.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This truck is preferably used at a distance to increase its survivability. Most MGs have poor accuracy at distance, greatly decreasing their ability to shred the 29-K. It has a good and very precise gun capable of taking down (almost) any target it may encounter from the front. Always show the sides since it decreases the chances of having a bullet pass right through all of the crew members in one shot. Showing the side also allows the YaG-10 to use the full 360° traverse to its best. If possible, only show the gun, this way, it allows minimal exposure and can allow for quick hiding at a moment's notice and if shot, only sacrifices one or two crew members.

'''Do not:'''

* Rush into towns
* Drive directly towards an enemy
* Stay near an artillery strike
* Snipe in the middle of a field: find cover

Although this is a Rank 3 vehicle, its low BR often places it against Rank 2 tanks. Even with its awesome cannon, this truck can encounter fierce foes with even better armour.

* [[Churchill Mk VII]], [[M4A3E2|M4A3E2&nbsp;Jumbo]]: Both impervious to shots on the front glacis.
* [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)|Jagdpanzer&nbsp;38(t)&nbsp;Hetzer]]: Well-angled armour can bounce many shots.
* [[Calliope]]: Has many ready-to-fire rockets to annihilate the 29-K.
* Any SPAAG is a threat as their heavy automatic weapons will rip through the thin armour.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Decent AP penetration
* Good reload time
* Precise gun, good ballistic trajectory
* Paper-thin armour reduces spalling from AP shells and APHE fuse rarely activates
* Six crew members
* Ammo racks are protected from low calibre MG fire

'''Cons:'''

* Paper-thin armour lets machine guns rip it to shreds
* Poor gun depression of -3°
* Ammo rack in rear and middle of the overall vehicle
* Slow gun traverse
* Very low mobility in harsher terrain
* Can be easily destroyed by air strikes
* No access to higher penetration rounds
* Lack of a gun shield means that the gunners are easier to take out than they are on the 88 mm Flak truck
* Shredded by artillery and HE shells
* Prone to destruction by overpressure
* Cannot shoot upfront due to the high truck cabin

== History ==
