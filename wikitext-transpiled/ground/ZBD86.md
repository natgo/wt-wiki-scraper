== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (ZBD86式步兵战车; industry code: WZ501) is the Chinese reverse-engineered version of the Soviet [[BMP-1]] which was acquired from military equipment exchanges with Egypt in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, during military modernization, the PLAGF faced a pressing need for a new IFV for its mechanized troops. As a result, one of the stored BMP-1s from Egypt was transported to Mainland China for evaluation. In order to expedite the development of a new IFV, the Central Military Commission approved plans to reverse-engineer the BMP-1, despite its underperforming gun systems. The WZ501 was subsequently built in December 1980, incorporating some domestic subsystems. However, due to testing and manufacturing flaws, engineers took nearly 8 years to finalize the design, making additional changes that happened to align with the improvements made to the later BMP-1 variants. The ZBD86 successfully passed state certification in 1986 and began production in April 1987, initially with placeholder gun systems. After failed attempts to introduce American and British turrets, the ZBD86 eventually received new 25/30 mm autocannon turrets in the late 1990s, becoming the ZBD86-I and ZBD86A respectively. These versions are still in service and recently competed with their ideological counterpart, the BMP-2, in the Army Games jointly held by Russia and Mainland China, where the ZBD86A demonstrated superior performance.

Introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]], the ZBD86 can be considered a Chinese variant of the BMP-1, being nearly identical to the original Soviet version when stock, with the exception of the absence of rolled-up canvas on the turret sides. However, this vehicle possesses a hidden advantage: the "ZBD86 Late" modification. This equips it with the HJ-73E ATGM, a highly potent derivative of the original "Malyutka" SACLOS control and a tandem warhead. When employed effectively, the HJ-73E can neutralize any target the ZBD86 encounters, irrespective of ERA or composite armour protection. This makes the ZBD86 a valuable asset in uptiers and a versatile vehicle overall.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->

The ZBD86 has very little to speak of in the armour department. Minimal frontal and nearly non-existent side armour results in the vehicle being vulnerable to almost any incoming fire. At most it can be counted on to shrug off heavy machine gun fire from the front. As such, the vehicle's survivability stems entirely from its mobility and reasonably small profile. Where possible, utilise hills or other cover, only exposing as much of the vehicle as is necessary to engage an unaware target.

The thin armour renders the ZBD86 vulnerable to overpressure damage from chemical munitions, nearby artillery impacts, and aircraft ordnance. Be very cautious of aircraft and do not stick around under artillery fire.

Despite the lack of armour, however, the ZBD86 will, on occasion, survive hits unexpectedly - the internals of the vehicle are largely non-critical and many rounds will over-penetrate, particularly subcalibre rounds.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=465|rbMinHp=265}}

The ZBD86's mobility is reasonably good, although somewhat lacking relative to other IFVs. Despite that, once it gets moving it can travel at a decent pace. It can reach around 45 km/h when driving off-road on flat terrain.

Be aware when attempting flanking manoeuvres and early pushes that there are vehicles with better mobility characteristics, and in many cases you'll encounter a vehicle before reaching a desirable position.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The modules and stock grind of the ZBD86 are very similar to the BMP-1. The main difference is that that the "ZBD86 Late" modification is present instead of the BMP-1P modification. "ZBD86 Late" upgrades the vehicle's ATGM and adds smoke grenades, as on the BMP-1P, but does not remove the autoloader. Thus, a spaded ZBD86 will always reload and is not dependent on crew reload skills compared to a spaded BMP-1. The smoke grenades are mounted on the turret cheeks, three per side, instead of residing behind the turret as on the BMP-1P.

=== Main armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|3}}
<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|Type 85 (73 mm)}}

The Type 85 main cannon is a somewhat finicky weapon. The penetration of the HEAT round is no higher than the [[Type 62]]'s HEATFS but the muzzle velocity of 665 m/s is lower, making it difficult to use at long range. Still, the gun reloads in only 6 seconds and has an autoloader. It can be quite lethal at close quarters with careful aim and knowledge of enemy modules, these factors being important due to the limited post-penetration damage. For targets with larger volumes, it is best to aim for ammo racks. If that is difficult or risky, disable their gun and mobility first. HEAT has a TNT equivalent of about 480 g and might cause overpressure damage to light targets on occasion. Keep in mind that the {{PAGENAME}} does not feature any sort of stabilisation at all, and due to its light weight the gun is near impossible to get on target at speed.

There is almost no reason to use the HE round. Its muzzle velocity is an abysmal 290 m/s and it has minimal penetration, making it useless against armoured targets, it can only be used against open-topped ATGM carriers similar to the [[M113A1 (TOW) (China)|M113]] or super light ATGM carriers of BR 9.0+, like the [[Wiesel 1A2]] (but these will probably know better and just dodge).

{{main|HJ-73|HJ-73E}}

'''HJ-73'''

The {{PAGENAME}} comes with a rail-mounted manually-guided ATGM as stock, initially aimed manually and with somewhat mediocre penetration and explosive mass values. While occasionally useful, generally the main gun is easier and more reliable. Use it at long range against enemies who are not paying attention or to finish off a crippled target while the main gun is reloading. It does not have enough penetration to bypass ERA.

* Guidance type: MCLOS
* Firing range: 3 km

'''HJ-73E'''

Once the ZBD-86 Late upgrade is researched, the HJ-73 ATGM is replaced with a HJ-73E. Despite the new ATGM retaining the rail-mount, it is significantly more powerful and easier to use due to its semi-automatic guiding system. It penetrates more than twice as much as the original HJ-73 and ignores ERA due to the tandem-charge warhead. This will go clean through almost any target that the ZBD86 can encounter, even those equipped with early composite armour. It has enough penetration to go through the turret cheek of the [[M1 Abrams]]! Despite having a significantly lower TNT equivalent of 1.83 kg compared to the original HJ-73, the HJ-73E has excellent post-penetration damage due to its sheer penetration power. A center mass impact should be enough to take out all but the most voluminous targets.

Keep in mind that the ATGM can only be fired when stopped or at extremely low speeds. It also travels more slowly at 130 m/s compared to the 205 m/s of the BMP-1P's 9M113 ATGM.

The {{PAGENAME}} comes equipped with a coaxial 7.62 mm Type 86 machine gun. This is only useful for clearing small obstacles or exposed crew in open-top vehicles.

Some experience with the previous [[Type 62]] will transfer to the ZBD86. Both are armed with HEAT rounds, have similar mobility, and are best used in ambushes. The ZBD86 enjoys a significantly faster reload, better turret rotation speed, and powerful ATGMs to supplement the main gun. However, the ZBD86 has poorer defensive properties since it's a larger target and has worse gun depression. It is even more important to maintain stealth and good positioning, but on the bright side it can unleash a lot of pain onto its victims upon a successful attack.

The ZBD86 is a shoot-and-scoot type of vehicle as an exposed ZBD86 is a dead ZBD86 - avoid being a target at all costs. Use your mobility to find reasonable sniping spots for the ATGM that have a good view and cover to hide behind. The cannon is helpful at close quarters, where targeting crew members and ammo racks is easy, but is difficult to aim precisely at medium or long range. At these distances, the traditional 1-2 punch of first firing the main gun and quickly following up with an ATGM is viable. Remember that if ''anything'' sees you, it can destroy you - even a .50 cal will make quick work of the ZBD86 from the sides or back. Retreat back into cover while reloading and be careful if you have damaged a target without crippling them; once an enemy knows your position, it becomes far easier for them to destroy you.

The ZBD86's HEAT shell can be formidable against light tanks and SPAAs since these vehicles tend to have smaller volumes and more tightly clustered crew. It is generally the best to aim for crew compartments so that the HEAT jet can do as much work as possible; the explosive content may or may not be able to trigger overpressure damage depending on the target and impact zone, so count it as a nice surprise if it happens. Vehicles equipped with stabilized autocannons like the [[Falcon]], [[Gepard]], or [[M3 Bradley]] can easily maul the thinly-protected ZBD86, so do not pop out in plain sight and do your best to disable them in one shot. ATGMs are typically better saved for armoured targets but it usually only takes one of them to blow a light target to smithereens.

The HJ-73E is an enticing weapon since its tandem warhead and extremely high penetration will maul any vehicle it meets. ERA-equiped tanks like the [[Magach 3 (USA)|Magach 3]], [[Sho't Kal Dalet (Great Britain)|Sho't Kal Dalet]], and [[Centurion Mk.5 AVRE]], which the original BMP-1 might struggle with, can be given a very rude surprise. Tough heavy tanks with steel armour can also be dispatched easily, making the ZBD86 a giant-slayer of sorts. Unfortunately, the HJ-73E travels slowly and is mounted on an upward-tilted launch rail like the basic HJ-73, which make it inconvenient to use at both close quarters and long range. Keep a healthy distance of at least 200 m from your target before launching the ATGM. For long distance engagements, try to use the HJ-73E against targets that are either immobile and not paying attention or exposed in the open without much cover. It is also important to stay close to cover yourself while launching the ATGM, as attentive enemies can deduce your location and guiding the missile requires staying in the line-of-sight and thus being at least partially exposed for the entire flight duration.

A lucky opponent (and/or one with a lot of machine guns) may be able to shoot the HJ-73E out of the air due to its slow flight speed. If they attempt this, the counter is to guide the missile on a less predictable path while it makes its way to the target, only aiming directly when it gets close. A similar tactic can be helpful against enemies that are not immediately focusing on the ZBD86 but may react to a missile heading straight towards them; for example, launching and guiding the HJ-73E in a different direction while keeping them in view might fool them into thinking that you are aiming at another target, which does not arouse the same panic factor, but snapping your aim to them at the last second as a bootleg form of terminal guidance will leave them very little time to duck into cover or deploy smoke grenades. Remember that these kinds of fancy missile manoeuvres take longer, leaving the ZBD86 more exposed, so it is still best to prioritize unaware targets and use direct aim.

Be very careful of aircraft, as the boxy ZBD86 is easy to spot from above. With only 6-7 mm of roof armour, it's trivial for contemporary planes to riddle it with holes. When planes are around, take advantage of the smoke grenades and ESS to mask your position when necessary. If there are buildings and trees to hide among, even better.

The ZBD86 can research NVD, which can help during night battles to increase visibility. NVD is available in commander, gunner, driver and outside viewports. Once purchased, the NVD modification also allows the use of a infrared spotlight to help illuminate targets if they are hard to see. However, it is mounted to the hull, and as such will require the hull to be rotated to illuminate anything.

=== Pros and cons ===

{{main|BMP-1#History|l1=History of the BMP-1}}

The People's Republic of China produced many Soviet vehicles such as the [[Type 59]]/[[T-54 (1951)|T-54]] and [[J-6A|J-6]]/[[MiG-19PT|MiG-19]] under license during its early years, when relations with the Soviet Union were cordial. However, the Sino-Soviet split starting from the early 1960s significantly toned down the cooperation between the two countries. When the BMP-1 first entered service around 1968, the Soviet Union was unwilling to share this new and novel vehicle with China. The BMP-1 was exported to numerous Soviet client states however, and some of these countries like Egypt were on good terms with China. A BMP-1 example was delivered to China from Egypt in the early 1980s and the design was subsequently reverse engineered into the '''ZBD86''', also known as "Type 86", entering service with the PLA in 1986.  The original ZBD 86 model was mostly identical to the BMP-1, featuring a copy of the 9M14 Malyutka ATGM called the "[[HJ-73]]", but since almost two decades had passed since the BMP-1's original introduction, the design was in need of improvements. The "NFV-1" variant was designed for export in collaboration with the American FMC company, featuring a [[M242 (25 mm)|25 mm M242 Bushmaster cannon]] in a redesigned turret. The NFV-1 did not enter service, but Chinese designers learned from the project that for IFVs, autocannons were significantly more practical than the original 73 mm low-velocity cannon. Subsequent models were all armed with autocannons. The ZBD 86-I was the first updated variant to enter mass production and was equipped with the same M242 cannon in an unusual overhead turret, apparently lacking ATGM capability, along with a more powerful engine. The modernized "ZBD86A" variant used ZPT99 30 mm autocannon (domestic version of [[2A72 (30 mm)|2A72]], imported in parallel to the BMP-3 turret brought from Russia) in an angular and more traditional turret that could once more mount an upgraded version coded [[HJ-73E]] which enhances its odds to fight back heavier vehicles .  Over 3,000 ZBD 86s have been produced and over 1,000 are still in service today. However, they have been supplanted in recent years by more advanced Chinese IFVs such as the ZBD04 series, which boast much better protection and armament.
