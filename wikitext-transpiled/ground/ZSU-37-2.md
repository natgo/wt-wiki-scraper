== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]].

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
Sharing the same hull of the [[SU-100P]], the hull is protected enough for heavy machine gun fire but lacks protection against everything else. However, the turret is barely armoured for low calibre machine gun fire (with only 8.9mm of thickness), it has little survivability against everything it will face and will be destroyed by overpressure with most CE ammunition (HE, ATGM, rockets, bombs, etc.)

'''Armour type:'''
* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof

| Hull || 9.4 mm (72°) || 9.4 mm ''Top'' <br>9.4 mm ''Bottom'' || 9.4 mm || 9.4 mm
|-
| Turret || 8.9 mm ''Turret front'' <br> 8.9 mm ''Gun mantlet'' || 8.9 mm || 8.9 mm || 8.9 mm

'''Notes:'''

* Suspension wheels are 10 mm thick, tracks are 15 mm thick, and torsion bars are 22 mm thick.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=568|rbMinHp=354}}

Since it is mounted on the SU-100P chassis, it has good mobility with a top speed of 70 km/h on a flat road capable of getting you into good firing positons early-on in the battle. It does benefit from regenerative steering, reducing the speed loss when turning but not as much as with neutral steering. The reverse speed is good enough to enable you to disengage easily and play peek-a-boo with the enemy.

<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|2A11 (37 mm)}}

This tank has access to a double mount of Shipunov 2A11 37 mm autocannon, a very versatile weapon, considering its vertical guidance, traverse speed, and selection of ammo belts. It is similar to the one seen on the [[BMP-2]]. Due to being double mount, it has an RPM of 1,000. It is devastating against both aircraft and ground vehicles even with the standard AP round. It does not get access to APDS belts like on the 2A45 30 mm autocannon but the AP belts are more than enough to disable and destroy modules from all angles as well as destroy enemy tanks from the sides.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The ZSU-37-2 should be played entirely as an AA vehicle. Do not go tank hunting in this vehicle, as you do not have the armour. Focus on keeping the skies clear, something that this vehicle does very well. A high rate of fire and very fast turret traverse means that you should be able to target and destroy even the fastest jets.

You have a high ammo count with this vehicle, meaning that you can afford to find a good spot away from the main fight in order to pick off enemy planes. Unless you need to reload your ammo, avoid capture points. They are usually the hub of most of the fighting and going to them will put you in the firing line.

While it is fully enclosed, the ZSU-37-2 has armour which makes the M18 Hellcat look like a heavy tank. Even 7.62 mm machine guns stand a fair chance of penetrating this vehicle. This makes you a primary target for aircraft, which are usually armed with cannons or high penetration machine guns and will easily take you out.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High rate of fire: allows for area saturation
* Relatively high top speed
* High ammo count
* Fast turret traverse
* Can penetrate most vehicles from the side
* Radar-assisted fire control

'''Cons:'''

* Thin armour: aircraft cannons will cause severe damage
* Radar has very low scan speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The ZSU-37-2 was the long range counterpart of the ZSU-23-4, it entered development at the same time the ZSU-23-4 did and each one fullfilled different roles. It was developed by Uralmashzavod based on the SU-100P chassis designated Object 119. The ZSU-37-2 was meant to counter targets at 3km. A single prototype vehicle was built and was tested on December 1960, both ZSU-23-4 and ZSU-37-2 were accepted for service. It never saw service as the ZSU-23-4 was preferred as an SPAA
