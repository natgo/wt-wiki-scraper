== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''ZTS63''' (Chinese: ZTS63式水陆两栖坦克, industry code WZ211; known as Type 63 before 1987 nomenclature revision), originally certified in 1963 as the amphibious tank for PLANMC or PLAGF units with the need to cross the water bodies abundant in Asia, received some of the technologies used on ZTZ59A and ZTQ62 that had already been installed successfully since 1980; in the ZTS63's case, it received a laser rangefinder and better fire control system for long-range fire support. These tanks served during the Sino-Vietnamese War in the early 1980s as a supporter to troops against Vietnamese troops and militia with very few tanks in service; although having insufficient protection against cannons and RPGs, these vehicles were kept in service until the later ZTS63A and eventually ZLT05 or newer IFVs replaced its role as an amphibious tank, marking the end of the prefix ZTS in PLA service.

Introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], players of the [[Type 62]] or [[Type 63-I]] will soon find themselves at home thanks to its identical handling and overall design. Some welcome upgrades including better FCS and the installation of a Type 54 DShK machine gun also make it a more versatile alternative to its predecessors. With both APFSDS and a laser rangefinder with automatic ballistic solutions, not only does this greatly extend the combat distance of the tank, it also greatly increases its odds to survive as this feature is extremely rare at its tier. However, players will still have to beware of its below-average protection against even HMGs and rather slow turret traverse speed, these could be fatal if players run into heated fights without the situational awareness needed.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
One thing to note is that the name of ZTS63 is interchangeable with Type 63, other than the name change after 1980, HMG on turret and a LRF on the mantlet by the centerline, the overall design of these two tanks are totally identical. For the needs of amphibious operations, the protection is reduced to the bare minimum to stop rifle calibre bullets and shrapnel; other than the mantlet at 50 mm, the whole vehicle has only up to 20 mm of armour: autocannons and HMGs will tear down the vehicle with ease. So it's better to keep the vehicle from the heated battlefield and act as a supporter of the team to deliver possible final blow to enemy vehicles or disabling enemies as much as possible.

{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->
The ZTS63 didn't receive any upgrades in terms of powerplant and transmission, so it shares the same 12150L-2 diesel engine found previously on Type 63-I; the very slight or even no weight change on the tank also means it can retain a sufficiently high power-to-weight ratio at around 20 hp/t. If players ever have the need to flank enemies by taking detours on water, it could also travel on water at 11 km/h, one of the fastest speed among other amphibious vehicle in game.

{{main|Type 63 (85 mm)}}

Still sharing the same gun as the Type 62 and 63, the Type 63 85 mm rifled cannon still handles totally identically to the Type 63-I with some changes on the ammunition available. Players will find the same exact advantages and flaws from previous vehicles - while the calibre is larger than most light tanks of its tier with a variety of ammunition and now APFSDS among them, players need extra situational awareness to use the gun as it has much slower reaction time than most light tanks at its tier as well; plan ahead and turn the turret before any close-quarter assaults.

The previous Type 63-I has no HMG installed on top; in ZTS63's case, it has a pintle Type 54 DShK installed on the commander side of turret, giving it the chance to unleash 12.7 mm bullets against light targets or aircraft/helicopters that came too close.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

At first glance, ZTS63 looks exactly like its pre-1980 cousin Type 63-I; this is indeed true as they are the same vehicle plus new FCS and a HMG mounted on the former, players from Type 63-I will get their hands on the tank rather quickly thanks to their totally identical handling in terms of mobility and tactical flexibility to flank enemies. Do remember that ZTS63 is still a light tank with minimal protection due to its amphibious capability (for buoyancy reasons at complicated waters), while the turret might look very similar to T-54/ Type 59's, but the thickness is at most rated for HMG fire at longer distance; anything with a caliber of over 20 mm with have no problem tearing down the tank with ease, let alone the chassis with even less protection. The design of ZTS63 is relatively large to LTs at its tier, therefore it is extremely essential to conceal the vehicle from enemy sights, going frontline means a quick death sentence to the tank as well; thus, the lightweight of the vehicle could be put into use by flanking enemies by taking detours to enemies' flanks, alternatively utilize the river network on some maps to launch sudden attacks from the rear (its 11 km/h on-water speed thanks to the water jet propulsion system certainly helps a lot). Another uncommon feature of ZTS63 from most LTs of its tier is its LRF and automatic ballistic solution, the tank might have insufficient magnification for long-range engagements, but the two aforementioned equipment will certainly helps taking out enemies showing their sides from afar; its stock HEATFS shell also helps as most LTs would have to either have to rely on APCR with subpar damage or lacking a rangefinder for long-range engagements. If HEATFS is not your cup of tea, its researchable, conventional APHE and the only 85 mm APFSDS in game will certainly give players more option to take down various enemies- APHE for hitting enemies from the sides and blowing them out with its explosive fillers, while APFSDS ensures flat trajectory and penetration to take out heavy targets up-front or at long range. Although messing with aircrafts or rotorcrafts on a ZTS63 is a rather unrecommended move, if there's one flying straight at the player, they might have to reconsider as the Type 54 DShK will give ZTS63 a chance to earn a surprise kill on aircrafts; 12.7x108 mm bullets can certainly do extensive damage to enemies.

Overall, ZTS63 is a welcomed addition to PLAGF line-up thanks to its better FCS and various ammunition options; but do remember to plan your assaults ahead or turn the turret beforehand for incoming, unaware enemies, sudden strikes from unexpected places is the key to support the team to advance for victory.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

As the previous Type 63 (ZTS63 after 1987) was commissioned by 1965, there were some flaws suggested by the PLA units that received the tank, thus the need for an upgrade on ZTS63 arose. There were a few major modifications for the tank including single transmission control stick, HMG gun mantle, safety locks for hatches, revised seats, new suspension springs and etc. Among these modifications, some parts from late-production ZTQ62 including its fire control system and laser rangefinder were also introduced to the ZTS63 revision by the late 1970s. These tanks rolled off the production line by the same time and likely have join the Sino-Vietnamese War where its FCS and amphibious capabilities would shine due to the rivery terrain of Vietnam, where they were sometimes used as makeshift SPGs to strike fortifications or suppressing waves of infantry. 

Some of these tanks were then modified to ZTS63A in the late 1990s with upgraded firepower in view for the possible landing operations. Although the landing didn't happen, the ZTS63A also set the footsteps for the later ZLT05 assault gun which is also currently the fastest amphibious armoured vehicle in commission.
