== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (94-KM gun mount on a ZIS-12 truck) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 "Battle March"]].

The 94-KM is an improvement over the [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]] with its dual-mounted 25 mm cannons, increasing its rate of fire and area of saturation for anti-aircraft duties.

This SPAA is commonly referred to as the "Milk Truck" by the community.

== General info ==
=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}
<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->
The armour of the ZiS-12 (as seen in prior models) is inexistent even for shrapnel. Thus, the commander should always avoid or shoot to kill whatever enemy he sees. Not only for the fact the main gun is able to destroy the SPAA in a single shot but also because even low calibre machine gun fire is able to destroy the vehicle, specially on the vehicle turret as it is open. All aircraft will be able to get easy kills with this if the commander is unaware of aircraft existence. Being an open vehicle with milimetrical thickness armour and no gun shield invites all enemy players to use machine guns to kill it.

'''Armour type:'''

* Structural steel
* Wood (Truck bed)
* Rolled homogeneous armour (Gun mount)

'''Notes:'''

* The wheels are 2 mm thick.
* The truck bed is 15 mm of wood, which will probably not offer as much protection as the truck cab.
* The radiator housing is unarmoured.

=== Mobility ===
{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}
<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->

{{tankMobility|abMinHp=99|rbMinHp=62}}

The mobility of the ZiS-12 is not exactly the fastest but is not mediocre either. When used on roads, top speeds are really high and is able to reach speeds of 80km/h. When off-road, the ZiS-12 will struggle, not much but speed will be drastically reduced compared to roads. Mud, water, sand and snow are the worst enemies of tires, mainly for the treaction for said environments. When in maps in which sand or snow are inevitable (Sands of Sinai for example) always stay on or close to a road.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

The most important module for this anti-air vehicle is arguably the OZR-132 full-HE ammo belt, which greatly improves the cannon's anti-air abilities. Since the vehicle has practically no armour, it usually finds little success in an anti-tank role, so the BR-132 modification is not as useful, even though it gives the vehicle high-penetrating rounds. Similarly, mobility upgrades are not a top priority when it comes to modules for the ZiS-12.

=== Main armament ===
{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}
<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->
{{main|72-K (25 mm)}}

The ZiS-12 (94-KM) is armed with dual 25 mm autocannons, devastating for all armoured vehicles seen at the battle rating. The calibre and penetration is not the most fearful characteristic of this weapons, the fire rate and RPM is. Due to being dual mount, the RPM is elevated to 480. At first sight this may not be seen as a threat but depending on the ammunition used, the ZiS-12 is able to either play anti-tank or anti-air role. The RPM helps not only in scaring enemy planes but also to redirect fire upon missed shots. A single hit to an aircraft with this weapons will be fatal, even with the AP belt.

==== Ammunition ====

* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|FI-T*|Fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - These belts can fulfill both roles until the others are researched but with a lesser effectiveness.
* '''OZR-132:''' {{Annotation|FI-T*|Fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - These are suited to the AA role but useless against ground vehicles.
* '''BR-132:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}} - These are best against lightly armoured tanks at close range and still do good damage to planes.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
This anti-aircraft gun is used similarly as the GAZ-MM (72-K) and is armed with not one, but two 25 mm cannons that dish out twice the damage, traded for the gun shield of the former. Get to a good vantage point using the vehicle's speed, and then use the cannons to shoot down aircraft that threaten the team. Beware of any tanks or aircraft, as even machine guns can destroy the vehicle. If faced with light tanks, try to run away with the high speed of the vehicle, or try to destroy it using the cannons. The 25 mm's will offer enough penetration to go through most of a light tank's armour. A good strategy might be to flank the enemy team or an individual and attack it from the side. Caution should be paid to what tank you are shooting at, although the AP clip is effective against the side armour of most tanks this vehicle will be up against. Heavy tanks should be avoided, unless the ZiS-12 is serving as a distraction for the team or you are sure that you can penetrate their armour. Again, being shot by anything will often result in your vehicle being destroyed or put out of action. Although this vehicle is speedy, speed alone will not be enough to avoid enemy shots and machine-gun fire. One way to help mitigate the damage your vehicle might take in an engagement is by reversing up a hill, depressing your barrels over the ridge, only exposing two of your four crew members. Even if you do get shot, the driver and commander will usually survive, allowing you to escape.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Lightly-armoured enemies are easy to penetrate with AP rounds
* Dual-mounted cannons have a high rate of fire
* Extremely low reload time allows the guns to fire nearly continuously
* Good engine and transmission will enable it to accelerate and drive at high speeds and stop in a reasonable distance
* Air targets belt almost guarantees shooting down a plane on a direct hit

'''Cons:'''

* No armour or protection whatsoever
* Operating the 37 mm cannon creates a lot of noise, even if you are behind cover enemies will find you easily
* Ground vehicles and planes can quickly destroy the vehicle with a mere machine gun
* Highly vulnerable to overpressure (artillery, chemical shells, bombs, rockets)
* Vulnerable to flipping at high speeds
* Cannot shoot straight ahead due to driving compartment
* Very high recoil, making it hard to shoot at the same place twice
* Limited ammo count, meaning that ammo runs out quite fast if used recklessly

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Soviet mobile anti-aircraft defences in World War II was quite lacking in comparison to other nation's. Their self-propelled anti-aircraft guns are mainly improvised truck beds mounting a light anti-aircraft gun, such as Maxim machine guns on the [[GAZ-AAA (4M)]] and a single 25 mm autocannon in the [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]]. By the end of 1943, the design bureau at Plant no.88 wanted to mount two 25 mm 72-K guns onto a truck bed. The guidance system on the new design was derived from the 37 mm 61-K gun. The gun system was mounted onto the back of a ZIS-12 truck bed, which was derived from the ZIS-5 truck. In 1944, the weapon system was accepted for testing and later approved as the '''94-KM ZIS-12'''. Plant no.88 produced the 94-KM from 1944 to 1945 before stopping at either production number 225 or 237, possibly due to the introduction of the better [[ZSU-37]] anti-aircraft system.
