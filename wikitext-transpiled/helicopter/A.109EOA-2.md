== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The Agusta A109 is a multi-role utility helicopter made by Italy. The company known as Agusta, which were known for making motorbikes and various different helicopters such as the Agusta-Bell AB-205 and the Agusta A-129 Mangusta would create this helicopter mainly because they were looking to break into the export market. Mainly intended for commercial use and a civilian market, when designing this helicopter Agusta quickly realised that the specifications could be slightly altered and also allow the platform to be marketed for military roles. By 1973, the first ever military prototype of the Agusta A109 was presented, and various armaments would begin to be integrated in the following years, such as TOW ATGMs.

Introduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]], the A109 can pose a serious threat against the enemy team. You have the ability to mount up to 4 missiles at once, with the option of being able to also mount gunpods or extra rocket pods. The flight performance for this helicopter is one of the best for its battle rating, and due to all the empty space it is also able to withstand a number of hits before being rendered unable to keep on fighting. Keep in mind that you don't have access to countermeasures, so any missile AA will make short work of you if you are not paying attention. One of the main issues players might face with this helicopter is unlocking the TOW missiles; although the A109 gets rockets stock, they are very limited and very hard to aim at enemy vehicles. For best results, prioritize taking out light tanks and enemy aircraft which are not alerted by you.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

Outfitting the A.109 with general payload options (TOW ATGMs, rockets, gunpods) does not make the helicopter any slower than its adversaries, in fact at times you'll easily be one of the fastest helicopters on the battlefield. The A.109 is at times able to do manoeuvres other helicopters can only dream about, even with full payload options. In Ground RB matches however, there should not be many times you'll have to move too much to avoid enemies. You are able to get to good positions thanks to your speed and at times you will be able to dodge incoming missiles from ground anti-air or enemy jet aircraft.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->

The A.109 is not very survivable. Like many helicopters above and below its battle rating, it is prone to exploding into many pieces after a hit from an anti-air missile or a barrage of anti-air fire. It does not have any armour. If your enemy is not very accurate and manages to damage you without hitting key components of the helicopter, you might luck out and be able to make it back to the base to repair. It is advised that you stay away from machine gun fire too, generally just stay away from everything that poses a threat, this is the only way to truly maximize your survivability.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The A.109 is a great helicopter for its battle rating, there are great line-up options to pair the helicopter up with, and if you manage to get down-tiered you just might be able to easily dominate the game.

For Ground RB, it is recommended you bring in a light vehicle able to scout, with access to the "Air strike" modification. This will mean that once you have captured a point, and scouted a vehicle, you'll be able to get into the helicopter with TOW-2's (once you've researched them) straight away if you happen to get knocked out early. This is the best strategy as if you manage to pull it off in a match that has only just started, you will likely surprise unsuspecting enemies who might think it's still to early to worry about enemy aircraft. At the battle rating, you have access to the Centauro ROMOR, so this vehicle will be the one in which you should use to quickly get inside a helicopter.

With enough spawn points, you can bring the best overall load-out for the A.109: 4 x BGM-71C Improved TOW missiles + 14 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets. With the TOW ATGM, you'll easily be able to pick off players from a distance. If spawning in during the early minutes of a match, the TOW will be a dangerous weapon for pretty much any enemy vehicle you'll be able to hit. Do keep in mind who exactly you are choosing to engage, as you'll realise soon enough that killing a player with spawn points backed up will usually lead them to spawn in either an anti-air ground vehicle or an aircraft. In that case you'll get overwhelmed with everything you need to watch out for, which will lead you to be less effective in the CAS department for your team.

If you run out of TOW's during your match, it is advised you return to base to get rearmed. You only have access to 4 of them so every shot you take counts. If not, and you haven't had the chance to use your rocket pods yet, there can be situations where you'll be able to utilize them whilst still being useful to your team. With rockets, you'll need to stay low to avoid any incoming SPAA. You'll need to do that as the helicopter is not very armoured, so most if not all ground targets will easily make short work of you if you are not careful. Generally speaking sticking behind mountains or tree lines will suffice. Once you feel you've gotten close enough to the battlefield, it's time for you to come out, quickly find your targets, and engage. This might pose a challenge as the A.109 doesn't have access to many rockets, so you'll need to pick your targets carefully and make sure most of your shots actually land and hit your targets.

The A.109 doesn't have any main cannon/machine guns but it is good to note you are able to bring in gunpods in replacement of the rockets. These gunpods aren't very effective against ground targets, but they should be more than enough to defend yourself from incoming enemy air vehicles. Against enemy air vehicles they will be your only line of defense, as the A.109 does not have access to air-to-air missiles or flares/chaff, so if you're not careful you could become a very easy kill for them. The main problem with trying to engage at close range is that doing so in most cases will put the A.109 in huge amounts of danger. Survivability features of the A.109 are poor, as previously mentioned enemy tanks and SPAAs will be able to quickly destroy the helicopter with their main guns or machine guns, so it is recommended that you only get into the actual battlefield near the end of the battle, once most threats you'll encounter will not be present, or at the very least, threats that can be dealt with safely.

In '''Arcade Assault''', you won't have to worry about going back to base to reload your weapons as they will automatically replenish once every munition has been used up. It's recommended you bring either TOW ATGM + rockets, or rockets + gunpods, or a full load-out of rockets. This is so as to maximize your overall effectiveness for your team.

'''Helicopter Battles'''

When playing helicopter battles, your best shot at staying alive and being effective is to bring a load-out of gunpods and rockets. The gunpods you have access to are usually able to deal with most helicopters you'll be facing, due to many of them not being very armoured. With rockets, you'll be able to take out ground AI targets. Usually, they will take 1 or 2 shots at minimum to destroy. Rockets are also quite effective in close range as a last ditch effort to come out on top when fighting a 1-vs-1. Try stay away from any helicopters with air-to-air missiles as you'll more than likely get destroyed, best way to maximize your efforts in this game mode is by trying and flanking the enemy side of the map and getting rid of ground targets undisturbed.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

During the 1960s, Agusta was looking to break into the export market by designing the A109. Mainly intended for commercial use and a civilian market, it would be also later be tailored during development to the military market. It was redesigned in 1969 as there was a need for twin engines to actually compete with other contenders: this lead to the A109 to be fitted with 2 Allison 250-C14 turboshaft engines. From December 1968 until September 1969, at least 10 separate possible configurations were worked out. This lead to construction of the first three of the prototypes to carry out flight tests. In 1971, the A109 made its first maiden flight which yielded great results for the machine. The test flight was encouraging both in regards the reduction of vibration and handling qualities, and the overall advantage achieved by adopting an articulated four-blade rotor. Noise abatement was also promising, with an especially designed markedly tapered leading edge of the blade tip section. Testing was halted following a minor accident but quickly resumed in 1972 with to the demand and interest of many countries.
[[File:A.109EOA-2.png|thumb|A.109EOA-2 at helipad in Italy]]
Finally, in 1973, the first ever military prototype was presented along with its possible configurations, this officially changed the vehicle from being centred only for civilian use, and allowed it to gain the reputation of also being for military purposes. Many tests were conducted on the military versions of the A109, the first set of armaments being equipped on them were Hughes Aircraft-built anti-tank TOW missiles. The A109 was also tested with a wide variety of rockets, machine guns and any weaponry that could be installed on the machine. Between 1976 and 1977, the tests that were conducted allowed 2 different military variants to emerge, one of them being for light attack/close support missions and the other one for shipboard operations.

Once Agusta's helicopter was ready, many civilian versions of this aircraft started being exported around the globe, mainly in the Middle East and Africa. In Italy, the Army obtained the A109CM as the "A109EOA" utility/scout helicopter, with "EOA" standing for "Elicottero d'Osservazione Avanzata" ("Advanced Observation Helicopter"). This helicopter's entry into service helped put out of service the very old Agusta-Bell helicopters that were, at the time, still used in a multi-role aspect. In Italian service, the A109 was able to carry rockets, various ATGMs, and gunpods. The launchers installed on the A109 allowed for the installation of TOW, ITOW, TOW2 and TOW2A missiles. Other armaments included 12.7 mm general purpose door-mounted machine guns on both sides of the helicopter, allowing the vehicle to be very versatile and well-defended. Initial variants of the A109 usually lacked any form of countermeasures, but these would be installed in more modern variants of the helicopter. It was in service for a very long time, and was liked by those who operated the vehicle. Some export variants of the A109 included special options such as the A109BA, which was exported to Belgium, equipped with 8 x TOW launcher instead of the 4 x one in service in Italy. Currently, 32 additional countries are using the A109 either in civilian or military configurations. The A109 keeps on being in service and continues to be upgraded to not lag behind other countries' helicopters to this day.

=== [[wt:en/news/6989-development-italian-helicopters-en|Devblog]] ===
In the early 70s, the Italian aircraft manufacturer Agusta began testing a new multi-purpose helicopter, the A.109, which was originally created for the civilian market, but immediately drew the attention of the military authorities. A.109 EOA-2 is a reconnaissance version, designed to destroy various targets including enemy armoured vehicles. In addition to machine-gun pods and rockets, the helicopter can be equipped with four TOW anti-tank missile launchers.
