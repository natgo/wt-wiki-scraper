== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', commonly referred to by its nickname 超級眼鏡蛇 (Super Cobra), is one of the main attack helicopters of the ROCA. To upgrade the ROCA against any potential risks, Taiwan imported a number of AH-1Ws from the US to form the basis of their new attack helicopter brigades in 1992. With upgrades in the 2010s and an abundance of spare parts for up to 12 years, these helicopters are likely to continue being the main component of their helicopter fleet alongside the AH-64E Apache Guardian purchased in the early 2010s.

Introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]], the AH-1W has a number of welcome features, such as an onboard autocannon for soft targets, AIM-9Ls, and a large payload of Hellfire missiles. While it might not be as fast or effective in terms of air defence as its PLAGF counterparts, it still boasts high speed and good manoeuvrability, and can serve as a more flexible alternative to the Z-9 series. Additionally, the AH-1W is equipped with a MAW system which will automatically release countermeasures if a heat-seeking missile is launched at the helicopter, and an IRCM system creates jamming for IR missiles' seeker heads.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
To further enhance the combat capabilities of the Super Cobra, instead of the standard single-engine on AH-1G/F/S, the Super Cobra has two instead; in this case, two General Electric T700-401 turboshaft engines for the AH-1W variant. This obviously make AH-1W vastly faster than its single-engine cousins and now, faster than its Z-9 Haitun counterparts in PLAGF service; it is heavier than the Z-9 series indeed as a dedicated attack helicopter, but it is not as heavy as "gunships" of Soviet Union/Russia, namely the Hind series.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
The AH-1W is an armoured attack helicopter offering protection to the crew and engine:

* Composite boron carbide- Kevlar seat enclosures, for both of the crew, with a thickness of 20 mm.
* A steel seat, which offers a thickness of 12 mm for the pilot only.
* Steel plate covers, offering 12 mm of thickness over the turboshaft engine.

The AH-1W compensates with its small size compared to the Mi-24 Hinds which are incredibly well armoured but are huge and much less nimble in comparison. However, the AH-1W does not protect all of its critical components, such as the fuel tanks, transmission, propeller shaft, and control surfaces, with armour plating, nor does it have armoured glass installed around the cockpit.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|M197 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between two presets:
** 1 x 20 mm M197 cannon (750 rpg) + 60 x countermeasures
** 1 x 20 mm M197 cannon + 60 x countermeasures + IRCM

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

Thanks to the FCS upgrade for the AH-1W series, aside from conventional loadouts identical to AH-1S, AH-1W can now carry AAMs like AIM-9L while carrying more advanced AGM-114B Hellfire, as well as higher caliber Zuni rockets for ground attacks; leaving it more flexible than previous Cobra series.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Pleasing armaments
** Fixed autocannon for taking down "soft" targets, a lacking feature for most PLAGF helicopters
** Powerful AIM-9L for higher kill-probability
** Sufficient secondary loadout for different tactics
* TVD for target acquisition
* More protected than PLAGF counterpart at similar tier
* IRCM equipment for more survivability
* Faster than Z-9 series

'''Cons:'''

* Less agile than PLAGF counterparts due to the weight
* Lacks more advanced optics with high magnification
* Only two AAMs available which calls for careful, planned launches for best chances
* Early wire-guided ATGM hinders combat capability

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
By 1990s, ROCA only has UH-1H assembled by AIDC as their fleet of helicopters mostly for transport purpose; in view of the establishment of PLAGF Aviation Corps and modernization of ROCA for the potential outbreak of cross-strait war, ROCA "Army Aviation Command and Training Center" ('''陸軍航空指揮部暨航空訓練中心''') started the introduction of attack helicopters in 1992 alongside with their two new army aviation brigades and their [[OH-58D (China)|OH-58D]]. The deal was approved in February with 42 AH-1Ws and further 21 helicopters were delivered in 2001, totaled at 63 helicopters imported from US.

Although two helicopters (515; 526) and 4 of their crews were lost throughout its service in ROCA, due to the extremely high cost to replace all AH-1W with more advanced AH-64E and having sufficient spare parts for up to 12 years of use as disclosed in mid-2010s, the AH-1W will now serve alongside with its long-time partner OH-58D at Taichung Xinshe airfield by the '''602nd Aviation Brigade, Army Aviation and Special Forces Command''' to defend Central Taiwan if the worst scenario happens.

As the AH-1 Cobra entered service with the Army, the USMC expressed their interest in acquiring Cobras for their own use. However, these Cobras would have to be twin-engined and possess a more capable primary armament to meet the Marines' service requirements. Despite initial hesitation from the Department of Defense, the Marines received the go-ahead and proceeded with awarding Bell with a contract to produce 49 AH-1J Sea Cobras in May 1968.

Similarly to the Army, the USMC also perceived the AH-1 as an interim vehicle, until a more suitable replacement could be found. Whilst this replacement would come to the Army in the form of the AH-64 Apache, the USMC's request to upgrade their fleet with a naval version of the Apache would be met with disapproval by the Congress in 1981, thus forcing the Marines to look into other options. The decision was therefore made to upgrade the existing fleet with new AH-1W Super Cobras, which featured an improved fire control system and the ability to carry more advanced ordnance.
