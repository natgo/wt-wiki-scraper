== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Greece agreed to acquire the American AH-64A Apache when they signed a contract in December 24, 1991 for 12 AH-64As, and another one in 1992 for 8 AH-64A+. The 20 AH-64As were delivered by 1995 and continue to serve with the Hellenic Air Force up to today, alongside 12 [[AH-64D]] ordered in 2003.

Introduced in [[Update "Fire and Ice"]], the AH-64A (GR) is a premium vehicle in the US helicopter tech tree. Compared to the Israeli AH-64A also in the premium tech tree. the AH-64A (GR) shares the same loadout options as the [[AH-64A]] in the standard tech tree.  In addition to powerful Hellfires and Stingers, there is also the APKWS II missiles with a laser guidance system and a high-explosive/anti-tank warhead, capable of striking targets up to 11 km away, making them particularly effective against anti-aircraft systems. The AH-64A (GR) also comes with premium bonuses, which allows for faster progression through the American helicopter tech tree.

=== Survivability and armour ===
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}

The AH-64A Apache has armour that consists of bulletproof glass in the pilot's windscreen and Kevlar boron carbide in the crew seats and cockpit. This armour provides limited protection, mainly against low-calibre weapons and fragmentation. It is not very effective against direct hits from guns larger than machine guns or against close detonations from fused anti-aircraft rounds.

* 22 mm bulletproof glass - pilot's windscreen
* 20 mm Kevlar boron carbide - pilot & gunner seats, cockpit floor and side panels

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Overview:'''

The AH-64A (GR) is a formidable helicopter that dominates the battlefield with its accurate and deadly long-range attack capabilities. It carries powerful Hellfire missiles, known for their exceptional precision and reliability, allowing for precise strikes against enemy positions. It also has effective Hydra rockets that can easily destroy lightly armored targets and deal with various threats. Moreover, the AH-64A (GR) has a versatile 30mm cannon that can engage both ground and air targets, increasing its flexibility and combat performance.

'''Long Range Air-to-Ground combat:'''

The Apache's armament, which consists of AGM-114s, enables the helicopter to be deadly at long ranges. However, SPAA at this tier can effectively counter the Apache's attacks, making it a challenging helicopter to fly. The Apache's agility and speed make it a difficult target to hit, but experienced SPAA operators can still take it down with well-placed shots. Moreover, the Apache's weapons rely on line-of-sight, which means that terrain and obstacles can easily block them. Despite these weaknesses, the Apache remains a formidable force on the battlefield, capable of taking out multiple targets with precision strikes. The Apache is a versatile and lethal helicopter that requires skilled operators to fully utilize its capabilities while avoiding its vulnerabilities.

'''Using Rockets:'''

The AH-64A (GR) is a state-of-the-art helicopter that features the Hydra rocket system with CCIP technology. This powerful weapon enables players to attack multiple targets at the same time with high accuracy by using the CCIP computer. The rockets are user-friendly and effective in different combat scenarios, whether players are flying low and fast or staying at a safe distance.

'''Air-to-Air Combat:'''

The helicopter has limited capabilities to fight against jets and other helicopters, so players should avoid air-to-air combat unless necessary.

The Stinger (AIM-92) missile is best used from a distance against unaware enemies because it can be easily dodged. The AIM-9L missile has better speed and maneuverability, but it is more vulnerable to flares due to the lack of IRCCM. The 30 mm cannon can be used for self-defense in dire situations, but these should be avoided.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
'''Pros:'''

* Access to potent AGM-114B missiles, Hydra rockets, and APWKS missiles.
* IRCM and RWR allowing quick reaction in case of attack.
* Adequate speed and agility
* Good durability; can take a few hits.

'''Cons:'''

* Air-to-air performance is inadequate compared to its adversaries
* Very few countermeasures
