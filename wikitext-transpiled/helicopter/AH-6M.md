== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''AH-6M Little Bird''' (nicknamed the Killer Egg) is a class of light helicopters utilized primarily for special operations by the U.S. Army. The prototype was designed to compete in U.S. Army Technical Specification 153 in 1960 for a Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) that could perform personnel extraction, scouting, and light attacks to replace the existing Bell H-13 Sioux fleet. The Hughes Model 369 competed against two other prototypes, developed by Fairchild-Hiller and Bell, for a production contract. The Hughes Model 369 had its maiden flight on February 27, 1963. The teardrop-shaped fuselage provided excellent external visibility, and thanks to its four-bladed, fully articulated primary rotor, it was incredibly agile, making it excellent for personnel extraction, scouting, and light attacks. Hughes was given a production contract by the U.S. Army in May 1965. A gunship variant, known as the AH-6, was painted black primarily for night-time operations.

Introduced in [[Update "Sky Guardians"]], the AH-6M is a twin-seat (gunner and pilot next to each other) light helicopter that can carry a capacity of up to six passengers. With a diverse arsenal of weapons at its disposal, the AH-6M can conduct a wide range of missions in the game, from scouting to anti-armour. With its exceptional manoeuvrability and small size, it possesses remarkable agility and is capable of performing extreme evasive manoeuvres that most other helicopters cannot. With its thermal imaging device and ballistic computer, it can readily scout for targets for the friendly team and provide close air support with Hydra-70 M247 rockets when necessary. The AGR-20 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS), which converts standard unguided Hydra-70 M247 rockets into precision-guided munitions, is also available for the AH-6M. This enables the helicopter to precisely eliminate lightly armoured targets from a distance, making it a more "economic" alternative when the AGM-114 Hellfire can be saved for heavier armoured adversaries.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The AH-6M Littlebird is a great attack helicopter for close air support. Its speed, agility, and small size allow it to make use of cover behind small buildings and hide from enemy tanks and aircraft.

The AH-6M Littlebird has options to carry 7.62 mm Miniguns with Hydra-70 rockets, APKWS, or AGM-114 Missiles. You cannot use both the 7.62 mm Minigun with the 12.7 Minigun on the same side.

Use the AH-6M's excellent manoeuvrability and small size to evade enemy fire. Favour unpredictable flight paths, low-altitude flying, and sudden changes in direction to make yourself a difficult target.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very agile
* Thermal vision device
* 360Â° laser
* Wide cockpit view

'''Cons:'''

* No armour
* No countermeasures
* Limited loadout options
