== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German utility helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5824-development-bo-105-attack-helicopters-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]] and was removed from sale after the [[wt:en/news/6542-shop-the-new-year-sale-en|2019 New Year sale]].

=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.''

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|BGM-71C Improved TOW|FFAR Mighty Mouse|FN M3P (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 8 x BGM-71C Improved TOW missiles
- 60 x countermeasures + 2 x 12.7 mm FN M3P machine guns (400 rpg = 800 total)
- 60 x countermeasures + 2 x 12.7 mm FN M3P machine guns + 6 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets
- 30 x countermeasures + 1 x 12.7 mm FN M3P machine gun + 4 x BGM-71C Improved TOW missiles
- 30 x countermeasures + 1 x 12.7 mm FN M3P machine gun + 4 x BGM-71C Improved TOW missiles + 3 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The two main armaments that you will end up using are the 8 [[BGM-71 TOW|BGM-71]] TOWs and the 4 [[BGM-71 TOW|BGM-71]] TOWs with the FN F3P gun pod with the three FFAR Mighty Mouses. The first load out is used as an early game strike load out when there is a lack of enemy SPAA, helicopters, and planes. The second load out is used in the mid game and late game time frames when there are vehicles that can shoot you down.

When using the TOWs there are a couple of ways to play with them. The first is the standard hover behind a mountain or hill then fly up fire one or two missiles than reposition and repeat. Another way to play is similar to the [[SA.313B Alouette II (Germany)|SA.313B Alouette]] where you will put your collective between 50%-60% and angle down and as you fly over the battlefield you strike enemy tank, this strategy requires a bit of luck and knowledge of how the BGM-71 TOWs work.

Another way to play is to carry the two FN F3P gun pods with the six FFAR Mighty Mouses and use ground belts to strike lightly armoured vehicles such as the BMPs, [[Object 685]], [[Rooikat Mk.1D|Rooikat]], and [[HSTV-L]].

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Small fuselage that is harder to hit
- Very good manoeuvrability
- Highest ATGM count of the premium V era helicopters

'''Cons:'''

- Slower speed than most attack helicopters

== History ==
''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''

== Media ==

<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->
