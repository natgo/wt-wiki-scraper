== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

Fully spaded without load this attack helicopter can fly 315 km/h in cruise speed. In reality with the most common load of 8 x Hellfire missiles and 4 x Mistrals is reaching almost 300 km/h which is still really great. Tiger itself requires skill to fly. Proper manipulation of collective pitch and understanding in what circumstances you as a pilot cannot overload the engines and how to perform aggressive manoeuvres (especially on low attitudes and against planes) will make this machine extremely deadly. Tiger feels heavy but agile at the same time.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
This is one of the best-protected helicopters in the game, thanks to the composite tub around the crew and the firewall separating the 2 engines. To make use of this, when attacked by plane, the best option is to face it frontally to create the smallest possible area to hit. But like every helicopter damaged near engines, the main rotor or tail ([[OTOMATIC]]'s rain of explosive shells is very dangerous) can be taken down fairly quickly.

* AMAP-AIR, Advanced Modular Armour Protection - Air: Composite martial encloses all the crew compartment - 20 mm thick
* Kevlar seats - 5 mm thick
* Single steel firewall between the engines - 8 mm thick

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|GIAT M781 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between two presets:
** 1 x 30 mm GIAT M781 cannon (450 rpg)
** 1 x 30 mm GIAT M781 cannon + 60 x countermeasures

The 30 mm cannon only fires high explosive ammo (4 mm penetration), so it is advised only to use it against aircraft and light-armoured, open-topped vehicles.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AGM-114K Hellfire II|ATAS (AIM-92)|HOT-3|Mistral|SNEB type 23}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance presets:

* Without load
* 44 x SNEB type 23 rockets
* 68 x SNEB type 23 rockets
* 4 x HOT-3 missiles
* 8 x HOT-3 missiles
* 4 x AGM-114K Hellfire II missiles
* 8 x AGM-114K Hellfire II missiles
* 4 x ATAS (AIM-92) missiles
* 4 x Mistral missiles

=== Defensive systems ===
<!--''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.''-->
The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' only has the following Defensive systems installed:

*'''Flares''' - installs 60 Flares.
*'''MAW''' - Missile Approach Warning system.
*'''ATAM''' - Air To Air Missile.

The '''MAW''' system allows for 60 Flares to be installed, along with warnings that missiles have been launched.
The '''ATAM''' allows for the Mistral air-to-air missile to be installed, these are installed on each wing's hard point, which means 50% of the available hard points are used by the mistral air-to-air missiles, meaning the suspended armament are reduced by half. However, the Mistral missiles are one of the best missiles in the game, able to destroy anything which it locks on to.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

For Realistic and Simulation Battles, the best tactic is to stay as low as possible and at first perform reconnaissance. If you start with the helicopter, your first goal is to find and take down enemy helicopters on flanks (don't bother on ones over the battlefield, as you will most likely be destroyed by anti-aircraft fire). It is best to use flares before you think you might need them, as firing them too late are a very common mistake that helicopter pilots make, as when the red launch is an indication that it already may be too late.

The second task is to find good flank position or behind if possible (watch out for helipads anti-aircraft fire) spot to scan for potential ground enemies. Targeting sight on top of the cabin called STRIX gives the possibility to stay low and watch the area around. Use thermal vision, but don't hesitate to switch back to normal view (especially while shooting HOT-3 missiles, which might cause light-bloom and obscure your view in thermal-mode). The Tiger can carry up to 8 x Hellfire missiles. The biggest advantage of AGM-114 is the fact that while shooting they do not give up and will continue to seek the enemy's helicopter position until the fuel runs out, unlike others directly shot ATGMs. In terms of effectiveness, it can be very deadly but only when know how to use it, however since Hellfire attacks from the top it might be hard to hit moving targets with it. The best way is to aim and shoot behind or before the target and in the last moment re-aim on the enemy (typically around four seconds before hit-this technique requires practice). This might make your chance higher to directly hit the enemy on the move. Once again stay low, between buildings, trees, almost on the ground if necessary, listen to the sky for planes sound. Don't stay in gunner's view too long. Watch what's going on around you all the time. Eurocopter Tiger HAD has all the tools to fight with air and ground and to survive. Use all tools, bind all keys for easy access (flares, hoover mode, aim, and launch AA mistrals). It's a high learning curve, high reward, deadly machine.
=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Tough airframe, can withstand multiple hits from [[9K127 Vikhr]] missiles
*Very agile and fast
*Great manoeuvrability at low speeds
*Great payload selection
*Mistral missiles are some of the best in-game air to missiles, great range and lock-on

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks the same level of defensive systems as on rival platforms from [[AH-64D| NATO AH-64D Longbow]] and [[Ka-52|Russia's Ka-52 Alligator]]
* Only has four wing mounts, compared to the six on the [[AH-64D|American AH-64D Longbow]] and [[Ka-52|Russia's Ka-52 Alligator]]
* Only 8 ATGMs compared to its contemporaries with 12 or even 16 ATGMs

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The '''EC-665 Tiger HAD''' is an improved model of the Tiger HAP. HAD stands for Hélicoptère d'Appui Destruction in French and Helicóptero de Apoyo y Destrucción in Spanish for "Support and Destruction Helicopter". The Spanish Army ordered 24 Tiger HADs in 2004, while the French Army Light Aviation (ALAT) ordered 40. France also decided to upgrade their existing Tiger HAPs to the HAD standard starting in 2015.

The Tiger HAD is mostly similar to the earlier Tiger HAP, but with more powerful Enhanced MTR390 engines with 14% more engine power. This increased the maximum takeoff weight to 6,600 kg. Additionally, the communications suite was expanded with an Up Link and Down Link satellite antenna. The ballistic protection was also increased due to a request by the Spanish Army.

The armament consists of a 30 mm Nexter (formerly GIAT) M781 nose-mounted gun turret, and either 68 mm SNEB or 70 mm Hydra 70 rockets, Hellfire II anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), or Mistral air-to-air missiles in French service. Other armaments are available for the Spanish helicopters; they use the Spike-ER rather than the Hellfire II ATGMs. The EC-665 Tiger HAD can be used in the attack, escort, fire support, reconnaissance, and air-to-air combat roles.

Spanish Tiger HADs were deployed to Afghanistan in March 2013, in order to support the Spanish ground forces that were already there. The first French combat deployment of the Tiger HAD was to Mali in November 2014, as support for the French intervention in the Mali War; they were sent to Mali after being deemed combat capable.
