== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} British utility helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/6320-development-britain-s-top-lynx-ah-mk-1-and-premium-g-lynx-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]]. It was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6924-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-in-gaijin-net-store-en|8th Anniversary Sale]], and was reintroduced in [[Update "Hot Tracks"]] as a Golden Eagle {{ge}} purchasable vehicle.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The G-LYNX is a fast and nimble helicopter, being able to achieve speeds many other helicopters can't get to. It also is able to perform many manoeuvres that many other heavier helicopters can't accomplish.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->

The G-LYNX lacks any armour protection for the crew, and due to the size and placement of the fuel tanks the helicopter can be set on fire easily. It does support the choice of mounting 192 flares to the helicopter, giving it a way to dodge incoming IR-seeking air-to-air missiles.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|AGM-114B Hellfire|ATAS (AIM-92)|BGM-71 TOW-2|Hydra-70 M247|Oerlikon KAD-B (20 mm)}}

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

'''Ground RB'''

The G-LYNX is a great helicopter to take out in ground RB due to its loadout of 8 Hellfires. While many other helicopters like the [[AH-1Z]] can carry twice as many, the G-LYNX can do so while retaining its decent manoeuvrability and speed. It also is equipped with a thermal view for the ATGM shooter camera, making it easy to spot enemies on the ground and in the air. The Hellfires can be ripple fired, making destroying multiple open targets really easy. There is also a choice to take out TOW-2 missiles, which offer better control than the Hellfires, with the tradeoff of being slower and having less range (3.75 km, compared to the AGM-114's 8 km). The G-LYNX also supports Hydra-70 unguided rockets, which you get 38 of. These can be used at close range to great effect, although at longer ranges it is hard to aim them due to the lack of a [[Ballistic Computer]] onboard.

In terms of air-to-air armament, the G-LYNX sports the choice of 4 AIM-92 Stingers, or 2 AIM-92 Stingers and a single [[Oerlikon KAD-B (20 mm)|20 mm Oerlikon KAD-B cannon]] with 570 rounds of ammo. The latter is usually preferred due to the unreliability of the Stinger missiles. The Stingers might not kill the target with a hit, or the target might have countermeasures against IR-seeking missiles. With this it would leave the G-LYNX defenceless against aerial targets. That's why equipping the 20 mm cannon over the 2 extra missiles is a good choice. It can deal with aircraft who get too close.

'''Helicopter Battles (Arcade)'''

While the G-LYNX does sport Stingers to deal with enemy helicopters, they are unreliable to use in the Heli EC gamemode. The Hellfires can really deal with close range targets as with long range targets, the missiles would take a top down approach, making it highly likely to miss the enemy. The TOW-2s would be a good way to down enemy helicopters, but leading them is quite hard and it will likely result in a miss. As it is with Ground RB, the gun is again really important for the armament of the G-LYNX. Being able to defend against helicopters who get too close for missiles is a good thing.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Hellfire missiles that are great for ground targets.
- Thermal sight.
- Good manoeuvrability.
- Perfect control at high speed (400 km/h).
- Fastest helicopter in the game

'''Cons:'''

- The main gun is fixed on the airframe.
- Doesn't have any long range AA armament (over 6 km).
- Stinger air-to-air missiles are inherently unreliable, especially at ranges above 1 km

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Development on the Lynx began in the mid 1960s, when Westland sought a replacement for its existing Scout and Wasp helicopters, while also wanting to provide a more advanced alternative to the UH-1 Iroquois.

After some delays, the first prototype was ready for testing by the early '70s. In March 1971, the prototype conducted its maiden flight. In further sorties, the Lynx managed to break a number of world speed records for helicopters. Quite content with the Lynx's performance, the British Army placed an order for 100 units of the type to be produced in the mid '70s. Subsequently, the Lynx received its official army designation 'Lynx AH Mk.1'.

Since its introduction to service, the Lynx saw service primarily with the British Army and the Royal Navy in various different roles, including among others transport, armed escort and anti-tank warfare. Furthermore, the Lynx also saw service with countries such as the Netherlands, Norway and Argentina, while other countries like Germany, France, Denmark, South Korea, Brazil and Portugal, to name a few, still use variants of the Lynx today.

During their service, Lynx helicopters found themselves taking part in numerous conflicts, including the Falklands and Gulf wars, military interventions on the Balkans during the 1990s, anti-piracy efforts in Somalia and many more thanks to their ongoing service today. In total, around 450 Lynx helicopters of various modifications have been produced by 2009, with production still ongoing today.
