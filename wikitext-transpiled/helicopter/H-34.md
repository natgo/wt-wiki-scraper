== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.91 "Night Vision"]] as a reward for the 2019 [[wt:en/news/6409-special-operation-shipyard-en|Operation Shipyard]] event. It is a rare vehicle and currently only obtainable through the [[War Thunder Market]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.''

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 4 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns (500 rpg = 2,000 total) + 32 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets
- 2 x 20 mm M3 cannons (200 rpg = 400 total) + 2 x 12.7 mm M3 Browning machine guns (250 rpg = 500 total) + 4 x 7.62 mm Browning machine guns (250 rpg = 1,000 total) + 40 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets + 2 x HVAR rockets
- 1 x 20 mm Mk 11 cannon (400 rpg) + 1 x AGM-12B Bullpup missile

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- ATGM is really useful
- Descends quickly, allowing you to dodge AA fire from afar

'''Cons:'''

- Poor flight characteristics, not as manoeuvrable as other American helicopters
- Will descend really fast at ~25 km/s if the col is at 0% for too long, which is a death sentence if low to the ground

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

[[File:H-34 Landing.jpg|thumb|400x400px|H-34 Choctaw of the United States Army.]]
The Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw was an American utility, transport and ground attack helicopter. First flown in 1954, its versatility led to it being used by all branches of the American armed forces. As well, it enjoyed widespread use in the air forces of numerous other nations, including some aircraft converted into commercial airlift and transport vehicles. The helicopter also saw service in the Vietnam war, where it became one of the first helicopters utilized as a weapons platform and gunship. Roughly 1,800 Choctaws were produced.<ref name=":0">Dnewbold. (2016)</ref><ref name=":1">Staff Writer. (2018)</ref>

=== Design and development ===
The H-34 Choctaw was designed as a derivative of Sikorsky's earlier H-19 Chickasaw.<ref name=":1" /> The helicopter featured a new tail-dragger landing gear design, but retained most of its predecessor's features including the nose-mounted radial engine. The helicopter was flown by a crew of two, with an optional third machine gunner if carrying weapons.<ref name=":0" /> Powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine, the helicopter could travel at a mediocre maximum speed of 198 km/h,<ref name=":0" /> and could carry up to 1,350 kilograms of cargo or 16 fully-loaded troops. The Choctaw made its first flight on March 8th, 1954.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

=== Operational history ===
After the completion of testing, the H-34 was ordered and used by the US Navy as an anti submarine warfare and transport helicopter.<ref name=":1" /> It was designated the HSS-1 Seabat in its anti-submarine configuration and HUS-1 Seahorse in its transport configuration.<ref name=":1" /> The US Army and Marine Corps also purchased the helicopter in 1955 and 1957, respectively; the Army was responsible for its name, "Choctaw".<ref name=":1" /> Following the introduction of the Tri-Service designation system, the helicopters were collectively known as the H-34; the Seabat became the SH-34, the Choctaw the CH-34 and the Seahorse the UH-34.<ref name=":1" />

The Choctaw went on to serve in the Vietnam war in a variety of roles, ranging from MEDEVAC to transport. The helicopter was highly popular due to its ruggedness and versatility, and was employed on a variety of missions. However, the role that would have the greatest impact on future helicopter design was the ground attack role. Some Choctaws were converted into offensive weapons platforms, carrying a mix of machine guns and rockets mounted outside the hull. These helis were known as 'Stingers'.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Though ineffective, the helicopter's design made it America's first attack helicopter. The weapons kits would eventually be inherited by the [[UH-1 (Family)|UH-1E]] Huey, and affected later designs such as the [[AH-1 (Family)|AH-1]] Cobra and [[AH-64A|AH-64]] Apache.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

The Choctaw also enjoyed extensive service with foreign countries, serving with the militaries of at least 27 different nations. However, its next two largest operators (after the United States) were France and the United Kingdom. France received [[H-34 (France)|134 Choctaws]] from the United States, and built many more; these aircraft served in the French-Algerian war where it was used as a troop transport.<ref name=":0" /> The United Kingdom also procured Choctaws, which were produced by Westland Aviation as the Westland Wessex.<ref name=":0" /> Many additional Choctaws were built for civilian use, including transport and airliner models.

Over 1,800 Choctaws were built between 1954 and 1970,<ref name=":0" /> while production continued even later with foreign-built helicopters. Though it has been largely retired from military service, a considerable amount of Choctaws remain in commercial service.<ref name=":1" /> Many Choctaws are held in museums and private collections, mostly in the United States but also abroad.<ref name=":1" />
