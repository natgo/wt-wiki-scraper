== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Helikopter 2''' (HKP2) was the Swedish designation for the French [[SA 313B Alouette II|SA 313 Alouette II]]. The first SA 313 arrived in Sweden in 1957, for use as a civilian crop duster. The helicopter was quickly adopted into the armed forces, serving with the army, air force, and navy. In total, Sweden operated 29 HKP2 helicopters, including 10 licence-built by SAAB in Norrk√∂ping, which remained in service until 1988 when it was finally replaced in army service by the [[HKP9A|HKP9]].

Introduced in [[Update "Wind of Change"]], the '''HKP2''' is a light and manoeuvrable helicopter, but lacks armour. Its main difference from the French Alouettes lies in its landing gear: instead of skis, it uses floats for water landings. The armament remains the same - RB 52A ATGMs (Swedish version of the SS.11) with a range of 3.5 km, which necessitates flying close to the battlefield for deployment, exposing it to risk from anti-aircraft fire.

=== Survivability and armour ===

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->

<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 4 x RB 52 A missiles

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Can mount 4 ATGMs that are fairly decent for the BR
* Can land on water and land with its pontoons, which also makes it unique from other Alouette variants
* Small profile, makes for a harder target to hit
* Agile enough to dodge some autocannon fire or the occasional ATGM fired by ground vehicles
* Gets airspawn  due to being amphibious

'''Cons:'''

* No MGs, cannons, or rockets - limited to the 4 x ATGM loadout
* Low engine power, and the engine is not very responsive
* Fragile airframe which will not resist much more than glancing hits from MG caliber rounds

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
