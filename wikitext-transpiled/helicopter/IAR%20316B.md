== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French utility helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/6062-development-sa-316b-alouette-iii-the-high-flying-skylark-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6464-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-en|2019 Birthday Sale]].

Aérospatiale licensed the Romanian aircraft manufacturer Industria Aeronautică Româniă to build the SA.316B as the IAR 316B. Manufacturing began in 1971 in Brasov, Romania, with production ending in 1987. These helicopters were built with the Turbomeca Artouste IIIB powerplant. 250 total units were manufactured, with 125 remaining for use in with the Romanian military. The rest of the manufactured helicopters were exported to other nations including Pakistan, Angola, and Guinea.

The cockpit of the helicopter is built for both a pilot and co-pilot to operate with excellent views through the spacious glass canopy. Two cabin doors open to the passenger compartment, which can accommodate up to three passengers.

The IAR 316B was modified to carry weapon systems more readily available in the Eastern-bloc section of Europe to include 57 mm rocket pods, 7.62 mm machine guns and other anti-tank missiles.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.''

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|PKA (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 2 x 7.62 mm PKA machine guns (500 rpg = 1,000 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|9M14-2 Malyutka-2|S-5K}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 6 x 9M14-2 Malyutka-2 missiles + 32 x S-5K rockets

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Abundant arsenal of rockets and missiles, offering exceptional air-to-ground firepower
* Effective machine guns capable of providing defense against enemy helicopters

'''Cons:'''

* Absence of armor, requiring caution to avoid vulnerability to enemy attacks
* Limited secondary armament options, potentially restricting tactical versatility
* Machine guns are ineffective against heavily armored targets, necessitating alternative approaches for engaging such threats

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The IAR 316 was a training helicopter produced by the "Industria Aeronautica Românească" (in translation: "Romanian Aeronautics Industry") as a licensed version of the French "Aérospatiale Alouette III" (SA316 Alouette III Light Utility Helicopter). The production of this model started in 1971 at the IAR Factory in Ghimbav, Romania, and it was halted in 1987. A total of 250 helicopters were built, 125 for the Romanian Army, and the rest exported to countries like Pakistan, Angola, and Guinea. Some helicopters were even modified to use 57 mm rockets and Anti-Tank Guided Missiles.

There was an attempt to convert the original model of IAR 316 into an attack helicopter named IAR 317 "Airfox", however, only 1 prototype was ever built.
