== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->The Lahatut was acquired by the IAF after the Yom Kippur War being a very attractive option to increase the number of attack helicopters in service at a relatively low cost. The IAF already operated the Bell AH-1 Cobra. The IAF purchased a total of 36 units, 32 after live firing trials in 1977 and 6 more in 1984 after the first delivery was completed. In IAF service the MD-500 was equipped with a turret mounted electro-optical sight and four TOW missiles, two on each side of the fuselage, although these could be replaced by rocket launchers. The Lahatut has been used in counterterrorist operations in Southern Lebanon and in raids in Palestinian territory. They also engaged Syrian armour at the Beirut-Damascus highway, in one of the largest tank battles in Israeli history.

It was introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]]. The MD-500TOW platform is characterized for it's mobility, agility and in general being a very nimble helicopter. The Lahatut's biggest asset is it's size, being a small target compared to similar BR helicopters like the Mi-8TV, Tzefa B and Mi-24D, it's much harder to be detected or hit by enemy SPAA, which starts to become increasingly dangerous and precise around Rank V with the introduction of ground radars. The Lahatut can be armed with two main weapons, 14 x Hydra 70 rockets or 4 x BGM-71D TOW-2 missiles. The TOW-2 is one of the fastest helicopter based ATGMs at it's BR with 329m/s of speed, this, paired with it's excellent handling, makes it very easy setting up ambushes and attacks close to the frontline

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Lahatut could be considered by some as underpowered, since it lacks the speed and acceleration of dedicated attack helicopters like the AH-1 Cobra. However it compensates this with it's good handling and agility, since being a smaller object allows the Lahatut to pull insane manoeuvres.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
The Lahatut can be considered anything but survivable, it lacks the armour present in other attack helicopters like the Mi-24D or the AH-1 Cobra. Thus, even with upgrades installed it is vulnerable to HMG and LMG fire from enemy tanks and armoured vehicles.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}The most important upgrades for the Lahatut are the ATGMs and the survivability upgrades, since the Lahatut is small and nimble it sacrifices armour. So investing in protective vests and an improved airframe is a good choice to survive low caliber shots from tanks, since many use 7.62mm or 50.cal to attack helicopters above them.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 14 x Hydra-70 M247 rockets
* 2 x BGM-71C Improved TOW missiles
* 4 x BGM-71C Improved TOW missiles
* 4 x BGM-71D TOW-2 missiles

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
In battles and when dealing with enemy SPAA in the area, the Lahatut should when possible, use the BGM-71D TOW-2 ATGMs. Since the Hydra 70 rockets are too little to be of any particular use and the BGM-71C is worst in almost everything to the TOW-2s.

When facing contested airspace, specially by enemy SPAA, the Lahatut can use it's small size and nimble nature to sneak behind the enemy lines or get close to the point that the enemy SPAA can't properly respond to your attacks. Staying close to the ground, attacking with missiles and retreating to cover is also possible, because the TOW-2 is one of the fastest helicopter based missiles at it's BR, specially when compared to other missiles like the AS.11.

The Lahatut lacks any sort of ballistics computer and it also lacks a gun, thus it is important to stay close to the heliport. Once you are out of rockets or missiles you can't do anything else in the Lahatut, only scout and mark enemy positions in the minimap so that your allies know the enemy positions. But still, staying close to the helipad is important, since being far away may get you vulnerable to SPAA or other helicopters whenever you are retreating to allied positions.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:''' 

* Fast and nimble
* Has two types of ATGMs that are effective against armoured targets
* Customizable loadout

'''Cons:'''

* No machine guns or cannons, useless against enemy aircraft or other helicopters
* The ATGM range is limited to 3,750 m
* Low survivability 

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Lahatut was introduced into the IAF service in 1977 after live fire trials. The helicopter proved very attractive for the IAF, because with it's small size and agility it filled a role that heavier attack helicopters like the Bell AH-1 Cobra couldn't fill. Not only that, the MD-500 only was 1/3 of the price of a Cobra, so it was a cheap way to increase the number of attack helicopters in service with the IAF. A total of 36 units were acquired, 32 after the fire trials in 1977 and 6 more after those 32 were finally delivered in 1984.

The Lahatut has served different roles in the IAF, however most of the time it was equipped with a turret mounted electro-optical sight and four TOW missiles. However this loadout could also be exchanged for 4 x Rocket Pods. The Lahatut was given to the Shooting Lightning squadron and participated in several combat scenarios. The Lahatut participated in raids in Palestinian and Lebanese territory. In the following years the Shooting Lightning squadron and their MD-500 helicopters helped as close air support in the Israeli invasion of the Lebanon. 

When Syrian forces entered the fight in June 9th the Lahatut was the main helicopter used to deal with the Syrian armour in the Beirut-Damascus highway, a very large tank battle. The Lahatut not only was tasked with engaging Syrian armour and providing support to Israeli ground forces however, the Shooting Lightning squadron also used the Lahatut to destroy Syrian SAM arrays in Bekaa valley with a series of sorties flying low, close to the ground to destroy ground based radars that could be a danger for the fighter bombers in the area. A single lahatut was lost due to being discovered by a column of Syrian armour that fired shrapnel shells at the helicopter, causing it to crash. The Lahatut was retired from service by the mid 1990s. This was due to the arrival of more competent and modern helicopters like the AH-64 Apache and more modern Cobras, however it was retained for use in IAF flight schools to train new pilots until being fully retired shortly after.

===[[wt:en/news/7731-development-israeli-helicopters-en|Devblog]]===
In 1975 the Israeli Air Force received its first batch of 6 American Bell AH-1G Cobra strike helicopters, previously used in Vietnam. Israeli pilots enthusiastically began to master a new type of military aircraft and nicknamed the American helicopters ''Tzefa'' - "Palestine viper" - after the largest poisonous snake in the region. A little later, the AH-1G was replaced by the AH-1S equipped with anti-tank missiles, and the Hughes MD500 TOW light helicopters, also equipped with ATGMs to destroy armored vehicles. Israeli attack helicopters received a baptism of fire in 1979 where they were widely used in battle in the First Lebanon War, showing a high combat efficiency. The last helicopters of the AH-1 series were retired from service in 2013.
