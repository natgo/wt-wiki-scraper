== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]].

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
=== Devblog History ===
By the late 1960s, the U.S. Army began drawing up requirements for a new utility helicopter to replace the successful UH-1 Iroquois. Requesting design proposals in 1972, the Army was approached by several manufacturers, including Sikorsky, which put forward their S-70 design. Shortly afterward, Sikorsky received the order to construct several prototypes for comparative testing against the Boeing-Vertol’s rival design. Designated as YUH-60, the Sikorsky’s prototype first took to the skies in October 1974 before three units were delivered to the Army for trials in March 1976.

Being selected as the winning design by the Army later that year, the Sikorsky S-70 was ordered into production under the designation UH-60 and receiving the official nickname “Black Hawk”. After the first units rolled off the assembly line, the Black Hawk entered service with the Army in 1979. After entering service, the Black Hawk received many modifications and upgrades which negatively impacted its performance characteristics. Due to the degrading performance, in 1987 the Army ordered the development of an improved version, the UH-60L. Most notably, this variant introduced more powerful engines and allowed the Black Hawk to carry a substantially higher payload of offensive weapons.
