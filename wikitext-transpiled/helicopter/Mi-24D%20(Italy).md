== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
<blockquote>"Like a bomber with rotor blades".</blockquote> The Mi-24 can take a beating, which allows you to play it in almost every way imaginable. But it is not invulnerable.

As a general rule to increase your survival rate:

Use your high speed, ballistic computer and hard hitting weapons to deliver a swift blow to the enemy. Don't stick around for longer than necessary.

=== Helicopter PVE (AB | Enduring Confrontation) ===
Arguably the early Mi-24's bread and butter as in this mode it can reach its true potential: the big arsenal of rockets and bombs coupled with a ballistic computer will make quick work of frontlines, convoys and even bases. The unguided munitions are more than sufficient to deal with tanks; a well placed S-5K salvo will do the job usually. The lethal S-24 rockets and Falanga ATGMs enable the "Hind" to safely dispose of enemy SPAA at a distance with relative ease without compromising its capabilities against soft targets. That's not to say that the Hind cannot brawl against planes though. the chin-mounted 12.7 mm YaK-B rotary gun is able to shred planes with its high firerate and good muzzle velocity, it also boasts excellent penetration values on top of that and will make swiss cheese out of any light tank or SPAA the Mi-24 might encounter. Couple all this pure firepower with a high top speed and you have a very capable and fun platform for this mode.

Some things to keep in mind are the engagement ranges of major enemy threats such as the [[Falcon|"Falcon"]] (3km), [[ZSU-23-4|"Shilka"]] (2.5km) and [[Gepard|"Gepard"]] (3km) SPAAs. Especially the German Gepard with its long, accurate bursts should always be taken care of first as they can engage and easily kill you up to 3km away. They pose a major threat to you and your team, so it is strongly advised that you use your range advantage (in the form of your 4km ATGM) against them. Alternatively you can lay an ambush behind a hill, near a road you suspect they will pass. climb over it and quickly dispose of them with your gun, S-5K or S-24 rockets. The possibilities are endless, so get creative. Just make sure you expose yourself to the SPAA for as short as possible, as the Hind is not very manoeuvrable and an easy target.

=== Mixed Battles (RB | SB) ===
In both of these modes the player has to pay extra attention, since these are real players this time around. There are a few ways to go about flying the "Krokodil" in mixed battles:

==== Ground Realistic Battles (RB) ====
You have the ability to take the Mi-24D as your first spawn, however, you will not be able to take the ATGMs with you. So if you do decide to take it out early, you will have to get somewhat close, exposing yourself to enemy fire. To combat this, use terrain to mask your approach; here you can make another set of choices:

Fly low, plan your entry and escape routes. Then rush in from your masked approach and rain down accurate S-5K rocket salvos and/or single S-24s. Don't get greedy, strike a target or two and get into cover as quickly as possible. The longer you stay around the enemy, in line of sight, the higher the chance they will target you. Rinse and repeat.

If you don't value your life, or simply like high, risk high reward gameplay, you can scratch the "in and out routes" and rush straight to the battlefield. But be aware that this is more expectable and you'll likely encounter main gun fire from MBTs, something not even the Hind can reliably withstand. This works even better with friends sometimes, so don't hesitate to try it with them.

If you decide to earn some spawn points beforehand and spawn it later in the match, you will be able to take the ATGMs with you. Given that you have enough points of course. At this stage in a match, the likelihood for there to be SPAAs roaming around or sitting in spawn is considerably higher, so it pays off to stay at a distance with the Falangas first. As with the PvE mode, anti air vehicles pose the biggest threat to you, so they should always be a priority target. Be mindful of enemy planes, ramming scout drones and other helicopters as well, they won't hesitate to take a shot at you either.

Enemies are likely to expect you near the helipads, so it is beneficial to move to other areas of the map, not least because your ATGM range wouldn't be sufficient from there anyhow. The Hind is a big helicopter, nevertheless, small forests, buildings and hills will still be enough to conceal you. It is also advisable to change position after killing a ground vehicle or two; the enemy will know your rough location and could spawn SPAAs to try and deal with you. Once there is no major threat around, or when your guided missiles are depleted, a "rush", similar to above can be viable. The alternative is to RTB for more missiles, but that's up to you to decide.

==== Ground Simulator Battles (SB) ====
In general Simulator Battles will play similar to RB, and the same tactics can be applied; only here you can spawn with ATGMs from the start.

Before joining these battles, it is recommended you get used to the simulator controls first via a test drive or custom battle; enable the control dampening (same button as hover mode) to fly instead of "fighting the helicopter" and crashing on takeoff. You can also switch your sight mode to use the ballistic computer for the rockets (multi function menu -> 6 cockpit -> 7 switch sight mode in cockpit).

Expect the enemy to do the same and to even bring some planes. Know what nations are friendly and which are enemy and know what vehicles are to be expected (you can check in the events tab before joining the que). Making sure what you are about to shoot is important, as there are no markers.

Due to your good speed and armour as well as the fact that there will likely always be one or two helicopters spawned at the start, you can attempt hunting them down; the 12.7mm rotary gun is easy to use and will make short work of anything that flies. Outside of these small extras, you can fly it like you would in Ground Realistic Battles.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High top speed
* Extensive payload options
* Ballistic Computer
* Very effective ATGM
* Well armoured against small arms fire
* Rapid-firing rotary gun capable of shredding light armour

'''Cons:'''

* Sluggish manoeuvrability at most speeds
* Big size; easy to detect and hit
* No air-to-air missiles
* Limited ATGM range and firing arcs
* No thermal optics, only early NVG
