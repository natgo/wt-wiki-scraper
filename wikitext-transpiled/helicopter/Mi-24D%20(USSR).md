== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Hind-D) is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5712-shop-pre-order-bundles-and-packs-for-major-update-1-81-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.81 "The Valkyries"]] and was removed from sale after the [[wt:en/news/6542-shop-the-new-year-sale-en|2019 New Year Sale]]. It was made available briefly for purchase with Golden Eagles {{ge}} when the vehicle was reviewed by the [[wt:en/news/8005-wiki-back-on-sale-mi-24d-en|War Thunder Wiki youtube channel]].

One of the most iconic helicopter gunships of the Cold War, the Mil Mi-24 was widely exported throughout the Eastern Bloc as the Soviet Union armed its satellites in Europe and abroad. This Mi-24D is one such example, and flies the colours of the Czechoslovak Air Force. The "Hind" is one of the most heavily armed gunships ever made, possessing extensive payloads and a durable airframe, at the cost of low manoeuvrability. A pair of Klimov TV3-117V turboshaft engines give the helicopter good lifting power and decent flight speeds.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

The Mi-24D, is the equivalent of the ancient Rome's cataphractarii: it's heavily armoured and packs incredible firepower. The Hinds are one of the scariest helicopters in the game, whether in Air or Ground attack, or even in naval.

===Air to Air===

====Mi-24D Vs. Helicopters====
The Mi-24D is able to make quick work of enemy helicopters, with its 12.7 mm YaK-B rotary machine gun. To get the best bullet to knock-out ratio - always aim for the critical elements of the rival.

#Flight deck
#Engine
#Tail

Or if you wish to play with the enemy helicopter, shoot it's wings off with a few well placed shots and it will lose all it's suspended armament. However, doing this will not knock out any machine guns or cannons which it has mounted below on the airframe.
Using the ATGMs to destroy enemy helicopters, the Falanga-PV are one of the fastest missiles in the game - they are able to destroy most helicopters with one hit - however helicopters such as [[Ka-52]], [[Mi-28N]] & [[EC-665_Tiger_HAD|Tiger HAD]] will need to hit the tail, flight deck or engine since they are heavily armoured.

The Mi-24D has 14 Suspended armament presets, from cannons to ATGMs combinations.

The recommended armaments for this role is:

*64 x S-5K rockets + 4 x 9M17M Falanga missiles + 2 x 23 mm GSh-23-2 cannons

The extra cannons installed on the wings, allows the Hind to perform the role of an attack helicopter - these cannons are able to destroy enemy helicopters, within a few clicks of the mouse. However, if this is used in an air-to-ground role these cannons can only penetrate lightly armoured vehicles.

If playing this in an air-to-ground role it's best to go for the

*128 x S-5K rockets + 4 x 9M17M Falanga missiles

====Mi-24D Vs. Fighters====
The Mi-24D does not have any air-to-air missiles, this means engagement with jet fighters will most likely end up with the Hind getting knocked out. However, it is not impossible to shoot them down. To do this, make sure you are equipped with the ATGMs. Wait for the aircraft to approach you head on and fire, keep the ATGM lined up with aircraft and a few seconds later it should hit.

If the aircraft has missiles, nose over the Mi-24D, gain speed, lots of speed - faster you can do this, higher the odds of the jet missing. Drop the Mi-24D to the ground and pull up after the jet has overshot you. If the jet banks and turns around, fire the ATGM and correct the ATGM so it hits the aircraft during this turn.

===Air to Ground===

The best payload for combined battles is

* 128 x S-5K rockets + 4 x 9M17M Falanga missiles

When enemy tankers see the Hind coming towards them, or see it flash up on the hud, they flea for cover. The Mi-24D, provides four ATGM (Falanga-PV) missiles - these are -well aimed - enough to knock out up to four enemy tanks, with a single hit. The range of the Falanga-PV missiles allow for strikes to happen at a distance, which keeps the helicopter out of range from most enemy SPAA or tanks.

====Mi-24D Vs. SPAA====
However the first target if seen, should always be enemy SPAA vehicles. Once the SPAA units have been located and knocked out, it is free hunting. The Mi-24D provides 128 S-5K rockets with its eight Falanga-PV missiles. These 128 rockets provide the capability for at least another two enemy tanks to be knocked out. With a skilled shot, it is EVEN possible that over four or five plus enemy tanks can be destroyed using them, on top of the eight ATGMs.

The Mi-24D is a very large helicopter, it's not a small sleek stealthy helicopter like the [[BO_105_(Family)|BO 105]] It is a big target - In-order to compensate, fly low and fast. Stay above the tree line, under 20 m so any fussed missiles cannot detonate with their proximity fuses. Proximity fuses do not need to directly hit you, for them to knock you out, they only have to explode within the proximity of the helicopter.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Extensive payload options, including lethal S-24 rockets
* Excellent ATGM penetration at 650mm
* Well armoured against small arms fire
* Quick-firing machine gun capable of shredding very light armour
* Premium vehicle reward bonuses for RP and SL

'''Cons:'''

* No air-to-air missiles
* Limited ATGM firing arcs at close ranges
* Very visible, with large radar cross section
* Sluggish to manoeuvre at most speeds
* No thermal optics, only early NVG

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Work started in 1971 on improving the layout of the [[Mi-24A|Mi-24A/B]] helicopter in Soviet service. Complaints stemmed from the cockpit design, which was regarded as obstructive to the pilot and the weapon system operator's (WSO) view and also having insufficient level of protection for the crew.<ref name="Gordon_2001">Gordon 2001, 21-24</ref> Two early-production Mi-24A models were converted into the new design in 1972, which became distinguishable by their starboard-side tail rotor.<ref name="Mladenov_2010">Mladenov 2010, Mi-24D</ref> The redesigned helicopter saw the cockpit arrangement transformed into a stepped tandem cockpit, which saw the WSO placed in front, slightly lower, of the pilot. The new arrangement allowed for better, unobstructed view for both pilot and WSO, while having a better armour envelope around the crew. The new layout also allowed the additions of {{annotation|LLLTV|Low-Light Level Television}} and {{annotation|FLIR|Forward-Looking InfraRed}} sensors on the helicopter, which saw the nose gear lengthened to allow enough ground clearance for the additions.<ref name="Gordon_2001" />

The new Mi-24 variant with the stepped tandem cockpit was intended to receive the [[Mi-24V]] ("V" being the third letter in the Cyrillic alphabet). However, the intended [[9M114 Shturm|Shturm-V]] missile was not available for the new helicopter.<ref name="Gordon_2001" /> In an interim solution, the helicopter would retain the weapon systems found on the Mi-24B (which consisted of a USPU-24 turret with YakB-12.7 machine guns and the capability of being equipped with 9M17M Falanga ATGMs<ref name="Mladenov_2010 (1)">Mladenov 2010, Mi-24A/B</ref>). This interim helicopter design would be known as the '''Mi-24D''', or by the designation ''Izdeliye 246''. The Mi-24D would begin production in 1973 at the Arsenyev plant and Aviation Plant No.168. After performing in state tests in 1974, the Mi-24D would be put into the Soviet Air Force service in March 29, 1976. The helicopter would serve not only with the Soviet Union, but for its export clients as well.<ref name="Mladenov_2010" />

A trainer version of the Mi-24D, the Mi-24DU ''Izdeliye 249'' was also produced that had the WSO position adapted to hold an instructor pilot instead.<ref name="Mladenov_2010" /> Both the Mi-24D and Mi-24DU production at the two factories for both Soviet and export clients account for at least 625 units.<ref name="Gordon_2001" />

=== Service in other nations ===

==== Czechoslovakia ====
The Czechoslovakian Army received 28 Mi-24Ds, delivered between August 1978, and by 1982. Between 1985 and 1989 two training Mi-24DUs were purchased (as well as 31 units of the modernized Mi-24V). Upon the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993 the inventory of Mi-24s were split, with the now Czech Republic Army receiving 16 Mi-24D and one Mi-24DU (also 20 Mi-24V). In 2003, all the Mi-24D helicopters were retired. <ref>Soušek n.d.</ref>

To replace the old Mi-24Ds, the Czech government purchased US-made AH-1Zs. Some of the inventory Mi-24Ds were donated to Ukraine.<ref name="NDOS_2020">Mladenov 2020</ref>

==== Bulgaria ====
The Bulgarian Air Force have a fleet of 38 Mi-24Ds originally delivered between 1979-1985, during 1999 the Mi-24Ds in service were reduced. The type has suffered from a significant lack of serviceability due to the limited supply of otherwise vital and expensive spare parts, such as rotor blades, as well as expired engine and airframe time between overhauls.

Bulgarian Mi-24D sold to other countries/companies:

* Between 2002–2004 dozens of Mi-24Ds were sold to local arms trade companies.
* 6 were delivered to the US and 2 went to the Ivory Coast in 2003.
* 6 Mi-24Ds followed suite to Mali between 2007-2010 after having completed overhaul.
* 5 Mi-24Ds were sold out by the Bulgarian MoD to Metalika-AV in December 2011, and by late 2017 at least 4 of these had been returned to airworthy condition.
* In 2017–2018 three were sold out to the Ivory Coast and one went to Burkina Faso in 2018, followed by another helicopter in 2019.

In 2004, the Bulgarian MoD moved forward with a tender covering the comprehensive upgrade and life extension of 6 Mi-24Ds – all of these helicopters were delivered in 1985 and 1986.<ref name="NDOS_2020" />

==== Hungary ====
The Hungarian Air Force have a fleet of 30 Mi-24Ds received by the former Soviet Union between 1978-1985.<ref name="NDOS_2020" />
