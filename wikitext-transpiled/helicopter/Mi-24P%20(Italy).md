== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Hind-F) is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]].

The Mi-24P is very similar to the [[Mi-24V (Italy)|Mi-24V]], having the same airframe, technology, and weapons. The only difference is the gun armament: the chin-mounted Yak-B gatling gun has been replaced with a fixed GSh-30-2 cannon mounted on the right side of the nose. This is the same type of cannon mounted on the [[Su-25]] attack jet, another Soviet "flying tank". Although it is difficult to aim, a quick burst from the cannon can shred lightly armoured vehicles. Thus, the Mi-24P is a sidegrade to the Mi-24V, having more anti-ground ability at the cost of a minor amount of anti-air capability.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
The Mi-24P Hind is protected by 4 mm steel plates near the cockpit area, and the engine area, giving it decent protection against small MG fire, and shrapnel. The cockpit is protected by 60 mm of bulletproof glass, though it's only on the front and the pilot can be knocked out easily with a spray of MG fire. Same can be applied to the gunner too. It can survive direct shots, especially if the enemy hits the crew compartment due to the empty space of that area, though there is fuel underneath the crew compartment and can be set on fire if it is hit. HE/HE-VT, ATGMs, SAMS and AAMs are usually detrimental to the Hind and can bring it down easily, though MANPADs such as Stingers and Iglas can be tanked as they have lower explosive power, but they can render the Hind critically damaged/disabled and needing to return to base.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between four presets:
** 1 x 30 mm GSh-30-2K cannon (250 rpg) + 192 x countermeasures
** 1 x 30 mm GSh-30-2K cannon + 192 x countermeasures + HIRSS
** 1 x 30 mm GSh-30-2K cannon + 192 x countermeasures + HIRSS + IRCM

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Mi-24P can be used very similarly to the Mi-24V and will function identically in standoff situations where the 9M114 Shturm ATGMs or S-24 rockets would be used from afar. The powerful cannon is helpful when making aggressive attack runs, either as a first choice or when moving closer to the battlefield after expending ATGMs. Even with ballistic computer assistance, it may take some practice to use the cannon effectively. Line up the Mi-24P for a gun run in advance and start firing from some distance away to avoid needing heavy course corrections.

The R-60/R-60M missiles are somewhat more important for the Mi-24P than they are on the Mi-24V. The cannon is likely to evaporate any aircraft it touches, but an agile opponent can dodge its fire. It is difficult to hit jets with it unless they linger in a head-on. Even in helicopter dogfights, the contemporary [[AH-1F]] for example has superior agility and a turreted 20 mm Gatling cannon that can perforate the Mi-24P in turn, so having a couple of missiles on hand to dispatch aircraft with a couple of button presses is more helpful than ever.

Keep in mind that the kind of light vehicles that the Mi-24P's cannon is most effective on are often quite good at fighting helicopters in their own right. For SPAA vehicles their effectiveness against nearby air targets is a given, but IFVs with optical tracking, proximity fused/airburst rounds, and/or proximity-fused ATGMs can also send the Mi-24P back to the hangar without much trouble. The Hind family may have a reputation as "flying tanks", but they may more accurately be considered "flying IFVs" given their troop transport capability and limited protection. Thus, in War Thunder the Mi-24P can borrow the IFV tactic of using its great speed to zip in and out of the battlefield and attack from unexpected directions.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 30 mm cannon provides great offensive/defensive capabilities against lightly armoured vehicles and air targets
* Very flexible payload
* R60M missile is very effective against close flying targets
* 9M114 Shturm ATGM can be fired from 5 km away, making most AA useless
* Has access to RWR, HIRSS, IRCM, flares/chaff and a ballistic computer
* Can easily reach 300 km/h with a full payload
* Armoured plates increase protection for the engine, transmission and the crew

'''Cons:'''

* Large profile and lack of manoeuvrability makes it an easy target
* Fixed 30 mm cannon may be hard to aim at air targets for inexperienced players
* Lacks thermal and night vision sight for gunner
