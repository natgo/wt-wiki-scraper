== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Hind-E) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 "The Valkyries"]].

The Mi-24V has been highly modernized compared to the preceding Hind-A. It has the signature tandem bubble canopies introduced from the [[Mi-24D (USSR)|Hind-D]] onward for a sleeker appearance and better visibility, although the flight model remains essentially the same. Firepower has been greatly improved: on top of the internal 12.7 mm gatling gun mounted in a chin turret, the Mi-24V can carry various combinations of S-8KO HEAT rockets, S-24 heavy HE rockets, 9M114 Shturm ATGMs, unguided bombs, gun pods, and even R-60M air-to-air missiles. Survivability is bolstered by exhaust suppression, IRCM, and countermeasure systems. The Mi-24V is one of the most feature-packed helicopters at its battle rating and can be a major threat to ground and air targets alike.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Mi-24V flies very similarly to the Mi-24A. It is very fast in a straight line and has a good climb rate courtesy of its powerful engines, but its size and weight make it hard to turn and manoeuvre.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|YaK-B (12.7 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between three presets:
** 1 x 12.7 mm YaK-B machine gun (1,470 rpg)
** 1 x 12.7 mm YaK-B machine gun (1,470 rpg) + HIRSS
** 1 x 12.7 mm YaK-B machine gun (1,470 rpg) + HIRSS + 192 x countermeasures
** 1 x 12.7 mm YaK-B machine gun (1,470 rpg) + HIRSS + 192 x countermeasures + IRCM

The YaK-B gatling gun is a straight upgrade to the A-12.7 machine gun used by the Mi-24A. It fires the same rounds but has a blazing fast firing rate of 4,500 rounds/min (75 rounds/sec, higher than the [[AH-1G]]'s M134 Minigun), more ammunition, and wider firing angles. The penetration remains insufficient to damage most ground vehicles other than those with extremely thin armour, but it does good work against other helicopters and nearby aircraft.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|9M114 Shturm|R-60|R-60M|S-8KO|S-24}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance presets:

* Without load
* 2 x R-60 missiles
* 4 x R-60 missiles
* 2 x R-60M missiles
* 4 x R-60M missiles
* 80 x S-8KO rockets
* 4 x S-24 rockets
* 4 x 9M114 Shturm missiles
* 8 x 9M114 Shturm missiles
* 4 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (1,000 kg total)
* 2 x 500 kg FAB-500M-54 bombs (1,000 kg total)
* 4 x 23 mm GSh-23L cannons (250 rpg = 1,000 total)

The Mi-24V has a huge arsenal and plenty of hardpoints to support it. The main anti-tank weapon is the 9M114 Shturm ATGM designed specifically for the Hind family. Compared to the Mi-24A's 9M17M Falanga ATGMs, the Shturm has slightly lower penetration in exchange for an extended range of 5 km and more than double the flight speed (550 m/s compared to 230 m/s). In fact, the Shturm is one of the fastest ATGMs in the game, which makes it both easy to aim and effective at dealing with SPAAs. The penetration is underwhelming however, and tanks with ERA and/or composite armour can shrug it off. Up to 8 can be carried in total, and 4 can be carried on the outermost pylons without conflicting with other stores.

Many unguided ground attack weapons are available. The Mi-24A's 57 mm S-5K rockets have been replaced with two new options: S-8KO HEAT rockets that have far better penetration and still come in good quantities, and S-24 HE rockets that are carried singly but pack immense amounts of explosives. With ballistic computer assistance, the S-24s actually be used effective from several kilometres away, especially against lightly-armoured vehicles. 250 kg and 500 kg bombs are also available for players who enjoy the novelty of helicopter bombing, now assisted with CCIP from the ballistic computer, but be sure to set an appropriate fuse delay. Finally, 23 mm GSh-23L gun pods are available, but their utility is limited because they do not have significantly higher penetration than the internal gun.

The last options for the Mi-24V are R-60 and R-60M air-to-air missiles. Soviet jet pilots may find these familiar: they are lightweight and highly manoeuvrable missiles with low flare resistance. The R-60M is all-aspect and should be used instead of the base R-60 once unlocked. "Aphids" are highly useful for dealing with enemy jets and other helicopters, allowing the Mi-24 to fulfill some SPAA or air superiority duties, but they are not quite on the level of the [[TY-90]] available to Chinese helicopters and can be easily flared by attentive enemies.

== Usage in battles ==
<!--''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->

The Mi-24V has many tools to play with on the battlefield. Like its predecessor, it can be a fun option for rushing with unguided weapons given its high speed, large ordnance capacity, and robust airframe: zooming in at tree-top level to send out volleys of S-8s, lob S-24s, or drop 500 kg presents can certainly put the enemy team off balance if they are not expecting helicopters. However the Mi-24's large size and poor agility makes it dangerous to stay near the battlefield once detected, and this playstyle does not make good use of its advanced capabilities. As a second spawn, the Mi-24V can become a very dangerous opponent: a multi-role loadout of 9M114 Shturm ATGMs, R-60M AAMs, and unguided rockets is perfect for destroying ground vehicles and contesting airspace at the same time while not putting the Hind at much risk.

The Shturms outrange and definitely outspeed all other contemporary ATGMs like the TOW-2 and HOT-2. The Mi-24V can stay up to 5 km back from the battlefield and engage targets in relative safety. HIRSS, IRCM, and countermeasures prevent enemy MANPADS from easily locking the Hind, try to spot and destroy them before venturing closer to the battlefield. Keep in mind that the Shturms are rather weak however, having both low raw penetration and no tandem warhead. Tanks with composite or reactive armour can often shrug them off from the front and the Mi-24V's 10x maximum optical zoom does not offer enough precision to target weak points outside of a few kilometres. If it is not possible or easy to destroy a target from the front, try attacking from the side or switching to other weapons.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Very strong helicopter, can survive multiple hits
* One of the fastest helicopters in the game
** The Yak-B machine gun fed with 1470 rounds is effective against enemy aircraft and lightly armoured targets
* Large payload options:
** Can be equipped with IRCM, 192 countermeasures, and HIRSS
** Can carry 4 R-60M AAM with 30G of overload which is really effective to deal with jet fighters
** Can carry 4 S-24 rockets
** Can carry up to 8 Shturm ATGMs, good range and great flight speed

'''Cons:'''

* Big helicopter meaning it's a big target
* Heavy helicopter, bad manoeuvrability
* R-60 aren't fitted with ECCM so they might be deflected by flares
* Yak-B is ineffective against heavily armoured targets
* Doesn't have access to thermal vision
* Shturm ATGMs are somewhat weak, insufficient against tanks with composite or reactive armour

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Work on the Mi-24 began in the early 1960s, with engineers at the Mil design bureau coming to the realisation that helicopters capable of both transporting troops and materiel as well as being able to provide fire support are gaining ever-increasing importance with new combat doctrines focusing on battlefield mobility. The Mi-24V is a further development of the Mi-24, that entered production in 1976. The V modification most notably introduced the 9M114 "Shturm" guided missiles to the Hind's arsenal, which in turn significantly increased its hit probabilities and destructive power. In its decade-long production (1976 - 1984), around 1,000 Mi-24Vs were produced, eventually becoming the most produced version of the Hind.
