== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' (NATO Code: Hind-E) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 "The Valkyries"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}

<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|YaK-B (12.7 mm)}}

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

- Very strong helicopter, can survive multiple hits
- One of the fastest helicopters in the game
  \*\* The Yak-B machine gun fed with 1470 rounds is effective against enemy aircraft and lightly armoured targets
- Large payload options:
  ** Can be equipped with IRCM, 192 countermeasures, and HIRSS
  ** Can carry 4 R-60M AAM with 30G of overload which is really effective to deal with jet fighters
  ** Can carry 4 S-24 rockets
  ** Can carry up to 8 Shturm AGMs

'''Cons:'''

- Big helicopter meaning it's a big target
- Heavy helicopter, bad manoeuvrability
- R-60 aren't fitted with ECCM so they might be deflected by flares
- Yak-B is ineffective against heavily armoured targets
- Doesn't have access to thermal vision
- Shturm AGMs are not laser-guided

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

Work on the Mi-24 began in the early 1960s, with engineers at the Mil design bureau coming to the realisation that helicopters capable of both transporting troops and materiel as well as being able to provide fire support are gaining ever-increasing importance with new combat doctrines focusing on battlefield mobility. The Mi-24V is a further development of the Mi-24, that entered production in 1976. The V modification most notably introduced the 9M114 "Shturm" guided missiles to the Hind's arsenal, which in turn significantly increased its hit probabilities and destructive power. In its decade-long production (1976 - 1984), around 1,000 Mi-24Vs were produced, eventually becoming the most produced version of the Hind.
