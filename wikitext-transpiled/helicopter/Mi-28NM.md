== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Ground Breaking"]]. Also known as 'Havoc', it is the successor of the legendary [[Mi-24 (Family)|Mi-24 Hind]] in the gunship role, featuring much better combat systems for the task. It is an upgrade of the previous [[Mi-28N]] with better weapon systems, enhanced NVD and a surface-search radar.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Mi-28NM is not so different when it comes to flight performance compared to his predecessors. It can reach high speeds with ease but severely lacks manoeuvrability and agility compared to its counterparts, particularly the EC-665 Tiger family. While it is able to quickly reach fast speeds, the Mi-28 also takes time to slow down, forcing pilots to estimate the braking distance to avoid enemy fire or crashing.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
The Mi-28NM has an armoured cabin that protects all flanks of both the pilot and the gunner from small arms fire and fragmentation. It is one of the strongest armoured helicopter cabins in the game, making it able to withstand multiple hits from small machine guns. However, armour is inefficient when facing heavy calibre anti-air such as 12.7 mm machine gun fire and higher calibre autocannons; missiles are not excluded. The Mi-28NM also has access to a high quantity of countermeasures, nothing new in Russian helicopters. It has access to 128 countermeasures that are coupled to the Missile Alert Warning system. They are particularly useful when facing IR guided missiles from various threats. Carrying chaff in these pods can also be useful, although its effectiveness may be limited due to the resistance of radars to interference at this rank. However, it is also able to be used when facing SARH and ARH missiles such as the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-54 Phoenix. As with all helicopters, the best armour is to remain hidden and at stand-off distance, using buildings or environmental cover to protect you from radars, IRST and visual contact which will then escalate to engagement.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

It is recommended that the ATGMs are prioritized, followed by NVD and finally countermeasures. The initial Ataka missiles are useful as starter missiles but later missiles should be prioritized, especially the Vikhr ATGM. As one continues to research, protection modules are advised such as flak jacket. Flight performance modules are suggested but not a 'must have'.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|2A42 (30 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between two presets:
** 1 x 30 mm 2A42 cannon, chin turret (250 rpg)
** 1 x 30 mm 2A42 cannon + 128 x countermeasures

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|FAB-250M-62 (250 kg)|FAB-500M-62 (500 kg)|S-8KO|S-13OF|GSh-23L (23 mm)}}
{{main|9K127 Vikhr|9M39 Igla|9M120-1 Ataka|9M123 Khrizantema}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance presets:

* Without load
* 8 x 9M39 Igla missiles
* 80 x S-8KO rockets
* 20 x S-13OF rockets
* 4 x 9M120-1 Ataka missiles
* 8 x 9M123 Khrizantema missiles
* 8 x 9M120-1 Ataka missiles
* 16 x 9M120-1 Ataka missiles
* 12 x 9K127 Vikhr missiles
* 4 x 250 kg FAB-250M-62 bombs (1,000 kg total)
* 4 x 500 kg FAB-500M-62 bombs (2,000 kg total)
* 2 x 23 mm GSh-23L cannons (250 rpg = 500 total)

The Mi-28NM has a wide selection of weaponry for a range of roles, from small-game hunting to the most armoured targets. While Vikhrs may seem the most obvious decision of missile to carry, the Ataka and Khrizantema missiles can also be useful in certain situations. Khrizantema holds the highest penetration and the highest explosive payload at the same range of the Ataka (but almost half of the range of the Vikhr), at the cost of a reduced numbers able to be carried. Vikhr holds the highest speed and range with a bigger explosive payload than Ataka but smaller than Khrizantema, it also has a proximity fuze. Depending on the needs, the missiles to be carried are set to user's discretion.

The Mi-28NM also has access to Igla missiles, carrying the highest amount of anti-air missiles in-game (up to 8), making the Mi-28N a formidable anti-air platform. It should be noted that the Vikhr can also be used for the anti-air role, but require the constant attention of the user instead of being fire-and-forget like the Igla.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Mi-28NM is a gunship and should be used as such. It holds a very capable array of weapons for all scenarios: from column destroying to anti-ship duties. The primary role of the Mi-28NM is Close Air Support, making it a very capable platform for assisting ground allies against other ground assets with rockets and missiles. However, it can be used primarily in three ways:

* Anti-tank role: due to the significant amount of ATGMs it can carry, the Mi-28NM is more than suited for tank busting at all ranges in all weathers. Trees, buildings, and other environmental cover should be used to ensure the survivability of the Havoc as it will protect it from detection and, in case of being spotted and engaged, a route of escape as well as solid cover against enemy missiles and anti-air cannons.
* Rocket launcher: the immense quantities of rockets it can carry make it a flying MLRS, able to strafe all sorts of ground targets with the vast selection of rockets. S-8KO rockets prove to be the best for taking out both armoured targets and lightly armoured but scattered targets, as the penetration and quantities of the rockets ensure you are able to cover a wider area with salvos. The S-13OF rockets are more of a heavy duty rocket where a lot of explosive power needs to be centralized in a single place, for example when taking down enemy bases and control points in Helicopter Enduring Confrontation mode.
* Anti-air: not only do the Vikhrs prove themselves to be a formidable anti-air weapon, but the vast amount of Iglas show that the Mi-28NM is very much capable of taking care of the airspace, as it can take a maximum of 8 targets almost simultaneously. The best way to approach this role is to stay behind cover, out of sight and engage only when an enemy aircraft is spotted, being helicopter or jet. One of the main disadvantages of facing helicopters with the Igla is that most will have MAW at top tier, which will automatically pop flares and confuse the Igla; for this reason, unsuspecting opponents should be targeted, and if possible, be strafed with the autocannon.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* High max speed and decent vertical climb rate when loaded (10m/s) 
* Arsenal of versatile weaponries against both ground and air targets
* Has access to 3rd gen gunner thermals and N-025 search radar
* Has access to Missile Approach Warning (MAW) systems
* 2A42 30mm autocannon with APDS rounds that can penetrate MBTs.
* Strong cockpit armor that can withstand 12.7mm AP rounds
* Best IRCM system in game making it almost immune to all IR missiles
* N-025 K-band radar does not trigger RWR, with MTI scan mode capable of identifying both air and ground targets 

'''Cons:'''

* Sluggish airframe and irresponsive pitch
* Tendency to roll right due to imbalanced lift in rotor during high-speed turns (300km/h+)
* N-025 radar lacks the 360° scan mode like the AN/APG-78 on the Apaches
* limited gunner pitch view angles compared to another helis with turrets
* Autocannon dispersion is quite large at 1km+ range
