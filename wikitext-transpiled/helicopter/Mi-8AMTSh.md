== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Mi-8AMTSh''' (''Armeyskiy Mnogotselevoy Transportno-Shturmovoy''; "army multi-purpose transport and assault") is a modernisation of the Soviet Mi-8 transport helicopter, developed on the basis of the Mi-8AMT at the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant in 1996. The helicopter was given the ability to carry similar guided weapon systems to modern versions of the [[Mi-24 (Family)|Mi-24]], including the 9M114 Shturm ATGM. The helicopter also received enhanced armour protection, new avionics, and a modified design. The Mi-8AMTSh was adopted by the Russian Air Force in 2009.

Introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]], the Mi-8AMTSh is distinguished from the [[Mi-8TV|previous version]] by a new set of weapons, in particular new 9M114 Sturm ATGMs with longer range than the 9M17M Falanga, 9M39 Igla air-to-air missiles for protection against enemy aircraft, new gun pods, and countermeasures for protection against IR-guided missiles. However, the main disadvantages of the airframe remain, in particular the huge size and heavy weight do not allow the helicopter to actively manoeuvre between trees or terrain, so it will be difficult for it to evade enemy missiles.

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|PKT (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 7.62 mm PKT machine gun, nose turret (1,750 rpg)
* 128 x countermeasures

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

{{Navigation-Start|Default weapon presets}}
{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}

* 2 x 12.7 mm YaK-B machine guns (750 rpg = 1,500 total) + 4 x 7.62 mm GShG-7.62 machine guns (1,800 rpg = 7,200 total)
* 6 x 23 mm GSh-23L cannons (250 rpg = 1,500 total)
* 4 x 9M39 Igla missiles

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
With the Mi-8AMTSh recieving better long ranged armament, countermeasures, and a ballistics computer, along with an engine upgrade, the Mi-8AMTSh is a good support helicopter to go along in your lineup.

In Ground RB, the Mi-8AMTSh is effective for both stand off engagements and rushing into the battle first spawn. The Mi-8AMTSh can carry up to 120x S-8K rockets, which are effective with dealing any armored targets when launching them in salvos, along with the added ballistics computer, hitting accurate shots from distances is easier to do with rockets. The uprated engines also allow it to pick up speeds quicker and is less prone to stalling its engines. The Mi-8 is a big helicopter overall, with the design originally being a transport helicopter. Mobility will still be mediocre and multiple machine gun and autocannon fire will easily defeat the Mi-8, along with being prone to pilot snipes.

For standoff engagements, the outermost pylons can take up to 4x 9M114 Shturm ATGMs on each pylon, for a total of 8x ATGMs which are good for dealing damage against ground targets overall from a distance. Prioritize SPAAs and Anti Air that are trying to target you. For defending against air targets, you can equip up to 4x 9M39 Igla missiles on the middle pylons, for a total up to 8x Igla missiles. These missiles are very flare resistant, but are more suited to deal with helicopters, though they can still take down air targets, despite its manueverability being subpar. The best way to use them is to catch the enemy off guard in their attack run or in their low energy state at a medium range distance. If the aircraft does spot you, try to use the Iglas to ward them off and deter them from attacking you, or for you to get a better launch angle. It is ideal to bring a GUV-8700 gunpod or GSh-23L to deal with air targets overall, as the single PKT is not ideal for engaging jets.

The Mi-8AMTSh does lack HIRSS, RWR and IRCM Dazzler than its Mi-24 cousins so be on the look out for any anti aircraft vehicles that are trying to target you. Without HIRSS, heat seeking missiles will have an easier time locking you on, along with radar missile systems not giving a lock warning due to the lack of RWR. It is best to preflare when dealing with heat seaking anti-air over the battlefield

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->'''Pros:'''

* Better, powerful uprated engines over the previous variant. Higher top speed
* Access to 128x countermeasures
* Improved, versatile armament than its predecessor
* Access to ballistics computer
* Access up to 8x 9114M Shturm missiles that can be fired up to 5 km away
* Access up to 8x 9M39 Igla missiles, good for dealing against helicopters and slow aircrafts
* GUV-8700 and GSh-23L gunpod offer extra firepower.

'''Cons:'''

* Lacks RWR, HIRSS and IRCM Dazzler unlike its Mi-24 cousins
* Downgraded to 7.62mm PKT for machine gun. Subpar for dealing with targets overall
* Big recognizable profile
* Sluggish mobility when manuevering
* Crew closely grouped together
* ATGM firing angle is slightly akward. Have to pitch nose down slightly if in a hover to launch
* Lacks Thermals and NVD for the gunner
