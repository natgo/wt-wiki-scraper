== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
This combat ready version of the Mi-8 was developed based on the Mi-8T model in 1974. The "TV" designation stands for "Transportno-Vooruzhenny," literally meaning "Transport-Armed." The helicopter was equipped with a movable 12.7mm machine gun in the nose, along with six pylons designed to carry a wide variety of suspended weaponry, including the Falanga anti-tank guided missile. This armament package brought the helicopter’s combat ability roughly in line with early versions of the Mi-24. Despite being modified for combat, the helicopter retained its full troop transport functionality, being able to carry up to 23 soldiers, who could also fire their personal weapons through loopholes installed in the windows. The Mi-8TV helicopters were produced in limited numbers in Kazan. They were used for various roles in tandem with the Mi-24 and were also supplied to border patrol and naval aviation units.

The German Mi-8TB is an export version capable of carrying up to 6 "Malyutka" ATGMs.
