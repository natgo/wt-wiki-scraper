== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''', known as OH-58D戰搜直升機 (lit: combat reconnaissance helicopter) represents the 39 helicopters purchased and used by the ROCA Aviation and Special Force Command (陸軍航空特戰指揮部). The OH-58 Kiowa originally started as the Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) program to upgrade US Army observation helicopters which Bell Helicopters won the contract for in 1981; this project eventually developed into the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP) and the new OH-58D joined US Army in 1985. The ROCA then purchased 39 helicopters in 1992 (26 purchased alongside the fleet of AH-1W) and 1999 (13 helicopters), and deployed them at the only two helicopter companies in the ROCA and Army Aviation Training Command. Although 2 helicopters have crashed during its service since 1992 (2000 and 2020), the ROCA will still likely use OH-58D for the time being thanks to sufficient spare parts for up to 12 years bought from US.

Introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]] and marking the arrival of ROCA helicopters, the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior performs identically with its US cousin. Not only does it have a mast-mounted camera to make good use of terrain or tree tops to conceal itself, the four AGM-114K or AIM-92 will make sure enemy vehicles will have to think twice before hunting the OH-58D down.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The OH-58D is a reasonably nimble machine, fully researched it will be able to fly at a reasonable straight-line speed of up to 220 km/h in neutral flight and climb up to 7 m/s. While this is completely sufficient for use without notable shortcomings, it pales in comparison to the opposition at its BR, both within its own tech tree and outside. Though in turn this means when freshly bought, players may find its performance lacking.

One point of note is the Kiowa Warrior's ability fly evasive or performative manoeuvres. While it can make some impressive turns and even fly upside down, its flight model fails to compare against what players might have become used to on the first Z-9 model or any of its successors. All in all the OH-58D is a very average machine in terms of flight performance, by no means bad, but also nothing outstanding.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
Due to its nature of being an observation helicopter, there are very little need for extra protection other than the flak jacket for the pilots; this also means flying into the main combat area equals to kamikaze and should only be considered in dire situation.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between three presets:
** 36 x countermeasures
** 36 x countermeasures + Flak jackets
** 36 x countermeasures + Flak jackets + IRCM

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

{{Navigation-Start|Default weapon presets}}
{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}

* 1 x 12.7 mm GAU-19 machine gun (550 rpg)
* 4 x ATAS (AIM-92) missiles
* 2 x AGM-114K Hellfire II missiles
* 4 x AGM-114K Hellfire II missiles
* 14 x APKWS II (M151) missiles
* 14 x APKWS II (M282) missiles
* 14 x Hydra-70 M247 rockets
{{Navigation-End}}

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Small profile and agile, good for switching locations to hit enemies
* Mast mount cameras for minimal visibility to enemies
* Access to AIM-92 for self-defense against aircraft
* Powerful AGM-114K with good range
* Laser-guided rockets for precise hit on enemies

'''Cons:'''

* No extra protection
* Slower than PLAGF Aviation Corps counterparts
* Relatively low payload weight

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
