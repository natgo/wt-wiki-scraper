== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update "Sons of Attila"]].

A single-engined helicopter originally used for reconnaissance purposes, now armed with offensive equipment. The OH-58 was originally developed during the 1960s as a military use version of the Bell 206A "Jet Ranger", where it was entered for submission for the Light Observation Helicopter Program against contemporaries like the OH-6 "Cayuse". The decision fell to the latter. Bell decided to pick up the pieces and resubmit the OH-58A for when the competition reopened a few years later.

In the 1980s, the OH-58D (among other variants) eventually became the bid to replace the AH-1 "Cobra" in the reconnaissance role for the air cavalry and light attack companies as part of the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP). The D-variant was what introduced the characteristic mast-mounted sight (MMS). It houses most of the helicopter's thermal imaging and targeting systems. The Kiowa Warrior sub-variant was what brought weapon pylons and engine improvements to the table.

The OH-58D Kiowa Warrior saw a number of modern conflicts and further modernisation programs all the way until the 2010s. Whilst the US has started phasing out the OH-58F Block II, it is still in use with a number of smaller militaries like Austria, Croatia, Greece, and Taiwan. The OH-58CS "Combat Scout" is a mast-less version of the aircraft and also sees use with countries like Saudi Arabia.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The OH-58D is quite nimble, whilst certainly not amongst the most agile flight models in the game it can reach comfortable speeds in quick time. Players who experienced the AH-6M previously to this may initially be put off. Aggressive manoeuvres are possible, but not recommended. Overhead flight will see the helicopter lose a fair amount of altitude and may unintentionally lead to a rather unwanted confrontation with the ground, though these types of manoeuvres are absolutely possible if you are far enough above ground.

Side-to-side movement is recommended for evasive actions, as "pulling up" will see the helicopter decelerate about halfway up. Just like in the real world, the helicopter is built for nap-of-the-earth flight, so staying low is sensible. Forward flight will see you in the mid-range of helicopter speed, you won't reach the speeds of heavier machines with bigger blades and more powerful engines. That said, it's heavier than its predecessor and thus climbs a fair bit slower.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
The main frame of the helicopter is completely unarmoured. The defensive capabilities of this machine are mostly limited to the pilot's ability to stay hidden. You have two crew members, who are both capable of manning controls. This does help, should a machine gun round find its way into the cockpit canopy.

More consistent defensive options include the OEAPS mounted on the rear behind the rotor, which can stop some IR-missiles from locking as well as optical locking if the Pod is visible. You also have a flare pod mounted on the bottom of the craft. It is recommended that should you flare missiles, you either point this pod at the missile whilst flaring/moving or pre-flare using your up to 36 countermeasures. Due to shooting downwards, terrain may obscure the flares from ground fired ordnance.

The helicopter also has a fairly large full tank behind the crew, which may absorb fragments from machine gun rounds and maybe even cannon ammo. However, this is your only fuel tank and if it were to burn out the engine will be out of fuel. Helicopters with skid landing gear, such as this one, tend to have it absorb a shot or two if they're lucky.

It is advised to not rely on luck and stay out of easy to spot positions.

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between three presets:
** 36 x countermeasures
** 36 x countermeasures + Flak jackets
** 36 x countermeasures + Flak jackets + IRCM

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

{{Navigation-Start|Default weapon presets}}
{{Navigation-First-Simple-Line}}

* 1 x 7.62 mm M134 Minigun machine gun (1,500 rpg)
* 1 x 12.7 mm GAU-19 machine gun (550 rpg)
* 1 x 30 mm LR30 cannon (250 rpg)
* 4 x ATAS (AIM-92) missiles
* 2 x AGM-114K Hellfire II missiles
* 4 x AGM-114K Hellfire II missiles
* 14 x APKWS II (M151) missiles
* 14 x APKWS II (M282) missiles
* 14 x Hydra-70 M247 rockets
{{Navigation-End}}

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
Pilots familiar with the AH-6M will find themselves in a similar position. The OH-58D sets out to mostly achieve the same end results with improved ease of use. You have the same high-resolution thermals with improved 36.8x magnification optics. The mast-mount also provides a higher point of view, however currently going hull-down whilst designating targets is not possible. The laser still originates from the pilot/cockpit and thus a missile will miss unless that is exposed. You can still peek ridges using it though.

Your most commonly used weaponry will be the AGM-114K Hellfire II, which you get two of starting out stock. It requires you to lase the target for the terminal part of flight, which tends to be around the final 8 seconds of flight. They can be sent into a target area and guide themselves initially using their in-ordnance guidance (IOG). Make sure to turn off your laser temporarily should you drop behind cover as the missile will nosedive otherwise.

Your other options, also usually known as your other weapon pylon when stock, include the APKWS II M282 and M151. The latter only functions against open-top vehicles as they are purely HE. The former feature a SAP warhead, which may deceive you into thinking it being a poor choice with a meagre ~500g of explosive mass. It will make short work of light vehicles though, easily penetrating vehicles like the Strela-M2 and the 2S38 and exploding within the crew compartment. Laser homing missiles like these should be fired from 3-4 km range, whilst pointing the helicopter at the target as they are quite rigid at turning.

The Kiowa Warrior will eventually be able to equip ATAS, which are the Stinger missiles that may be familiar from other vehicles already. They can be deadly from the rear aspect against less manoeuvrable planes, side-aspect shots aren't recommended as they need to make contact to detonate. They can be a viable secondary option besides AGM-114K.

The not-so popular options include small M247 Hydra rocket pods for seven shots each and a range of projectile weapon options. They can make for fun options mixing up playstyles. Even though these tend to necessitate close contact with the enemy. This is not recommended as the Kiowa Warriors protection mostly relies on premonition and staying hidden.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* 4 x AGM-144K Hellfire II, 2 of which while stock
* High 36.8x magnification
* IRST-auto tracking for missiles
* Many weapons options for different playstyles

'''Cons:'''

* No reliable close range defense options against attacking aircraft
* ATAS are unreliable and replace anti-ground ordnance
* Somewhat slow to accelerate in level flight
* Mast-mount sight currently does not allow for "hull-down" playstyle
