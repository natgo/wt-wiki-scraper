== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The AH-64 reached Israel in the 1990s. Israel had been an early investor in the Apache program since 1983. Thus, it became the first nation to operate the AH-64 aside from the United States. The AH-64A was the first version of the Apache, and it was nicknamed ''Peten'' (which means Cobra in Hebrew). The first models participated in a welcome ceremony and had the same systems as the American nations. The number of AH-64As in service capped at 42 units and they participated in several operations during their lifetime. The Peten variant was used against Hezbollah outposts in Lebanon, in Operation Grapes of Wrath, where an AH-64A helicopter shot two Hellfire missiles at an ambulance, killing the civilians inside. More of these incidents occurred during the next years, which resulted in the reluctance by the United States to sell the [[Saraph|AH-64D]] to Israel.

Being introduced in [[Update "Danger Zone"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a competent helicopter, both in combined battles and in helicopter PvE matches. With access to good flight performance, capable missiles, and excellent optics, it's very easy picking up targets if you can avoid being targeted by enemy SPAA. The AGM-114B Hellfire is its main weapon, although it also has access to rocket pods and the AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missile. The Hellfire B is a capable long range ATGM, it's less versatile than the Vikhr but it has more range than most missiles as well as top attack capabilities. Compared to the US variant, the AH-64A lacks access to the AIM-9L, but the AIM-92 is still decently capable, it may only be able to pull 10Gs but, unlike the AIM-9L, has IRCCM, which makes it capable of avoiding flares more easily. One of the biggest flaws of the AH-64A is that it only has access to 60 countermeasures, but overall, is a very solid helicopter with no extreme weak points, that also features a 30 mm cannon with 1,200 rounds of ammunition (the most of all top tier helicopters).

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between two presets:
** 1 x 30 mm M230E-1 cannon (1,200 rpg) + 60 x countermeasures
** 1 x 30 mm M230E-1 cannon + 60 x countermeasures + IRCM

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
