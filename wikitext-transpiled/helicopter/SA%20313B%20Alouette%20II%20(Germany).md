== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German utility helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 "Masters of the Sea"]]. A [[SA.313B Alouette II|French design]], the ''Alouette II'' was in West-German service and could carry a multitude of armaments.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

The Alouette II is a small, nimble utility helicopter capable of maintaining speeds of 225 km/h and is longitudinally stable above 35 km/h.<!-- needs more testing, estimate only --> The Alouette II design is the only helicopter in the game without some form of SAS mode aside from the [[UH-1 (Family)|Huey family]],<!-- needs link --> however since 1.91 the rotorcraft has the option for co-pilot assistance and since 1.89, autopilot assistance while in ATGM binocular view. The Alouette II is unstable with the default trim settings so it is highly recommended to go through test flight to assign the default trim settings.<!-- needs tutorial article because tihs is a special case and almost all joystick pilots never get a single ground kill until after maybe 10 deaths due to the difficulty in learning to fly this especially with the default trim settings. --> The Alouette II has the lowest retreating blade stall speed starting margin of only 185 km/h however retreating blade stalls can easily be recovered from by pitching up and yawing to the right in joystick mode.<!-- TODO: insert example video | trim from https://youtu.be/SSY1tbRruZk?t=194 -->The Alouette also lacks rotor control authority compared to other helicopters and struggles to get into and maintain efficient gliding due to its tendency to yaw and pitch down with the high drag skeleton tail.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->

The Alouette II has no armour. However its small size allows it to easily weave through forests to stay hidden and actively dodge ATGMs. However it is highly prone to rotor linkage, engine and fuel tank damage. The Alouette II does not have infrared imaging devices (but it does have an image intensifier) nor a Radar Warning System.<!-- I haven't confirmed if a dead main pilot and an alive co-pilot will allow the vehicle to live. Afaik it counts as a death. -->

=== Modifications and economy ===

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->
{{main|MG3 (7.62 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 7.62 mm MG3 machine guns (250 rpg = 1,000 total)

The four machine guns are arranged with two above each landing skid. Only the default ammo belt is available. Due to their low calibre, they have limited effectiveness against helicopters and planes, and are almost useless against all but the lightest-armoured ground vehicles. However, they have a high rate of fire (1,200 rpm), which aids damage output at the expense of total firing time.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AS.11}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 4 x AS.11 missiles

Although few missiles can be carried, they are able to severely damage and destroy enemy tanks. It is important to note that although AS.11 missiles are usable, they are much worse than many missiles carried by other helicopters, and that the Alouette's anti-tank armament is weak in general.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
The Alouette doesn't have the power of a conventional helicopter. Being a 1950s helicopter, its engine is very weak compared to its counterparts. Use it at a low altitude and make use of the AS.11 missiles, but beware, the Alouette can only carry 4 of them which is a fairly low amount. Use them wisely. At the start of the battle, just go straight into the air over the ground forces and hunt enemies and pray they don't have SPAA's, or stay low and hidden and snipe enemies. Caution, sometimes there are some other helicopters, but you can solve the problem with AS.11 missiles. Also pray there are no fighters because the Alouette does not have the means to defend itself effectively.

The Alouette's small size makes it highly effective at sneaking zone captures in ground battles. Despite its slow speed, it is still able to get to certain capture zones faster than any ground vehicles in certain domination missions.<!-- domination battles link -->

With joystick controls, it is best to fly the helicopter around 40 to 60 knots as it is stable in that region without SAS / autopilot flight assistance modes however do be aware of the helicopter creeping forward too close to the battlefield. The helicopter is highly susceptible to ATGM hits with SAS / autopilot modes, however it is much easier to fly with those modes active.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Small airframe
* Small rotor system
* Nimble
* High rate of fire machineguns
* Very stable at moderate to high speeds
* Maintains energy well in turns (joystick)

'''Cons:'''

* Spalling from a single hit tend to knock out the engine and/or rotor linkage system
* AS.11 maximum range is 3.5 km
* Missiles are very slow meaning hitting distant targets (+2 km) can be very hard
* Can only carry 4 ATGMs limiting anti-tank usability
* Very low redline speed limit (275 km/h)
* Very low retreating blade stall mechanic speed limit (starts at 185 km/h and gets difficult to handle above 220 km/h, and is only recoverable with full real joystick controls past 260 km/h)

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The light, multipurpose, single-engined SA.313B Alouette II (French for "Skylark") helicopter was developed by the French company Sud-Aviation in the 1960s and was widely used both by civilian and military organizations. Many other countries also obtained a license to manufacture these helicopters. In addition to civilian use, this light helicopter has a rich military history. The SA.313B fought wars in Algeria and Rhodesia and took part in several local conflicts. The model's success is demonstrated by the fact that the SA.313B is still being used for civilian purposes and by the militaries of some countries nowadays.

Since the SA.313B was not routinely equipped with weapons, this issue has been resolved directly in the places and countries where the vehicle has been used to fulfil combat objectives. The helicopter's armament has been rather exotic at times, such as when rifles and machine guns have been mounted in the apertures of the glass-enclosed front cabin. For the purposes of the game, we have chosen more well-founded projects for arming the SA.313B implemented by French and German crews. Machine gun installations comprised of four 7.62mm MG3 light machine guns placed in pairs on the skids using special fixtures. As an anti-tank weapon, the helicopter could carry SNEB unguided rockets, as well as SS.11 guided anti-tank missiles that were located on special transverse tube-shaped beams along the sides of the fuselage.
