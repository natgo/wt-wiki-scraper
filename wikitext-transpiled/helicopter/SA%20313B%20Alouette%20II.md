<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French utility helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.''

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 4 x 7.62 mm MG3 machine guns (250 rpg = 1,000 total)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AS.11}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 4 x AS.11 missiles

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Gets access to rocket pods and machine guns, unlike the [[SA.316B Alouette III|Alouette III]]
* Small size
* Stock ATGMs

'''Cons:'''

* Only 4 anti-tank missiles
* Low maximum speed means that it is slow to react

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
With its excellent versatility, the Alouette II has been a proven and reliable light helicopter for roles such as reconnaissance, liaison, as well as uses in multiple militaries as a trainer. The story begins in 1955 when on March 12th the first prototype flew. Based off of the original SE.3120 Alouette, this design was simpler and easy to produce in comparison, and caught the attention of the French Government. This original design saw the use of Salmson 9 piston-powered engines, but later in development these were replaced by Turbomeca Artouste I turbine engines. The Alouette II the same year became the first rotorcraft to fly over 8,200 meters (26,900 ft), a record which it would break again at 10,900 meters (36,000 ft) in June of 1958. Originally designed, developed, and produced by French company Sud-Est, the company would later merge with Sud-Ouest in 1957 to form the newly named Sud-Aviation, creating some noticeable redesigned from the transition from Sud-Est to the new company. Production of the Alouette II was handled from 1957 to 1970 when Sud-Aviation merged with Nord Aviation, creating Aérospatiale who then, from 1970 to 1975, handled production of the helicopter under the new Aérospatiale nameplate.

The helicopter, while appearing frail, is quite robust as well as versatile in its uses. With a cockpit placed at the forward-most section of its rather small fuselage, it gives the pilot great all visibility through curved windscreens surrounding the cockpit. Entry and seating are also rather simple, with two doors (One on each side) opening up to a seating arrangement of 3-4 seats, including the pilot. This gave the helicopter great use as a transportation vehicle for personnel. The helicopter is powered by a single Turbomeca Artouste IIC6 putting out a downgraded 460 HP compared to the engines original 530 HP, and is situation atop the fuselage towards the rear near the network of struts that form the empennage. Along the tail-section housed the shaft driving the single tail-rotor. With a top-speed of 115 mph, it was by no means sluggish. Being able to retain a cruise speed of 106 mph with a 350-mile service range. This has been proven useful in a multitude of roles, such as anti-tank and anti-ship warfare, being fitted with wire-guided missile launchers as well as torpedoes when necessary. The use of ordnance proved very useful as its small size and relatively low profile gives it great survivability against small arms fire and ground-based anti-air threats. Now an over 60-year-old design, the helicopter is proving itself even today. With multiple militaries continuing to swear by the light-vehicles usability while others have or are planning to replace it. With notable operators such as Sweden, Switzerland, France, Germany, and India it has seen in both military and civil operations with great success and reliability. India for example produced the Alouette II locally with the help of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the name "Lama", built with components of the later Alouette III, featuring the engine and main rotor sections. This variant was further produced, again by HAL, as the "Cheetah", both of which is still used by the Indian Air Force (IAF) as of 2021.
