== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French utility helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.''

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AS.11}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 4 x AS.11 missiles

== Usage in battles ==
''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Carries air-to-surface missiles that are deadly against ground targets at mid-range

'''Cons:'''

* No guns for close combat
* No choice in armament options
* No armour and slow speed

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
Built off of the successful SA.313B Alouette II, the SA.316B Alouette III has been a proven and reliable airframe much like its predecessor. Developed by Sud-Aviation and later built by Aerospatiale, the larger SA.316A took its maiden flight on February 28, 1959, with production following in 1961. Production of the initial variant lasted until 1968 when it was eventually replaced by the SA.316B model. Powered by the Turbomeca Artouste IIIB outputting 570 HP, the Alouette III has incredible power at high altitudes, and has been an invaluable asset in militaries as a light-transport helicopter as well as search & rescue services throughout the world. With its larger size and excellent all-around visibility from the enclosed, rounded glass cockpit as well as the more powerful engine it proved invaluable as a light-attack helicopter as well. Some mission-specific armament can include mounting of a 7.62 mm machine gun on a tripod fitted to the right-side doorway, 20 mm cannon affixed to the left side as well as 2-4 AS.11 anti-tank missiles or 2 Mk.44 torpedoes as required.

The SA.316B was produced in France from 1961 until 1985 when French factories were shut down, although production continues as of 2021 by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) as the Chetak, extending the service life of the Alouette III in multiple militaries well into the future with new parts continuing to be manufactured under the HAL name. Many air forces over the years have claimed usefulness of the SA.316B including France, Argentina, India, and Austria, including some former operators are South Vietnam, Yugoslavia, and Upper Volta to name a few. Notably, Argentina was seen using them in the Falklands war in 1982, with one having been present on the deck of the ARA General Belgrano (formerly the USS Phoenix (CL-46) in US Navy service) during her sinking at the hands of the HMS Conqueror (S48) Churchill-class nuclear submarine. Although it has been retired in service with France, the helicopter is still seen flying in militaries around the world, and will continue to be seen well into 2022 and beyond providing light-attack as well as transport roles whenever needed.
