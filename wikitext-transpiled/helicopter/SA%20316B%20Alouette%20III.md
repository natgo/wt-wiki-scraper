== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
Based on the SA 313B, the '''SA 316 Alouette III''' was developed by Sud-Aviation and later built by Aerospatiale. It took its maiden flight on February 28, 1959, with production following in 1961. It was a larger design that allowed being attached with heavier armament, making it a decent light attack helicopter; however, its main task was for transport of both troops and cargo, being capable of insane amounts of power at high altitudes for the time thanks to its 570 hp engine. Thus, it remained as a very trusted and respected helicopter for search and rescue operations. This good reputation was also due to its good reliability, ease of maintenance, and low price tag. The military variants were fitted with all sorts of armament, from 7.62 mm machine guns to fixed 20 mm cannons, SS.11 ATGMs, Mk.44 torpedoes, and rocket pods. The SA 316A was replaced in 1968 by the '''SA 316B''' model, which had more durable main and tail rotor blades, which improved performance.

Introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]], the '''{{Specs|name}}''' is slow, very sluggish and a very big target. This poses a threat to the player, since it's very easy to be shot down by enemy SPAA if it's not played properly, thus it is only recommended for players that already have experience in flying helicopters. Its main asset is the SS.11 ATGM and its decent range for its BR. While it may lack the thermal sights found in other helicopters and perhaps not match their agility or mobility, these shortcomings can be offset by the skill and proficiency of the player. Excellent situational awareness is essential to staying alive. Use terrain and hide behind trees and hills, peeking up just to launch an ATGM. If possible, ask a team member to mark potential targets using the map or even better, a scout drone if available.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->The '''{{Specs|name}}'''is a very early helicopter, and compared to faster and more agile attack helicopters like the AH-1G at similar BR, the Alouette suffers a lot, with cruise speed that rarely exceeds 180 km/h, you would be one of the slowest helicopters out there, and you will also lose a lot of speed while manoeuvring as is common in all helicopters.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
The Alouette III has no armour to speak off, and with a cockpit made almost entirely of glass, it's very easy being pilot sniped by enemy SPAA or even roof-mounted MGs from tanks and APCs in helicopter Arcade Battles. Also, since the engine has no protection and it's very exposed outside of the fuselage, it's possible being set on fire if the enemy has incendiary projectiles.

=== Modifications and economy ===
{{Specs-Economy}}

Important modifications:

* Flak jacket (To reduce chances of pilot snipe)
* Helicopter frame (To increase structural integrity)
* All the mobility modifications (Since the Alouette is a very slow and sluggish helicopter)

== Armaments ==
{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}
=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->
{{main|AS.11}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

* 4 x AS.11 missiles

The Alouette III can only be equipped with the AS.11 missile, a very slow and early ATGM. Compared to the TOW or HOT-2, it's very sluggish and does not like to turn, avoid drastic changes of course and launch it from higher altitude to increase its firing range.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->
'''Helicopter AB''':

It's a very sluggish and slow helicopter, and it is outmatched by others like the Mi-24A and the AH-1G that are very common at that BR. Its cruise speed at 190 km/h in AB makes it capable of reaching enemy convoys or formations only if it's close, but it's able to take out the enemy SPAA with its relatively long range SS.11 ATGMs, so that the rest of the team can finish the combat and go to the next objective.

'''Realistic/Simulator Battles:'''

Against player controlled ground targets, the Alouette also struggles. Compared to the Z-11WA that sits at a very similar BR, it's less agile, slower, and has worst armament, while enemy SPAA can be very lethal up to 5 km in a neutral matchmaker. Thus it is crucial to stay behind cover, use the hills and terrain to your advantage and only peek above the terrain to launch your AS.11 missile.

Ask team members for help locating targets, if possible, communicate with one of your team members or squadmates so that, with a scout drone, they mark the best targets to take out with the SS.11, especially high priority targets like heavy tanks and other dangerous opponents that can pose a threat to your team.

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Carries air-to-surface missiles that are deadly against ground targets at mid-range
* Good range for the ATGMs if launched from higher altitudes
* Starts with ATGMs and there is no need to investigate them as a modification

'''Cons:'''

* No guns for close combat
* Has just access to mediocre ATGMs
* No armour and slow speed, pilots and engine can be sniped with ease
* Very big target, easier to hit for enemy SPAA

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
[[File:SA 316B Alouette III.jpg|thumb|379x379px|Belgian Marines SA 316B Alouette III]]
Built off of the successful SA.313B Alouette II, the SA.316B Alouette III has been a proven and reliable airframe much like its predecessor. Developed by Sud-Aviation and later built by Aerospatiale, the larger SA.316A took its maiden flight on February 28, 1959, with production following in 1961. Production of the initial variant lasted until 1968 when it was eventually replaced by the SA.316B model. Powered by the Turbomeca Artouste IIIB outputting 570 HP, the Alouette III has incredible power at high altitudes, and has been an invaluable asset in militaries as a light-transport helicopter as well as search & rescue services throughout the world. With its larger size and excellent all-around visibility from the enclosed, rounded glass cockpit as well as the more powerful engine it proved invaluable as a light-attack helicopter as well. Some mission-specific armament can include mounting of a 7.62 mm machine gun on a tripod fitted to the right-side doorway, 20 mm cannon affixed to the left side as well as 2-4 AS.11 anti-tank missiles or 2 Mk.44 torpedoes as required.

The SA.316B was produced in France from 1961 until 1985 when French factories were shut down, although production continues as of 2021 by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) as the Chetak, extending the service life of the Alouette III in multiple militaries well into the future with new parts continuing to be manufactured under the HAL name. Many air forces over the years have claimed usefulness of the SA.316B including France, Argentina, India, and Austria, including some former operators are South Vietnam, Yugoslavia, and Upper Volta to name a few. Notably, Argentina was seen using them in the Falklands war in 1982, with one having been present on the deck of the ARA General Belgrano (formerly the USS Phoenix (CL-46) in US Navy service) during her sinking at the hands of the HMS Conqueror (S48) Churchill-class nuclear submarine. Although it has been retired in service with France, the helicopter is still seen flying in militaries around the world, and will continue to be seen well into 2022 and beyond providing light-attack as well as transport roles whenever needed.
