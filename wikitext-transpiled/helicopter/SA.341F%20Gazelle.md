== Description ==

<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->

The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French utility helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 "Locked On"]].

Initially designed by Sud Aviation in 1966, the Gazelle helicopter project (SA.340, SA.341 and SA.342) was continued by AÃ©rospatiale as a French five-seat transport, scout, and light attack helicopter manufactured in both France and the United Kingdom. Manufacturing licences were granted, allowing a Yugoslavian company SOKO and the Arab British Helicopter Company in Egypt to also produce these aircraft.

The Turbomeca Artouste Astazou IIB turbine engine powers the Gazelle. Initial testing of this helicopter utilised a standard tail-rotor taken from the Alouette, however, design changes switched to a Fenestron-style tail, the first helicopter to do so. The Fenestron tail or "fantail" differs from a conventional tail rotor as it contains eight to eighteen blades housed within the tail unit of the helicopter. Advantages of the Fenestron include substantial noise reduction, protection of tail rotor damage from contact with other objects, and protection of ground personnel working around the tail section. With the aid of the Fenestron tail, the Gazelle was the world's fastest helicopter in its class during its early years.

In the service of the French, the Gazelle SA.341F was utilised as a light support helicopter equipped with a 20 mm GLAT M.261 cannon and various rockets, anti-tank missiles and air-to-air missiles. Over the years, the Gazelle was removed from anti-tank duty and reconfigured for operations as an Air Observation Post directing artillery fire, airborne forward air controller directing ground-attack troops, troop casualty evacuations and communication relay operations.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}

<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->

Has no armour plating present on the vehicle, this helicopter is incredibly vulnerable to all types of fire. The exposed engine is also vulnerable to being damaged or set alight, dooming the helicopter if hit.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}

<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

{{main|GIAT M.621 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

- A choice between two presets:
  ** Without offensive armament
  ** 1 x 20 mm GIAT M.621 cannon (1,000 rpg) + 32 x countermeasures

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}

<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

{{main|HOT-1|HOT-2 TOW|Mistral|FFAR Mighty Mouse|GIAT M.621 (20 mm)}}

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:

- 1 x 20 mm GIAT M.621 cannon (1,000 rpg) + 7 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets
- 1 x 20 mm GIAT M.621 cannon (1,000 rpg) + 2 x HOT-1 missiles
- 1 x 20 mm GIAT M.621 cannon (1,000 rpg) + 2 x HOT-2 TOW missiles
- 1 x 20 mm GIAT M.621 cannon (1,000 rpg) + 2 x Mistral missiles

== Usage in battles ==

<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

This helicopter has three main playstyles, centred around the selected loadout.

- Anti-Tank: Using ATGMs, get within 4 km of a target, while remaining hidden by trees or buildings, and guide your missile to the target. Focus on tanks without reactive armour, as they may render your missiles ineffective, and waste your time. After expending your missiles, it is best to return to the helipad and resupply.

- Rocketeer: Using unguided rockets, fly low over the battlefield and assault a single tank with a precise salvo, and then retreat behind cover.

- Air defence: Using AAMs, sneak behind enemy lines, and land in an obscured area, or behind cover, and wait for aircraft or helicopters to get near your allies. Then surprise attack them with your missiles and cannon fire. This will make short work of any helicopter, and most slow-flying aircraft.

Overall, you want to avoid direct line-of-sight to your enemies, as they likely can spot you faster than you can spot them, and engage you at longer range. Surface-to-air missiles are a serious threat, as they can take you by surprise, and you have no radar detector to warn you of their presence. The same applies to radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.

In Helicopter Battles [PvE] the Gazelle is notably better than either of the two preceding helicopters, finally unlocking AAMs with a greater range (5.5km) than 3/4km ATGMs. However, due to the limited armament (2 missiles), the Gazelle is limited to strafing ground targets and trying to lock onto enemy planes.

'''Notable Enemies:'''

- [[Mi-28N]], [[Mi-24P]], [[Mi-24V]]: Due to the gazelle's lack of a MAW system, it is still possible to shoot it down with the AAMs these helicopters carry. Their Armor also means that it is harder for you to shoot them down in return.
- [[Ka-50]], [[Ka-52]]: Both can outrange you, meaning that killing one is the result of their mistakes
- [[EC-665 Tiger UHT]]: Similar to the [[Ka-50]], the Tiger has access to IR-guided ATGMS with long range.
- [[AH-1 (Family)|AH-1]]: Highly manoeuvrable with a high volume of fire, the Cobra family of helicopters is incredibly good at dogfighting. Engage from long range, or use superior speed to flee.

=== Pros and cons ===

<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

== History ==

<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->

The Aerospatiale SA.341 was developed to meet a French Army Light Aviation (ALAT) requirement for a new observation helicopter to replace the Alouette II. Aerospatiale designated the project as X 300, but the prototype's designation was SA.340.

The prototype first flew in 1967, and it seemed outwardly similar to the Alouette II. It did use the Astazou II powerplant and transmission system, but there were a number of differences. For one thing, it introduced a fully enclosed fuselage and a cockpit with seating and controls for two pilots rather than one (although it could be flown by only one). Also introduced on the SA.340 were the fenestron - a shrouded tail rotor - and the Bolkow-type main rotor.

The British became interested in the project as the SA.340 was nearing completion, so a joint development and production sharing agreement was signed on 22 February 1967; it was officially confirmed in 1968. The first prototype (SA.340.001) flew for the first time on 7 April 1967, and the second prototype first flew in April 1968.

Four pre-production aircraft, redesignated as the SA.341, were built next. The third pre-production SA.341 was built to British Army requirements and was then shipped to Britain for testing as the AH.Mk.1. Notably, the first pre-production SA.341 established three new speed records for helicopters of its class on 14 May 1970.

On 6 August 1971, the first French production SA.341 (SA.341.1001) was cleared for test flights. The production version had a longer fuselage, a larger tail, and a more powerful Astazou IIIA engine.

The SA.341F Gazelle was a French Military light support version of the SA.341 Gazelle, which had the improved Astazou IIIC engine. 166 were produced, and many were armed with a GIAT 20 mm M.621 cannon in a nose turret. They could be armed with rocket pods, Euromissile HOT anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), or Mistral air-to-air missiles (AAMs). A number of SA.341F Gazelles remain in service with the ALAT.
