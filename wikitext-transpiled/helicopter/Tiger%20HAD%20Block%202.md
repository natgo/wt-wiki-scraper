== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. The Block 2, an advanced version of the EC-665 Tiger HAD, was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. It was purely made to increase the ground-attack and anti-tank capability of the Tiger HAD, by adding Spike ER Fire-and-Forget missiles. 

Primarily designed for air-to-ground combat, the EC 665 Tiger is a result of European defense collaboration between France and Germany, initiated during the Cold War era to counter ground threats, especially tanks. Born out of the 1975 agreement and developed by Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters), this attack helicopter combined stealth technology, advanced avionics, and potent firepower, making it highly agile and versatile.

This variant however remains identical in game (at least in game) to the Tiger HAD with the exception of its camouflage and Spike ER missiles, making it more potent than the German Tiger UHT which has slightly shorter range on its missiles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.
