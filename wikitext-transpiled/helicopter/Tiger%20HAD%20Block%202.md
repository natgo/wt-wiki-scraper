== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
For the French air force, the rapid obsolescence of their existing fleet of [[EC-665 Tiger HAP]] helicopters was becoming a serious problem; as a result, the decision was made to modernise the design to the [[EC-665 Tiger HAD|HAD]] variant. However, their development did not end there: in 2014, a new modernisation was proposed under the designation '''Block 2''', receiving a number of new capabilities including new software, the ability to use Spike-ER guided missiles from the Israeli company Rafael, as well as the ability to be operated from ships. France plans to upgrade all its Eurocopter Tiger helicopters to the HAD Block 2 version by 2025.

The '''EC-665 Tiger HAD Block 2''' was introduced in [[Update "Kings of Battle"]]. The new modification of the Tiger differs from the previous [[EC-665 Tiger HAD|Tiger HAD]] only in the new Israeli Spike-ER air-to-surface guided missiles, which operate on a "fire and forget" principle with their own infrared seeker. Similarly to the German [[EC-665 Tiger UHT]], these missiles allow you to deliver rapid strikes against enemy armoured vehicles while minimising the chance of being detected and destroyed by enemy SAM systems. To protect against aircraft, the Block 2 also has a set of Stinger or Mistral air-to-air missiles, and in case of emergency there is a nose-mounted 30 mm rapid-fire cannon.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->
