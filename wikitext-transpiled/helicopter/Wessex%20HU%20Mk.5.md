<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Westland Wessex''' was a British modification of the American multipurpose [[H-34]] helicopter. In the late 1950s, Westland Helicopters began developing a new multipurpose helicopter, taking into account the experience of licensed production of American-developed Dragonfly and Whirlwind helicopters. The H-34 was chosen as the base model, the documentation and one copy of which the company received from Sikorsky. In 1958, a modified version of the helicopter took to the skies with a Napier Gazelle turboshaft engine instead of the standard piston engine. The helicopter was initially developed for the needs of the Royal Navy, but later the vehicle also entered service with Air Force units, as well as the Australian Navy and the armed forces of a number of other states.

One modification of the Wessex was the '''HU Mk.5''', intended for special forces units. Designed for amphibious and search-and-rescue missions, the HU Mk.5 was powered by two Rolls-Royce Gnome turboshaft engines. The Wessex HU Mk.5 has been used as a military transport and attack helicopter in a number of armed conflicts around the world, from Cyprus and Malaysia to the Falklands. In total, about 100 helicopters of the HU Mk.5 modification were built, which were in service with Great Britain until the 1990s.

The '''Wessex HU Mk.5''' was introduced in [[Update "Alpha Strike"]]. At first glance, it is not much different from the [[H-34]], but the main difference lies in the new power plant, consisting of two Rolls-Royce Gnome engines, which provide a significant increase in power and flight capabilities compared with the original H-34. Another important difference is the presence of 7.62 mm machine guns and an expanded arsenal of suspended weapons, which, in addition to unguided rockets, includes new AS.11 and AS.12 guided missiles with increased armour penetration. However, much like the H-34, the Wessex lacks any armour protection.

Westland Helicopters began work on the Wessex in the late 1950s after the relative success of their previous American origin Dragonfly and Whirlwind licence built designs. Following the acquisition rights to produce the Sikorsky S58/H-34, a singular S58 was transferred to Britain as a development and template vehicle. By 1958, a domestically produced and redeveloped version powered by a Napier Gazelle turboshaft engine, rather than the piston engine of the Sikorsky design, designated the Wessex HAS.1 (Helicopter Anti-Submarine), would take to the skies for the first time. Entering service initially with the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force would later adopt the type too. In addition to this, the Royal Australian Navy and several other customers that Westland could sell too.

The HAS.3 would further enhance the systems on board the Wessex, followed by the HU.5 Commando variant. Primarily a troop transport and also utilised in the Search and Rescue role, the HU.5 employed a further improved power plant in the form of two Rolls-Royce Gnome engines. Serving all over the world from Cyprus, to the Indonesiaâ€“Malaysia conflict and the Falklands War, the Wessex was operated in utility, lift, transport and attack roles.

Retiring finally in the early 2000s, the Wessex was finally replaced in all major roles it maintained by the Westland Sea King which it had served alongside for many years.
