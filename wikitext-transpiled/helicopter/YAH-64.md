== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
The '''Hughes YAH-64''' was the prototype for the successful AH-64 Apache series attack helicopter, which is in service in numerous countries across the world. Following the cancellation of the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne from the U.S. Army's Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) program on August 9, 1972, as a result of its huge airframe and poor all-weather performance, the U.S. Army launched the Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) program on August 17, 1972. Drawing from the experience of the Vietnam War, the U.S. Army envisioned an attack helicopter with the requirements of a lower minimum top speed of 269 km/h, a twin-engine configuration for better survivability, heavier weaponry, and a longer combat radius than the existing AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter already in service. Bell, the Boeing Vertol/Grumman group, Hughes, Lockheed Martin, and Sikorsky all submitted proposals for the new AAH program. In July 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense chose Bell (also known as the Bell Helicopter Company) and Hughes (later acquired by McDonnell Douglas, which made it a subsidiary and renamed it McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems) as the final candidates for the AAH program, where both companies were instructed to construct their prototype helicopters for flight testing. Hughes' prototype YAH-64 first flew on September 30, 1975, whereas Bell's prototype YAH-63 first flew on October 1, 1975. In 1976, Hughes' YAH-64 prototype was chosen over Bell's YAH-63 prototype, primarily due to its more damage-tolerant four-blade main rotor and more stable landing gear layout. Initially, the U.S. Army intended that the YAH-63 would be armed with a 30 mm cannon and 16 TOW anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). However, as the still-in-development air-to-ground missile (AGM-114) Hellfire promised better range and lethality than the TOW ATGM, the anti-tank missile armament specification was later changed to 16 AGM-114 Hellfires, which became the mainstay of the U.S. Army attack helicopter anti-armour weaponry.

Introduced in [[Update "Direct Hit"]], the YAH-64 is a two-seat, twin-engine ground attack helicopter with the gunner (front) and pilot (rear) sitting in tandem, similar to the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter. Equipped with a thermal imaging device and armed with the AGM-114 Hellfire B variant as its primary anti-armour weapon, it can easily spot targets from a long distance and engage targets as far away as 8 km using semi-active laser homing (SALH), which is significantly beyond the range of most SPAA vehicles, with the exception of some radar-guided SAM missiles. Players can also choose to equip Hydra-70 M247 rockets for light anti-armour purposes, which is made easier by the installation of a ballistic computer on board. As an early prototype of the iconic AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, the YAH-64 lacks infrared countermeasure (IRCM) and flare/chaff countermeasures. It also lacks any air-to-air missiles, limiting its capacity to engage air targets effectively.

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* 1 x 30 mm M230E-1 cannon, chin turret (1,200 rpg)

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

=== Pros and cons ===
<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as "bad", "good" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as "inadequate" and "effective".'' -->

'''Pros:'''

* Activation of 3rd person lock by changing MFD on the pilot's view
* Amazing 30 mm cannon, can easily take out most tanks, and when locked can take out jets and helicopters too
* Can carry up to 16 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles
* Can use ballistic computer to dramatically increase the effectiveness of Hydra rockets
* Can lock targets for 30 mm cannon to automatically track
* Excellent thermals
* Well armoured for a helicopter, can take 2-3 critical hits to take it down, may survive hits from SAMs

'''Cons:'''

* Not equipped with air-to-air missiles
* Does not have as many armament options as the regular AH-64
* The 30 mm cannon is relatively inaccurate
* Lack of IRCM and countermeasures
