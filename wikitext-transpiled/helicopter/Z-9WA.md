== Description ==
<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the helicopter, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->
'''Harbin Z-9WA''' was a modification of the [[Z-9W]] developed in 2005. As part of the upgrade, the helicopter received a new optical system with a thermal imager, improved avionics, and the ability to carry state-of-the-art weaponry. Besides service in the Chinese army, a certain number of these helicopters have also been supplied for export.

Introduced in [[Update "Drone Age"]], the Z-9WA remains a relatively fast and lightweight machine. While it may lag behind counterparts at its BR due to its original design as a transport helicopter, the armament onboard is available in greater numbers and allows the Z-9WA to stand a chance against enemy targets with better ATGMs and more AAMs. The Z-9WA also has new systems such as thermal optics, MAWS, and countermeasures that make it better at hunting tanks and more slippery against enemy air defences.

== General info ==
=== Flight performance ===
{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}
<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->
The Z-9WA shares a similar mobility to the Z-9W as it didn't receive a powerplant upgrade. It does not have the speed of dedicated attack helicopters but still retains the classic high agility of the Z-9 family. The installation of the new armament and electronics does not cause significant performance reduction, and it can still be utilized to sneak behind enemy lines and strike them from the rear.

=== Survivability and armour ===
{{Specs-Heli-Armour}}
<!-- ''Examine the survivability of the helicopter. Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->
Players of the previous Z-9s will be extremely familiar with the overall protection of the Z-9WA: this version still doesn't provide any extra protection against projectiles or shrapnel from enemies. Any hit will very likely cause damage to component or the pilots; but it still comes with self-sealing fuel tanks that might help survive if set ablaze.

=== Offensive armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Offensive}}
<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the helicopter, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in battle, also what ammunition belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->

The '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:

* A choice between two presets:
** Without offensive armament
** 72 x countermeasures

The Z-9WA is the first Chinese helicopter to have flare/chaff countermeasures, and the supply of 72 is in fact more generous than the later [[Z-19]] and [[Z-10]]. An onboard MAWS makes it easier to use these countermeasures.

=== Suspended armament ===
{{Specs-Heli-Suspended}}
<!-- ''Describe the helicopter's suspended armament: additional cannons under the winglets, any bombs, and rockets. Since any helicopter is essentially only a platform for suspended weaponry, this section is significant and deserves your special attention. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->

The Z-9WA's primary weapons resemble the previous Z-9W, the main differences coming from the doubled missile capacity and improved ATGM models.

The HJ-8 missile now comes in two improved variants. The stock HJ-8E is a significant improvement over the humble HJ-8A used by previous helicopters: it has the same warhead as the HJ-8C with a tandem charge and 590 mm of penetration, and now an improved rocket motor that boosts the range to 4 km and improves the flight speed slightly to 260 m/s. The HJ-8E packs an adequate punch against tanks with steel or reactive armour but might have issues against composite armour because of its below average raw penetration. The unlockable HJ-8H has an improved warhead with 750 mm of penetration that largely fixes this issue, and also has improved TNT equivalent for destroying light targets through overpressure. Among contemporary helicopter ATGMs, the HJ-8H is most similar to the [[HOT-2 TOW]]: both have good ranges (greater than [[BGM-71D TOW-2]], less than [[9M114 Shturm]]), slow flight speeds (less than TOW-2 and half that of the Shturm), and powerful warheads. The HJ-8H has 150 mm less raw penetration than the HOT-2, but the tandem charge allows it to consistently destroy common Soviet ERA-equipped tanks like the [[T-72B]] and [[T-72AV (TURMS-T)]], very impressive for a missile that only weighs 13 kg.

A newer offering added after the Z-9WA's initial introduction is the AKD-9 semi-active laser homing missile, giving pilots a taste of what to expect on the later [[Z-19]]. Though it isn't a major upgrade over the HJ-8H in terms of damage, it flies significantly faster and has enhanced range, making it the Haitun's most effective ATGM overall.

The TY-90 returns as a highly effective air-to-air missile that can take down even manoeuvring fighters. If the Z-9W's capacity of four TY-90s was enough to act as a "flying SPAA", the Z-9WA's eight TY-90s are often enough to suppress enemy aircraft for an entire match. It is also effective against helicopters, but it is important to remember that many of the Z-9WA's contemporaries have HIRSS or IRCM systems that make them more difficult to lock and boast anti-air weapons of their own.

The other armament options of unguided rockets, machine gun pods, and cannons are the same as on the Z-9W. However they should only be seriously considered for the initial stock grind when only one hardpoint of HJ-8Es is available. The Z-9WA is still not suitable for close-range combat due to its fragility, limited hardpoints, and lack of an internal cannon, especially since it can face advanced SPAA vehicles.

== Usage in battles ==
<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a "guide" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->

Players will easily get on hand with the WA variant thanks to its mostly identical flight performance and similar weaponry to the Z-9W. The Z-9WA has an unrivaled TVD camera with very high magnification at x81, which is very helpful for those who struggle to find targets in an intense battlefield, compounded by bad weather or night conditions. It also now has an auto-tracker for much easier targeting, though it is currently implemented as a TV system as opposed to an IRST and therefore does not function in night battles. The Z-9WA's main drawback when it comes to tank hunting is its ATGMs; the HJ-8s are both slow and limited in range, and the AKD-9s are better but generally worse in performance than the contemporary AGM-114B Hellfire. It's important to make good use of the high optical zoom to target the weak spots of enemy tanks.

The TY-90 is the same as all its predecessor/successors with its extremely good manoeuvrability. Though the missile hasn't changed, at the Z-9WA's higher battle rating it's common to face supersonic jets with countermeasures, so some additional consideration is required when using it. The 20 G raw overload is now below average and it maintains competitive agility by having gradual acceleration and a long motor burn time, giving it ample time to course correct and keep up with a moving target. However, this means that it's not difficult for a contemporary jet to simply outrun the TY-90 if they are at high speed and it was launched from more than a few kilometers away. The seeker features a moderate amount of ECCM that, while not so foolproof as an [[AIM-9M]]'s, still helps to avoid being spoofed by flares. Keep the TY-90's drawbacks in mind and try to keep an initially low profile versus aircraft, biding time until an opportune shot that the target will not be able to easily outrun or dodge.

While there are rocket pods and gunpods at your disposal, they are more efficient at helicopter EC for light targets such as recoilless guns, light tanks, APCs, etc.

Like the Z-9W, make sure to sneak around in the battlefield for maximum survivability as it is still unprotected; but thanks to better avionics, it will have a faster searching time than predecessors and helps a lot for staying out of the battlefield. Alternatively it can still serve as another "flying SPAA" and make sure that enemy aircraft will hit the ground before they have the chance to do damage to your team. The Z-9WA can also be a serious multirole helicopter because of its enhanced payload: for pilots who want to be prepared for anything, one pylon of four ATGMs and one pylon of four TY-90s is enough to perform some solid anti-aircraft work while being a credible tank hunter.

== History ==
<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block "/History" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->
The Z-9WA helicopter began with the development of the Harbin Z-9 (WZ-9) nicknamed "Haitun" (海豚, meaning "Dolphin") which is essentially a license built variant of the French AS365 "Dauphin" by Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation. The first Z-9 flew in 1981, after a successful deal signed in 1980 with Aérospatiale (now Airbus Helicopters) of France to produce a variant of the well-regarded Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin. The first variants began with heavy dependence on French subsystems and components, however by the time of the introduction of the Z-9B most parts were already made in China, without depending on external suppliers.

The helicopter features Twin turboshaft engines, a crew of 1-2, has a cruise speed of 267 km/h, a range of up to 700 km, service ceiling of 5,400 m and a takeoff weight of 4,300 kg. The Z-9W and Z-9WA where later introduced, with important adjustments, mainly the addition of weapon systems and electronic subsystems.

The Z-9WA is the upgraded version of the Z-9W with revised pylon that was bolted onto the airframe instead of going through the main airframe itself, a new 3-in-1 tracker with daytime/TVD/laser tracking and some revision on the nose of the helicopter, depending on the configuration, the helicopter might even include a nose mounted radar. The project was started in November 2001 and contracts were signed in January next year, first seen as part of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison Aviation Corps at Shek Kong Airfield (石崗機場) in the early 2000s. The Z-9WA was the dedicated attack helicopter of PLAGF Aviation Corps before Project 941 (Z-10) until the Z-9WA's successor, the Z-19, came into service.
