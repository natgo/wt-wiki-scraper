The A-29 joined multiple bombing runs against Japanese-occupied areas throughout 1943; it was one of the cornerstone bombers of the NRAF before they eventually upgraded to American [[B-25J-30 (China)|B-25s]] in late 1944, while the remaining A-29s were abandoned in Chongqing and no further records of these aircraft were left.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a_29_hudson Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Hudson Mk V (Great Britain)]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lockheed}}\n{{China bombers}}"}}
