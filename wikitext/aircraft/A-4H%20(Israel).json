If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe A-4H is a versatile aircraft which fits into a wide range of play styles. Varying from close air support (CAS) to base bomber or even as an air superiority fighter. Players who yield such a tool as the A-4H Skyhawk have a lot of options when it comes to play style choices.\n\nGround Realistic Battles (RB)\n\nFor those interested in its CAS abilities, it comes with a wide range of ordnance and a radar warning receiver (RWR). The best way to utilise the plane in this role is to use the ordnance to aid allied ground units in tight situations and clear a path for them to reach their respective objectives. RWR will help you by making you aware of any enemy or allied Anti-Air systems that choose to make you their prey.\n\nAir Battles (AB/RB/SB)\n\nFor those interested in Air Battles, there are multiple ways you can make yourself an asset to the team. You can use your very respectable bomb and rocket payloads  to help allies destroy enemy bases and ground units to bleed tickets.\n\nThe A-4H can also go in light as an air superiority fighter. The plane has a good rate of climb and roll rate, meaning you can employ hit and run tactics on your opponents, or go all-in and get personal with the enemy aircraft. The A-4's biggest opponents are the  Mig-15/17 and G.91 R series. The A-4H is a very capable plane in the right hands but is hard to fly, especially against a proven aircraft such as the MiG-17. The poor energy retention can put you at a huge disadvantage against such opponents if you are not careful in managing your air speed. This means that you should only engage in tight and personal fights when you are sure you can finish them quickly and escape. For those who are newer, staying close to allied teammates and helping each other is generally a very effective tactic in the A-4H and generally yields the the best chance for survival and success in the Skyhawk. For those more daring, flying solo is very possible but requires and higher level of awareness and tactical knowledge, the unforgiving nature of the plane depends on it.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Excellent acceleration and climb rate\n* Good roll rate\n* Good instantaneous turn rate\n* Good variety of ground attack ordnance\n* Twin 30 mm DEFA cannons will take down any enemy aircraft\n* Can carry 3 x additional 20 mm Mk11 cannons\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Wings rip easily in tight high speed manoeuvres\n* Low ammo on main guns\n* Poor energy retention\n* Wing slats extend only at very low speeds\n* No air-to-air missiles (AAMs)\n* Only one fuel tank is self-sealing (the one in the fuselage)\n* Carrying heavy payload significantly reduces flight performance\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
