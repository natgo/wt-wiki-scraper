It was introduced in [[Update \"Direct Hit\"]].\n\nSharing most of the performance and appearance of a [[Q-5A]], A-5C comes with AAMs and Western bombs which might be more familiar to players of the western countries. With its excellent climb rate as an attacker, a pair of advanced AAMs, and somewhat superior manoeuvrability to enemies at similar BR, it can still prove deadly to enemies at even higher BR, surprising them with what a MiG-19-based aircraft can do.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Enemy cannons and missiles will make short work of the A-5C so avoiding incoming fire is paramount. The twin engines are likely to be damaged by attacks from the rear, but having two of them offers some extra survivability since it is capable of flying back to base on one engine. The aircraft also remains somewhat controllable if one of the elevators is blown off.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

These are significantly less powerful than the contemporary [[J-6A]]'s [[Type 30-1 (30 mm)|Type 30]]/[[NR-30 (30 mm)|NR-30]] cannons due to their lower explosive content, rate of fire, kinetic damage, and muzzle velocity. They typically require a solid burst of hits to destroy a target instead of dismembering enemy fighters with a brief touch. On the bright side, they have more ammunition with about 8 seconds of firing time. Lead generously and try to get close to your opponent before unloading. Using them against ground targets should not be a priority since their penetration is no higher than a heavy machine gun and the ammo supply is not plentiful.\n\nThe default belt has an even mix of FI-T and AP-I rounds and should be satisfactory from the start. Gun convergence is not a major issue since the cannons are mounted close to the centerline of the aircraft in the wing roots, and is up to personal preference.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAlthough historically an attack aircraft, the A-5C is not a first-rate ground attacker in Air RB since its ordnance is rather anaemic compared to other jets at its battle rating. It cannot destroy a base with its four 250 kg/500 lb bombs, but this is still an option for supplementary research points when grinding: stay at low altitude, loop around to a side base, drop the bombs, then head towards the center of the map to join the furball. Going after AI ground vehicles with the bombs and rockets can also be successful provided that other jets do not arrive quickly to crash the party.\n\nThe A-5C can outrun many of the enemy fighters it faces, but active combat at transonic or supersonic speeds should be avoided because of the control compression. The best way to reverse enemies is to pull them into a climbing spiral or other vertical manoeuvres; the A-5C has enough of the MiG-19's climb and thrust-to-weight characteristics to energy fight in a similar manner, the declining airspeed relaxes the control compression, and a stalled-out target is easier to gun down. It should be obvious that actual MiG-19 models such as the [[MiG-19S (Germany)|German MiG-19S]] are better than the A-5C in almost every regard when it comes to air-to-air combat. Be very careful about engaging them.\n\nWhile its Chinese cousins lacked any form of AAM for self-defense, the A-5C comes with a pair of AIM-9Ps or Matra R550 Magics which prove very deadly at the BR; AIM-9P can cause extensive damage to the enemy team at range and Magic is among the best AAMs in game which can easily terminate any targets within a 2 km radius. So bringing 2 of them solely for dogfights or as self-defense are the way to go.\n\nThe RWR will not stop any missiles by itself, but knowing if there are pursuers or radar locks behind you reduces the chance of being surprised by a missile or cannon burst out of nowhere. The RWR is not a replacement for situational awareness, it is still the pilot's duty to look for approaching enemies and missile launches whenever possible. While A-5C comes with countermeasures, it has only 18 of them - only sufficient for one or two near misses from enemy missiles, so evade enemy missiles with manoeuvres for the best result and only spend your flares as a last ditch measure to save yourself.\n\n'''Ground RB'''\n\nThe A-5C is a light ground attacker whose rockets are limited in capacity and whose bombs are limited in power. It's generally best to use up the rockets and bombs in one or two passes, then switch to providing air cover. If there are no enemy aircraft or helicopters around, the A-5C can quickly zoom back to the airfield and restock its weapons for another run. Keep in mind that A-5C has no CCIP capabilities, therefore pilots may need practice to drop bombs or unleash rockets accurately.\n\nThe A-5C has 90 mm HEAT rockets, which can be used successfully from many angles provided that enough hits are landed to knock out crew members. This is a challenge without a ballistic computer and the diving paths required to hit targets from above run the risk of crashing into the ground or presenting an easy target for SPAA, so definitely prioritize light vehicles when possible.\n\nThe 500 lbs bombs, which are dropped individually, do not have much explosive filler and need to be delivered with decent accuracy in order to score kills. This can be a tall order for a supersonic jet aircraft like the A-5C, especially against moving targets, so consider dropping several (or even all of them) at once. Carpet bombing a capture point or street can lead to decent results. A short fuse can be used due to the bombs' limited blast radius. For those familiar with the Q-5s, keep in mind that they carried high-drag bombs, meaning that you had to be really close to your targets before dropping them; these low-drag Mk.82 bombs should be easier to use.\n\nThe A-5C's radar warning receiver can help detect SPAA vehicles, but be sure to visually inspect the battlefield as well. Some players turn off their radars for greater stealth and some SPAAs lack radars entirely. The majority of SAMs are manually guided by their operators and thus flares will not work against them; the main exceptions are the Japanese [[Type 93]] and the Italian [[SIDAM 25 (Mistral)]]. Do not head-on or stall out in full view of an SPAA, and even when the coast appears to be clear, avoid flying in straight lines.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

In mid-1979, Egypt became their first overseas customer with orders of new jets and engines; meanwhile, Pakistan had concluded that the main culprit for the lost of 3rd Indo-Pakistan War was because of the lack of a dedicated ground attacker, in fear of possible assaults from USSR via Afghanistan, they were in dire need for a new ground attacker.\n\nPakistan then sent 2 teams of staffs to Nanchang Aircraft Corporation and it was concluded that Q-5 would be a fair option for an attacker with its low-altitude performance and price, but it would also be upgraded with Western avionics, weaponries and came with IR AAMs for self-defense. Based on the Q-5IA that was still under development, Nanchang Aircraft Corp. built 3 prototypes in 1982 and the newly designated A-5C was delivered to the PAF from early 1983 to 1984, with 54 of them built through out the year.\n\nA-5C was then delivered to three different PAF squadrons and some of them retired as early as 1991, while the remaining were kept in commission until mid-2011, when the more-advanced JF-17 Thunder replaced them as a multi-role fighter. Other export variants remain in service at Myanmar and Sudan.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a_5c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|qvUGjLvcJX0|'''Should You Buy The A-5C? - Premium Review''' - ''Sako Sniper''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Q-5 early]]\n* [[Q-5A]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7284-development-new-top-tier-ztz99-iii-and-pre-order-for-a-5c-en|[Devblog] New top-tier ZTZ99-III and pre-order for A-5C]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Nanchang}}\n{{China jet aircraft}}\n{{China premium aircraft}}"}}
