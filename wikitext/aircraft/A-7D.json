Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nDesign characteristics of the {{PAGENAME}} put its survivability in a mixed bag. While it has all the necessary traits to survive in a missile-frequent battle-rating, the plane design leaves survival beyond a hit minimal.\n\nThe radar warning receiver comes default with the plane, meaning it will be able to sense when an enemy plane has pinged it during its radar search, or is locking on for a {{annotation|SARH|Semi-Active Radar-Homing}} missile. This can give enough heads-up to an {{PAGENAME}} pilot to react appropriately to the situation.\n\nOnce upgrading the {{PAGENAME}} through Tier I modifications, the {{PAGENAME}} can acquire flares to use in the event when an aircraft gets on the {{PAGENAME}} tail (which will be frequent given the {{PAGENAME}}'s poor turn rate) and fires an infrared missile. This can be really useful to thwart off a missile-run by an enemy diving onto the {{PAGENAME}}. The {{PAGENAME}} receives a large amount of flares too, with 120 units able to be expended, meaning that the {{PAGENAME}} can keep infrared missiles off for quite some time.\n\nThese flares can help out when using the {{PAGENAME}} to penetrate enemy lines and to reach distant ground target such as bases or the such. Such an attack will inevitably be discovered by the enemy high-performance jets at this battle-rating. One way to use the flares in this situation is to activate \"Periodic Flares Release\" control so that the flare automatically come out of the aircraft when the enemy begins closing in. While it may illuminate the {{PAGENAME}} to other enemy's visuals, it will deter easy infrared missile shots so that an enemy 3-5 km behind the {{PAGENAME}} can't just carelessly pop off a missile and know it is a certain hit. This should allow enough time for the {{PAGENAME}} to successfully drop its payload onto its target and fly off hoping to either make it back to the airfield safety or make it into a friendly airspace envelope safely. However, without much external aid, it will be hard to shake off tailing enemy that follows through from the beginning of the attack run to its aftermath.\n[[File:A-7D Wing Fuel Tank.jpg|x250px|thumb|The large, not self-sealing, wing fuel tank in the A-7D.]]\n\nHowever, the overall {{PAGENAME}} design leaves no space for error when it comes to getting hit. There are no empty spaces in the aircraft that can be hit and the plane is left out without too much trouble. Firstly, all but one of the four fuel tanks on the {{PAGENAME}} is not self-sealing, which is bad for the fuel storage on the plane. Secondly, one of the fuel tanks is ''huge'' and makes up a good portion of the wingspan (and it's a not self-sealing one at that). If this tank is hit, it will leak a good portion of the plane fuel. That is, if the tank does not catch fire from the hit, and it will burn continuously as it is representing a large fuel reserve and is not self-sealing. Having this or other fuel tanks get hit is a crippling blow to the {{PAGENAME}}.\n\nThese traits mean the {{PAGENAME}} deals with the aftermath of a hit terribly, but it does have enough design feature so that missiles are not an instant doom for the {{PAGENAME}}.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

CCRP (Bombs)\n|-\n| {{Tick}} || {{Tick}} || {{Tick}} || {{Tick}}\n|-\n|}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* A choice between two presets:\n** 1 x 20 mm M61A1 cannon, chin-mounted (1,000 rpg)\n** 1 x 20 mm M61A1 cannon + 120 x countermeasures\n\nThe 20 mm M61A1 Vulcan is an excellent multi-purpose weapon that can fit into the {{PAGENAME}}'s role. With the high rate of fire of 6,000 RPM, the M61A1 can lay down massive amount of fire that can ensure hits onto the target.\n\nDue to the rate of fire, the {{PAGENAME}} only needs to fire into the enemy's path only for a moment that the enemy aircraft would be pelted with multiple 20 mm shells. If this does not instantly destroy the aircraft, more than likely a critical control component has been damaged that a follow-up shot is made easier against them.\n\nThe 20 mm shells are powerful for the ground-attack roles, with 53 mm of point-blank penetration with any belts loaded. A quick burst can destroy light pill-boxes in Air Realistic Battles, as well as penetrate some medium tanks via the weaker armour areas. Though the ground vehicles that the {{PAGENAME}} can encounter in Ground Realistic Battles are often more well armoured against the 20 mm power, modules can very easily be damaged with the Vulcan's rate of fire, let alone any shots towards the tank's roof armour.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers.

Finally the inclusion of [[Ballistic Computer|CCIP]] that assists in the usage of the aforementioned weaponry completes the A-7D as a deadly CAS package.\n\nBesides ground targets, the AGM-65A Maverick missiles can also be great for taking helicopters down in mixed ground battles.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Air battles\n\nWhen flying the A-7D in air realistic battles, the main challenge can be getting to bases or ground targets as most of the fight revolves around the centre of the map. To counter this, take some time to fly and possibly climb away from the map center where radar-equipped planes may be searching.\nOnce you've made it to the side, look at your surroundings and determine which group of targets/bombing base will net you the most rewards with as little risk of being shot down as possible. The moment you've expended your ordnance, you have two options - stay and fight other jet fighters or go back to the airfield to rearm and repair. These two options have their risks and benefits:\n\n* By staying, you open the chance to shoot down an enemy aircraft and grab yourself a large reward, but you also put yourself up as an easy target as the A-7D isn't designed to fight air targets primarily.\n* By returning to the base, you get the chance to repair any damage to your plane and get more ordnance to go back and attack more ground targets. One disadvantage is that your teammates may be stuck along in an unfair fight without your assistance.\n\n;Ground battles\n\nIn ground realistic battles, the A-7D is simultaneously a flying whale and a flying tank killer.\n\nThis aspect comes from that your attacker isn't very manoeuvrable. Still, the huge ordnance options allow you to take full advantage of the long flying periods that result from the large payloads and a large number of countermeasures.\n\nYou want to be aware of your surroundings and of any dangerous SPAA that may be an active mid-battle. Listen to your RWR, and visually check if any tracers or missiles may be headed your way. If you receive a lock warning take evasive manoeuvres and wait till the SPAA is taken out or that you get another chance to sneak up on the target to take them out.\n\n;;AGM-65 / Rockets\n\nYour AGMs and rockets can be your best luck at speedy attacks that require less time on attack slope that leave you as a sitting duck compared to bomb dropping. With the missiles, you can attain lock and quickly fire, then pull away to make sure you are in a safe position to reset and go in for another missile attack.\n\nYou can saturate an area with a huge number of rockets with rockets quickly from just about any altitude. If you have the weapon selection tool active, you can change the number of rockets fired at once, which can be very useful when you have to take out a single target with as little time in the combat area.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It was procured by the USAF due to the urging of the US Army, which wanted a subsonic aircraft to carry out close air support (CAS) missions for its ground forces. <ref>https://www.mdairmuseum.org/a-7d-corsair-ii</ref>\n\nThe A-7D had a number of differences from the earlier Navy Corsairs, due to different requirements by the Air Force. The TF-30 engine was replaced by a version of the Rolls-Royce Spey, called the TF-41. The TF-41-A1 version was used in the A-7D, producing 14,250 pounds of thrust. The two 20 mm cannons of the earlier Corsair IIs were replaced by the M61A1 rotary cannon. The avionics suite of the A-7D was also different from that of the earlier models; the AN/ASN-91 Central Computer was the centerpiece of the navigation and weaponry delivery system, which also featured the AN/APQ-126 radar, AN/AVQ-7 heads-up display, projected map display system, doppler radar, inertial navigation system, and a weapons control system.\n\nSome aspects of the A-7D made it unique from all Navy variants of the Corsair II. It had a boom and receptacle in-flight refueling system, improved wheels, tires, and brakes, an ESCAPAC IC ejection system, and a new oxygen system. The US Navy A-7E shared many characteristics with the A-7, but these changes listed never made it to USN Corsair IIs. <ref>https://www.vought.org/products/html/a-7d.html</ref>\n\nA total of 459 A-7Ds were built, with deliveries starting to the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing in 1970. Starting in 1972, the Air Force's 354th Tactical Fighter Wing operated A-7Ds from Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand during the late stages of the Vietnam War. Four USAF A-7Ds were lost in combat and two more were lost to other causes during that conflict, with a total of 12,928 combat sorties. Towards the end of the Vietnam War, A-7Ds from Korat Royal Thai AIr Force Base saw combat over Cambodia against the Khmer Rouge in support of the Lon Nol government. The last combat mission in Cambodia by an A-7D occurred on 15 August 1973.\n\nStarting in 1973, A-7Ds began to be allocated to the Air National Guard (ANG). ANG A-7Ds flew 34 combat sorties during the 1989 Operation Just Cause in Panama. The A-7D was fully retired in the early 1990s, having been replaced by the A-10 Thunderbolt, which first entered service in 1977.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6973-development-a-7d-corsair-ii-bulk-delivery-en|Devblog]] ===\nIn the early 1960s, the US Navy sought to procure a new naval strike aircraft in order to replace the A-4 Skyhawk. However, to ensure a fast development and reduce costs, the new machine was supposed to be based on aircraft already in service with the USN at the time. One of the aircraft manufacturers taking part in the competition - Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) - quickly developed an aircraft on the basis of their F-8 Crusader by shrinking the dimensions of the new aircraft and taking away its supersonic abilities in an effort to further save on costs.\n\nThe decision to do this was met with success as LTV's design was quickly declared the winner of the competition and given the official designation A-7 and named 'Corsair II', signaling the lineage from the older WWII-era fighter bomber F4U Corsair (also built by Vought). The aircraft undertook its maiden flight in September 1965, with serial production starting in 1966. In the first production batch, close to 200 A-7A Corsair IIs were built with many seeing action in the ongoing Vietnam War.\n\nDriven by the need to acquire a new strike aircraft themselves, and encouraged by the successes achieved by the A-7 in Vietnam, the USAF ordered the development of a separate Army variant in 1968, which would become the A-7D. Apart from vastly improved avionics, the A-7D also featured a more powerful engine and an M61 Vulcan cannon instead of two single-barreled 20 mm cannons.\n\nThe A-7D entered production in 1968 and continued rolling off the assembly line until 1975 with over 450 units being produced. It served until the early 1990s before being retired from active service.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a_7d Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"A-7D Corsair II Devblog Images\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:A-7D WTWallpaper 001.jpg|\nFile:A-7D WTWallpaper 002.jpg|\nFile:A-7D WTWallpaper 003.jpg|\nFile:A-7D WTWallpaper 004.jpg|\nFile:A-7D WTWallpaper 005.jpg|\nFile:A-7D WTWallpaper 006.jpg|\nFile:A-7D WTWallpaper 007.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|7J6c4D5MVRg|'''The Shooting Range #235''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:28 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6973-development-a-7d-corsair-ii-bulk-delivery-en|[Devblog] A-7D Corsair II: Bulk Delivery]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/510140-a-7d-corsair-ii/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== References ===\n\n;Citations\n<references />\n\n;Bibliography\n\n* A-7D Corsair II.
