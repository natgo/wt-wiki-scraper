It was introduced in [[Update \"Ground Breaking\"]]. The A-7E Corsair II is among the most capable ground attack aircraft in the game, sporting a variety of air-to-ground payloads including large calibre rotary cannon pods, unguided bombs and rockets, and medium range guided bombs. Additionally, CCIP and CCRP can be used for accurate usage of unguided weaponry, while an optional FLIR pod grants night vision and thermal sights to easily spot targets. This supreme air-to-ground capability comes with a hefty price; the A-7E is strictly limited to that ground attack role, as it has very slow speed and poor manoeuvrability which leaves it basically helpless in air-to-air combat.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nGround RB is where the A-7E truly shines. Its poor flight performance and manoeuvrability is less of an issue due to a lessened fighter presence. In Ground RB, the A-7E's most potent weapon is the AGM-62A Walleye I ER guided bombs. These bombs can be dropped from more than five kilometers away and still reliably hit. Additionally, a FLIR pod can optionally be carried in place of one Walleye guided bomb. This pod grants night vision and thermal imaging capabilities, allowing for significantly easier location of enemy vehicles. When you first spawn in with the Walleyes, you must first gain some altitude. As the A-7E is very slow, it is essential that you enter the battlefield at higher altitudes (at least 5 kilometers) to ensure safety from enemy SAMs. Once you are at this altitude, locate targets using either the Walleye's own targeting sight or the FLIR pod. It is recommended to use the FLIR pod for this, as the Walleye's targeting sight uses very dark colors which make enemy tanks hard to distinguish from other objects such as rocks. Ideally, you will be high enough that SAMs cannot reach, so you can focus mainly on locating targets. Once you find an enemy, simply lock on to them with the bomb, go into a small dive to position yourself, and drop the bomb. Once this happens, pull up and regain your lost altitude quickly to get out of range of SAMs. You don't need to worry about the dropped bomb as it is fire-and-forget (no additional input is needed once it's dropped). Continue this until you run out of bombs; when this happens you can either use your gun and AIM-9s for air defense, or to go back to base and rearm.\n\nIn Air RB, the A-7E is unfortunately extremely outclassed. Its potent ground attack capabilities offer minimal advantages in Air RB, and you are left only with its poor flight performance and bad manoeuvrability. Your best bet will be to attack ground targets in Air RB using your cannon. Don't try bombing bases as you are simply too slow; either other planes will get to the bases first, or the enemy will get to you first. \n\nIf you do want to attempt air combat in air RB, the A-7E does also have the ability to carry AIM-9G missiles, which can be used in conjunction with the potent cannon against distracted enemy fighters. Additionally, either 20mm M61 or 30mm GAU-13/A rotary cannons can be equipped for devastating frontal firepower, though this decreases overall speed and manoeuvrability. One can make use of the A-7s reputation of being poor at air combat to bait people into head-ons (especially if gun pods are equipped), though this strategy is defeated if the enemy chooses to simply go up to simultaneously avoid your guns and energy trap you. The large quantity of countermeasures may improve survivability somewhat, but the poor manoeuvrability means if there is an enemy fighter on your tail trying to kill you with guns, you probably won’t be able to shake them off and survive. Overall, for air combat in Air RB, the A-7E will always be severely limited by it’s poor flight performance and manoeuvrability, and this sees that you simply won’t be doing much other than taking all head-ons or getting lucky kills. \n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The A-7E is a navalized version of the A-7D, with the incorporation of an arrestor hook and gear, as well as modifying the wings to allow them to be folded. It also got its radar upgraded to a newer AN/APN-190 navigational radar, and saw the addition of an AN/APQ-128 terrain following one. As for the weapon loadout, it used different kind of missiles, like the AGM-84E SLAM, AGM-88 HARM, AGM-65F Maverick, between others.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a_7e Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|OuL1L0FhblE|'''The Shooting Range #277''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:29 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vought}}\n{{USA jet aircraft}}"}}
