It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]].\n\nThe A32A \"Lansen\" was designed and developed by the Swedish company SAAB. The development began in 1948 and it first flew in 1952. Deliveries to the Swedish air force, Flygvapnet, began in 1954. In Flygvapnet it was used as a ground-attack aircraft, being able to carry a large array of different bombs and unguided rockets as well as four 20 mm Akan m/49 canons. It remained in service until 1978 but never saw use in combat. Powered by a license-built Rolls Royce Avon engine, locally designated the RM5, it was able to break the speed of sound in a dive, thus becoming the first Swedish aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIn Air Realistic Battles, the A32A can make very effective use of its available bombs. The 3 x [[Mb m/50 (600 kg)|600 kg m/50 bombs]] deliver 480 kg of explosive mass each, which is more than enough to destroy a base at its tier. Though having mediocre acceleration, the aircraft has sufficient speed to outrun any enemy attackers in the initial phase of the match, and can generally drop its bombs on at least one base, if sufficient at avoiding [[Su-7B|Su-7]]s and/or [[Harrier (Family)|Harrier]]s. From there onwards, it's recommended to either return to the airfield, or pick off targets using the tactic described below.\n\nAn alternative route is the traditional fighter route. The A32A has an attacker spawn, and as a result may pursue enemy attackers, including but not limited to [[AV-8A|AV-8 Harriers]], [[Yak-38]]s, [[Vautour IIA IDF/AF (France)|Vautour]] bombers, and the easiest target, the [[A-4E Early|A-4E]]. The aircraft has mediocre manoeuvrability compared to its tier, but has quite decent energy retention, and can be effective if used as a boom and zoom aircraft, maintaining speed as much as possible. Unlike the fighter variant, the [[J32B|J32]], the A32 does not have missiles. This makes it entirely reliant on 4 x 20 mm cannons, which are sufficient in taking down anything that they hit. Be warned, the cannons have a finnicky placement on the bottom of the aircraft, and take some getting used to. The elevator will also lock up at high speeds, which can be a problem.\n\nIt is recommended to keep or bring all dogfights at lower altitudes. The A32A performs best relative to other aircraft closer to the deck. When spaded, the aircraft has enough manoeuvrability to allow a decent pilot to reverse pursuing hostiles and score victories.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Good climb rate\n* Fast top speed\n* Has 4 powerful nose-mounted cannons with high rate of fire, giving good one-second burst mass\n* Good roll rate\n* Fowler flap design provides excellent lift at low speeds\n* Has a wide range of bombs and rockets loadouts, beneficial in tank RB\n* Has decent pilot protection & airframe endurance\n* Radar warning receiver\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Mediocre manoeuvrability, almost every opponent it faces can outmanoeuvre it\n* Very inefficient airbrake design that requires high angle-of-attack or aggressive banking to slow down\n* Large target making it easy to get hit\n* Can be difficult to land as landing flaps rip above 300 km/h\n* Slow acceleration\n* Cannons do not have great damage output, requiring aim\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Designed to replace the obsolete propeller-powered Saab 18, the aircraft's design was influenced by late-war German aircraft designs such as the P. 1101, P.1110, P.1111 and P.1112. The aircraft featured a conventional low-mounted swept-wing with a sleek fuselage housing a two-man crew, while the later J 32 fighter variant had a single crewmember. The A32A was introduced in 1955 with a total of 287 aircraft built for the attack role, serving until the end of the 1970s.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War, the primary Swedish ground-attack aircraft was the obsolete Saab 18, a propeller-driven aircraft initially designed in the late 1930s. The initial design was influenced by late-war German aircraft designs such as the P. 1101, P.1110, P.1111 and P.1112, whose blueprints were given to Saab by former Messerschmitt engineers who fled to Switzerland. Among these engineers was Hermann Behrbohm, who would become a key contributor to the Saab 29, 32 and J 35 programs.\n\nIn terms of design, the A32A had a sleek fuselage with a low-mounted wing swept 35 degrees. The aircraft was powered by a Svenska Flygmotor RM5, which was a license-produced version of the Rolls-Royce Avon jet engine. This engine provided the A 32A with a thrust-to-weight ratio of ~0.3, while the later J32B fighter featured a heavily-upgraded RM6 engine producing significantly-more thrust. From the outset, the A32A was designed to house significant amounts of electronic warfare and weapons systems. The aircraft carried four 20 mm Oerlikon aircraft cannons in the nose, and could be fitted with unguided weapons including rockets and bombs up to 600 kg. The A32A could also carry two Rb 04 anti-ship missiles, one of the first cruise missiles to enter service.\n\nIn total, 287 A32A Lansens were produced for the Swedish Air Force between 1955 and 1957, replacing the Saab 18. The aircraft proved to be fairly reliable in service in terms of both aircraft and weapons systems. Additionally, the A32A was intended to carry nuclear weapons as part of Sweden's nuclear program; these plans were shelved with the end of Sweden's nuclear program. The A32A was Sweden's last dedicated ground-attack aircraft; the last airframes were phased out in the 1970s in favour of the AJ 37 Viggen.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=saab_a32a Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"150\">\nImage:A32A over the sea!.jpg|<small>A32A</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|s6mS74VckHw|'''Nothing To OFFER!
