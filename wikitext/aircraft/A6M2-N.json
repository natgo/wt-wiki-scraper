It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nAlbeit generally worse than the \"normal\" Zeroes, the A6M2-N still retains good climb rate, acceleration and manoeuvrability. It suffers from bad performance at higher altitudes, but that is rarely a problem for this plane, as high altitude engagements are rare at its battle rating. It also has good armament for such a low battle rating: two 20 mm Type 99 Mod 1 cannons and two 7.7 mm Type 97 machine guns. Although powerful, the guns have low shell velocity, so you should lead your target more than you think. Also, the ammo count is quite low, and the aircraft has no armour or self-sealing fuel tanks, so it is best to avoid taking too many hits, as you will probably start burning from the first 7.5 mm machine gun bullet. The aircraft is designed to land on water, though like all other seaplanes, with enough care, one can land it on airfields.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nThe A6M2-N has no armor protection, and the fuel tanks are not self-sealing. Most major modules are located in the nose and wing roots of the plane, but there is also a fuel tank in the center pontoon. This means the pilot and major modules have very little protection, although from the front the engine can absorb shots before the injure the pilot. The pontoons are very large, and can absorb fire from surface targets (ships, SPAAGs, machine guns) or even a plane at a lower altitude. Most fuel is located in the center pontoon, so be careful not to lose that pontoon or else you will not have much more flying time.\n\n* No Armor Protection\n* Not Self-Sealing Fuel Tanks\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nGrinding the A6M2-N will be depending what game modes that you play frequently. If it is Realistic or Simulator battles, it is best to focus on aircraft performance as you will be engaged in frequent manoeuvring engagements. In Arcade battles, it's better to focus on firepower as most of the time you will get into head-on attacks against other players.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Defensive Play'''\n\nThis play style is a common theme among all Japanese Zeroes, due to the fact that playing aggressive and going for head on attacks is not an option (no armour + wood frame + no self sealing tanks = fires!). In saying that, you want to stick to tactics that are purely defensive and only attack when someone attacks you and not vice-versa. If you do think you can attack, make sure that the enemy is within 1 km of you (2 km max). Once engaged you are in that fight till the end but if the fight goes sour, remember to turn in defensive manners and only manoeuvre in manners that will keep you safe and leave the chaser in a disadvantage where he has to or is forced into a recovery manoeuvre to keep up with you. But because you're a float plane, it's going to be a bit hard trying to turn so speed is everything, but luckily due to the weight being below the plane, downward turns are fast and quick but be warned... the neck of the main float has a oil cooler and the float itself has a massive fuel tank, so be more careful than you would be in a normal Zero.\n\n* In Simulator, the A6M Zero is overall a great plane to fly. Its advantages include the extremely smooth handling, impressive turn rate despite having extra floats, low stall speed, the ability to not enter spins in extreme manoeuvres, and decent rear visibility. It is able to pull really tight turns or barrel rolls without losing control or going into a spin, allowing the player to use this stability to their advantage. Its disadvantages, however, are the fragile protection, wing-mounted guns with very little ammo, and the cockpit scattered with frames. Although not thick, these frames can still be obstructions in a fight. Also the gunsight is small and mounted very low, resulting in inadequate visibility over the nose. This can limit the player's ability to see the target in a turn fight since to lead the target, the player must cut inside its turn, meaning the nose will now block the target. The A6M can perform dogfighting, some ground pounding and some intercepting.\n* You can bring the minimum amount of fuel (29 minutes) since this model of the Zero only has a 60-round drum per cannon, as a result you might need to constantly return to airfield to reload so there is no need to bring more fuel. Set the convergence to 150-300 m. When taking off, the A6M will shift severely to the left so it is best to set separate keybind for left and right brakes to counter the torque.\n* For dogfighting, it is better to engage with an altitude advantage so climb to around 2,500 m. Track the opponent using lead or pure pursuit, as with lag pursuit you will eventually end up at the 6'o clock of the target aircraft whose fuselage will soak up most of your MG bullets, and your wing mounted cannons will become really awkward to aim. With the amazing stableness the aim should be easy. Target their wings or nose and avoid the back half of the fuselage as there is usually nothing in there. You can turn with most planes with your combat/takeoff flaps deployed. Note that it is best to fire in 5-round/half-second bursts to avoid wasting cannon rounds. Once the cannons are out, the leftover 7.7 mm MGs can only effectively damage single engine fighters.\n\n* For ground pounding with bombs, look for tanks and pillboxes. First you need some separation between you and the target so you have enough time to line-up the drop. Dive at the target at a rather shallow angle, and release the 60 kg bombs when you are very close, with the target below the gunsight and filling up around half of it. If you only use the MGs, your targets are trucks, AAA and howitzers. Dive at it and stabilise the plane so the gunsight stays overall still at the target. Then, once the target fills out around 1/6 of the gunsight, open fire. If your aim is accurate you can destroy one target in a single pass. However, it is very recommended to set keybind for firing MG only as you can definitely not waste the valuable cannon rounds. Save them for any unexpected dogfights.\n* Landing is easy thanks to the low stall speed and lovely handling. Line up and approach the airstrip at treetop, decrease speed to at most 210 km/h and deploy combat, takeoff and landing flaps in order. Further decelerate so the touchdown speed is no more than 180 km/h to avoid bouncing up.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n* I-16: the late I-16s are equipped with ShVAK cannons that can be pretty dangerous to your fragile airframe. They can turn equally well as the Zero, have superior roll rate but the stability is so terrible that as soon as they pull a little more on the stick, they will enter spins. Therefore it is quite easy to counter them: engage a turnfight with them and turn tighter and tighter, or do a few barrel rolls. They will quickly lose control and start spinning and it is quite hard to recover. Then simply get some separation, turn around and put some solid shots into them. They have an I-15's short and fat fuselage, a flat radial engine and triangular stabilisers located right after the low-mounted mono wings, all covered in olive green paint.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The A6M2 model 11, with non-folding wings, was chosen as a starting point. The landing gear was removed, and a large float with a built-in fuel tank installed in its place. A float was also installed under each wing for stability. The plane's armament was left unchanged.\n\nDespite the significantly increased aerodynamic resistance and weight, the plane was quite fast and manoeuvrable.\n\n327 of these aircraft were produced, including the original prototype, but the first A6M2-Ns barely ever took part in combat, since they were destroyed shortly after arriving at Tulagi (in the Solomon Islands) in an attack by U.S. B-17s from the 11th Bombardment Group.\n\nThey were used primarily as interceptors.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a6m2_n_zero Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n;Related development\n* Kawanishi [[N1K1]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* [[Ar 196 A-3]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/293771-nakajima-a6m2-n/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[Wikipedia:Nakajima_A6M2-N|[Wikipedia<nowiki>]</nowiki> Nakajima A6M2-N]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Nakajima}}\n{{Japan fighters}}"}}
