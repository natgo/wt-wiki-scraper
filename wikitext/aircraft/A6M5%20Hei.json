In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Ixwa Strike\"]]. The A6M5 Hei offers a good offensive armament as well as various payload options. The plane also has armour, granting better durability. It retains the good flight performance of the Zero family, with a turn time short enough to outmanoeuvre enemy fighters, although it can feel a little sluggish to players used to early variants. Pilots will generally notice a reduced rate of climb  and poor acceleration.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n[[File:A6M51.png|thumb|A6M5 Hei cruising at tree top level]]\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nDue to the weight of the armour protecting the pilot and the additional heavy machine guns, the climb rate of this plane is rather poor for its BR. The engine won't overheat under combat conditions. The A6M5 Hei can feel quite sluggish as it cannot turn as well as other planes in the A6M5 family. While the plane's turning ability is hampered by the extra weight, players will still be able to out-turn every other plane.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Realistic Battles\n\nIn Air RB, your primary focus is to engage fighters. Do not bring any payload options for this plane, as it will weigh you down significantly. Select 400 m for the gun convergence, use the Ground Targets belt for your 13 mm guns, and the Universal or Tracers belts for your 20 mm cannons. Climb at a 15° angle and you may want to try a slight side climb on smaller maps. Try climbing and staying with your team. You will be outclassed by many fighters, so play to your strengths. Engage targets that have low energy states, and try to dogfight them. Do not engage in head-ons or high altitude fighting and stay close to your allied aircraft, as the A6M5 hei works well when an enemy is overfocused on an allied plane. Try not to stall out in this plane, as your weight is increased and the relatively weak engine won't allow you to recover from stalls easily.\n\n;Arcade Battles\n\nIn Air Arcade, this plane is extremely versatile: it can engage enemy ground units with rockets, intercept bombers and hunt enemy fighters. Engage in turnfights to reduce your exposure to enemy fire and play with caution, as this plane is fragile.\n\n;Mixed Battles (Ground/Naval)\n\nIn mixed battles, the 250 kg bomb is your best option. You can fly extremely low to the ground thanks to the plane's superb manoeuvrability. Set a 1.5 second fuse on the bomb and drop it really close to the target. Once you have spent all ordnance, you can either take on fighter duties or return to the airfield and rearm.\n\n;[[File:A6M57.png|thumb|A6M5 Hei from a scenic view]]Specific enemies worth noting\n\n* P-51 (Family): as always, anything with 0.50 cal Brownings is a threat to the A6M5 hei. These planes will always try to boom and zoom and light you an fire. These planes will usually have an altitude advantage, thanks to their amazing climb rate. To engage these fighters, make sure you have a good speed and room to dodge attacks. Try to bait a P-51 to lower altitudes or close to friendly fighters. The best way to kill an energy fighter is when it is low and slow.\n* Bf 109 (Family): this planes' superb climb and energy retention allow them to make multiple boom and zoom attacks on you. Dodge these by making evasive loops to throw off the pilot and make them overshoot. Do not engage in head-ons with a Bf 109.\n* XP-55: the XP-55 outperforms you in every way possible. Play smart when facing these planes, and stick with your team.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The propeller pitch should be kept at 95% at all times. The radiators both should be kept between 5 and 15% depending if you are on a hot or cold map. The second supercharger gear should be activated at 3,500 m and above.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Furthermore Japan was in a situation where no replacement for the outdated Zero had been found yet, with the aircraft that have been designed as replacements continuously suffered setbacks and engine deficits while the war situation continued to worsen for Japan.\n\nFaced with the increasing threat of American high-altitude bombing raids, Japanese engineers had little choice but to further modify the A6M, despite knowing it was vastly inferior to the latest aircraft flown by the Allies. As a result, in September 1944, Mitsubishi rolled out the A6M5 Hei; a modification of the late war 'Zero' design, but outfitted with a stronger weapons arsenal, including an expanded range of secondary weapons the aircraft could carry.\n\nTests of the aircraft revealed substantially degraded performance characteristics over previous variants due to weight increases. As fitting the aircraft with a different, more powerful engine, wasn't possible, the A6M5 Hei was accepted into service nonetheless, despite its worse performance. However, as the A6M5 Hei entered production in the last stages of WWII, its production numbers remained low, chiefly due to the decreasing Japanese industrial capacity in the final months of the war. In total, over 90 units of the A6M5 Hei were produced by Mitsubishi alone by the end of WWII, with no available production data from Nakajima.\n\n''-From [https://warthunder.com/en/news/7072-development-a6m5-hei-the-up-gunned-samurai-en Devblog]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a6m5hei Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:A6M5 Hei WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:A6M5 Hei WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:A6M5 Hei WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:A6M5 Hei WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:A6M5 Hei WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:A6M5 Hei WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7072-development-a6m5-hei-the-up-gunned-samurai-en|[Devblog] A6M5 Hei: The Up-Gunned Samurai]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mitsubishi}}\n{{Japan fighters}}"}}
