In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.37]]. The {{PAGENAME}} is an exact copy of the German [[He 112 B-0]], which were sent to Japan by the Luftwaffe.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nThe A7He1 has no armour protection, but the fuel tanks are self-sealing. All the major modules are located in the nose and wing roots of the plane. This means the pilot and major modules have very little protection, although from the front the engine can absorb shots before they injure the pilot.\n\n* No armour protection\n* Self-sealing fuel tanks\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|MG FF (20 mm)|MG 17 (7.92 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 2 x 20 mm MG FF cannons, wing-mounted (60 rpg = 120 total)\n* 2 x 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe offensive weapons are equal to the [[Bf 109 E-3]] with one exception: the nose-mounted machine guns have half the ammo. While this seems to be a drawback for the He 112/A7He1, it really is not. With 500 rounds per gun, the Heinkel will not run out of ammo any time soon.\n\nThe 7.92 mm MG 17s major advantage comes in handy for adjusting shots at long range. The 7.92 mm bullet has better bullet ballistics than the 20 mm MG FF, but they can still be used for predicting the bullet drop of the 20 mm cannon shells. Keep in mind that the MG 17's successor, the 13 mm MG 131, has the same ballistics as the MG 17; a decision deliberately made in real life to allow pilots to immediately use the new MG without having to adjust for a change bullet behaviour.\n\nOn paper, the A7He1 appears to be quite well armed, having two machine guns and two MG FF cannons. However, the cannons are quite underwhelming, especially with the Air targets belt. Many of the belts' rounds seem to explode on the surface of enemy aircraft, damaging external features such as control surfaces, but doing very little internal damage. Sometimes, multiple hits can be placed on an aircraft with little or no effect. It is recommended to aim for control surfaces, particularly ailerons and elevators on the wings and tail. This means that if an aircraft can't be knocked out of the sky via firepower, it can be forced to crash due to loss of control.\n\nThe A7He1 can perform well in naval battles, especially Naval RB. Compared to other early German and Japanese aircraft which only have poor-penetrating 7.92/7.7mm machine guns, the A7He1 has two powerful cannons which can deal a lot of damage, especially to small boats. It is recommended to use stealth belt in this role, as this belt has lots of APHE rounds.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nAs the [[He 112 (Family)|He 112]] was being phased out of German service in favour of the [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109]], the Germans started considering exporting the design. The first nation placing an order was Japan, who ordered 30 [[He 112 B-0]] to be used on the Chinese front by the Navy. The Japanese Naval designation for the He 112 B-0 was '''A7He1''' (A7 Heinkel 1), as the A6M Zero was still in tweaking stage.\n\nAs the first 12 He 112 B-0 arrived, the Navy started comparing their new purchase with some of their own designs. The main comparison was the '''A7He1''' vs [[A5M4|A5M]]. From test results, they concluded that the A7He1 was quite the speed demon compared to the A5M but lacked manoeuvrability and climbing speed. Due this, the Navy scrapped the plan for frontline usage of the A7He1 and used them instead for training and teaching purposes. The planes were also studied to research the wing design, engine, landing gear and auxiliary technology. In addition, a single A7He1 was passed down to the Second Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo Imperial University for further research.\n\nThe remaining order of He 112 B-0 was cancelled due to delays and the design being considered inferior to domestic Japanese plane design as well as being too deviant from the IJN's fighter doctrine. The He 112 B-0s of the order remaining in Germany were diverted to the Condor Legion to fight in the Spanish Civil War instead.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a7he1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;[[He 112 (Family)|Related development]]\n* [[He 112 B-0]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/71218-heinkel-he-112-b-0b1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Heinkel}}\n{{Japan fighters}}\n{{Japan premium aircraft}}"}}
