It was introduced in [[Update 1.53 \"Firestorm\"]].\n\nThe A7M1 Reppu is the prototype version of the A7M2 in the tech tree fitted with a NK9H engine. In game this fighter is a jack of all trades - excellent energy retention, amazing turn rate, and acceptable  speed. These traits make the Reppu an excellent weapon for players who enjoy being the tip of the spear.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe A7M1 ''Reppu'' is a relatively heavy plane but still performs very similar to an [[A6M (Family)|A6M ''Zero'']] with the increased performance thanks to its high output engine. This engine however won't be the best outfitted on the A7M platform and a better can be found in the tech tree as the [[A7M2]] which boasts a Ha-43 engine with 200 hp extra.\n\nThe A7M1 that takes the best of the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]] and does it better also translates it in aerial combat. With its higher output, very similar manoeuvrability and higher rip-speeds, it can engage in all playstyles; whether the situation calls for it the A7M can either turn fight, Boom-&-Zoom, energy fight and others. Yet even with its NK9H engine, it is sometimes tricky to maintaining energy fights with enemies like the [[F6F-5]], [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]], etc.\n\nThe main focus of the A7M1 is a naval fighter, solidified by its only ordnance of 2 x 60 kg that only destroy vehicles at this rank with a direct hit. However, its strong armament of 13 mm and 20 mm machineguns makes it a hard-hitting fighter on most less-protected roof armours (<20 mm).\n\n===Tactics===\n;;Low altitude fighting\n\nThis is where the {{PAGENAME}} shines and players familiar with the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]] will feel right at home and. Newer players will become familiar with its playstyle quite easily due its better performance and more forgiving yet punchier gun-choice with plenty of ammo to spare.\n\nOnly couple of planes like Spitfires can be a challenging opponent at low altitudes, mainly because most planes will lose energy when fighting with the A7M1 at low altitudes when the A7M1 is able to outturn and be on their tail in couple seconds. The 13 mm and 20 mm armaments combined are very deadly and will tear down a plane in a good placed burst. Aim for center of mass when turn fighting, and tail when tailing, especially the elevators.\n\n;;High altitude fighting\n\nTurn fighting at high altitude is rather difficult since, the higher you go, the less air pressure there is. This means there will be less air to lift your plane when doing a hard turn compared to sea level, meaning the A7M1 will not be able to turn as fast as you do at sea level. This should be taken into consideration since most of the planes at high altitudes (4+ km) often have superchargers or turbochargers ([[Wyvern S4]] for example) and will make an easy prey out of you, as you do not maintain the same energy nor speed they maintain.\n\n;;Bomber Interception\n\nThe drawbacks from high altitude does not stop the A7M1 from fighting in the clouds. One of the easiest targets for the A7M1 are bombers. They are big, have big wingspans and are often slow (unless they are dive bombers or strike fighters). They can be easily destroyed with the 13 mm and 20 mm armaments due to their sheer calibre and destructive ammunition. When engaging a bomber, aim for the engines or wings. With the right belts equipped, a few well placed shots the bombers will catch fire or even shred the wings.\n\nBe careful when engaging bigger preys as they might turn into a predator if handled wrongly. Hit fast and hard, put bullets into the cockpit or make short work of their wings. Do not tail it, most bombers will shred the A7M badly and a fire is most guaranteed, which the A7M won't last long through.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This singular plane would be the first A7M and respectively would become the [[A7M1 (NK9H)|A7M1]] and a trial flight would be performed on the 6th of May, 1944.\n\nWhile the wingload was acceptable of 150 kg/m², manoeuvrability and handling were excellent but the engine was simply underpowered and couldn't meet the speed requirements the Navy were looking for and ended up in a disappointed cancel of the project.\n\nBut as Mitsubishi already got a greenlight to use Mitsubishi's home-made engine with the MK9 beforehand, the project sparked interest once more for the Navy with the [[A7M2#History|A7M2]].\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a7m1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[A7M2]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/272050-mitsubishi-a7m1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mitsubishi}}\n{{Japan fighters}}\n{{Japan premium aircraft}}"}}
