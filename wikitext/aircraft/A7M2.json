The Reppu is an overall smooth operator at most altitudes thanks to its decent acceleration, vastly improved speed and decent manoeuvrability. Less manoeverable than the Zero, it can at certain times really struggle in dogfights, the rudder has a want to fight you at every turn requiring forceful control and slight damage to the airframe negates most of its ability to dogfight anything but the slowest turners effectively. The most noteworthy change is the replacement of the underpowered Nakajima Sakae Radial engine with a significantly more powerful Mitsubishi Ha-43 Radial. This new engine propels the Reppu to higher speeds previously unobtainable by the Zero and turns this aircraft from a nuisance to a universally feared opponent.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,660 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Anything with greater than .50 calibre weapons will be able to take off a wing or worse. The wingspan has also increased significantly to keep the manoeuvrability of the Zero while supporting increased weight added from the guns, engine and other updates. A downside is that this makes the wings easier to hit. However, The manoeuvrability of the Reppu allows this aircraft to avoid most damage if you can keep turning.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:A7M2steepclimb.png|thumb|A7M2 in a steep climb]]\n\nThe A7M2 ''Reppu'' that takes the best of the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]] and does it better also translates it in aerial combat. With its higher engine output, very similar manoeuvrability and higher rip-speeds, it can engage in all playstyles; whether the situation calls for it the A7M can either turn fight, Boom-&-Zoom, energy fight and others. Yet it is sometimes tricky to maintaining energy fights with enemies like the [[F6F-5]], [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]], etc.\n\n===Tactics===\n\n;;Ground pounding\n\nWhile Japan isn't exactly a nation that has a lot of ground pounding capacity with the mainstay theatre being the Pacific, the A7M2 is the lowest battle rating Japanese plane that boasts heavy rockets that can destroy the heaviest of ground targets. Together with the fact they are fired separately, 2 kills are easy with proper aiming.\n\nAlong with the rockets, it boasts 13.2 mm & 20 mm guns on a very manoeuvrable platform making it very easy to just stay close to ground level, re-adjusting on target and diving in on vehicle roofs and blasting engines & turret crew.\n\n;;Low altitude fighting\n\nThis is where the {{PAGENAME}} shines and players familiar with the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]] will feel right at home. Newer players will become familiar with its playstyle quite easily due its better performance and more forgiving yet punchier gun-choice with plenty of ammo to spare.\n\nOnly couple of planes like Spitfires can be a challenging opponent at low altitudes, mainly because most planes will lose energy when fighting with the A7M2 at low altitudes when the A7M2 is able to outturn and be on their tail in couple seconds. The 13 mm and 20 mm armaments combined are very deadly and will tear down a plane in a good placed burst. Aim for center of mass when turn fighting, and tail when tailing, especially the elevators.\n\n;;High altitude fighting\n\nTurn fighting at high altitude is rather difficult since, the higher you go, the less air density there is. This means there will be less air to lift your plane when doing a hard turn compared to sea level, meaning the A7M2 will not be able to turn as fast as you do at sea level. This should be taken into consideration since most of the planes at high altitudes (4+ km) often have superchargers or turbochargers ([[Wyvern S4]] for example) and will make an easy prey out of you, as you do not maintain the same energy nor speed they maintain.\n\n;;Bomber Interception\n\nThe drawbacks from high altitude does not stop the A7M1 from fighting in the clouds. One of the easiest targets for the A7M2 are bombers. They are big, have big wingspans and are often slow (unless they are dive bombers or strike fighters). They can be easily destroyed with the 13 mm and 20 mm armaments due to their sheer calibre and destructive ammunition. When engaging a bomber, aim for the engines or wings. With the right belts equipped, a few well placed shots will set them afire or even shred the wings.\n\nBe careful when engaging bigger preys as they might turn into a predator if handled wrongly. Hit fast and hard, put bullets into the cockpit or make short work of their wings. Do not tail it, most bombers will shred the '''A7M''' badly and a fire is most guaranteed, which the '''A7M''' won't last long through.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

As the aging A6M doesn't compare to the A7M2, the Navy cancelled the formal cancelation of the A7M project and adopted the A7M2 as their new main carrier-based fighter.\n\nIn late 1944 an earthquake strained the manufacturing of the A7M2 causing only 8 to be built. In early 1945, Allied bombings of Japans mainland lead to the destruction of the A7M plans. This ceased the whole development of the A7M2 and the plane would never see combat.\n\nOnly a single A7M2 would be built in 1945 due to allied bombings and none remain surviving WWII.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=a7m2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n{{Skin-gallery |market|ugcitem_1000533|A7M2 352nd kokutai.png|Camo \"352nd Kokutai\"}}\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|PNkoJ-MFERc|'''Best naval fighters''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:45 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|Fjh-tTr6TPs|'''Best Combo #2'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 0:30  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/285026-mitsubishi-a7m2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mitsubishi}}\n{{Japan fighters}}"}}
