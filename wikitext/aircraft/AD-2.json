In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 \"Weapons of Victory\"]].\n\nThe Skyraider is one of the most iconic propeller-driven ground attack aircraft of the Korean and Vietnam wars. Likewise, its armament certainly lives up to that. Even early on, the 12 HVARs you have can be devastating when used against light pillboxes and medium tanks, quickly turning a very tidy profit with a total of 8 possible launches. Generally your job is to inflict as much damage on the enemy tickets as possible, through pillboxes, ships and tanks.\n\nThe AD-2 Skyraider is a high rank American monoplane strike aircraft with a perfect combination of flight performance and payload. It has decent performance and guns, and can carry a massive payload of well over 4,000 lb of equipment, including rockets, bombs, and torpedoes. The Skyraider has a far forward cockpit, improving visibility and an airbrake capable enough of dealing with steep dives for maximum time on target.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nWhen used in all battle modes, be sure to steer clear of enemy fighters, pick the ground targets that are farthest away from the usual dogfight zones, for example, the far left base on Alternate History Krysmk has plenty of targets and is seldom visited by Soviet aircraft. One of the first weapon modifications you can unlock are torpedoes, a weapon which while seldom used, can turn a very quick profit when aiming for a light cruiser, destroyer or a Japanese aircraft carrier (as British and American ones are far more difficult to sink). With that, you can quickly grind down the payload line until you can carry your maximum ordnance. Once fully upgraded, choose your payload based on your skills in bombing and rockets. If you find you're better at rockets, load Tiny Tims and aim for heavy targets once your HVARs are used. Otherwise load up the 3,000 lbs of bombs and obliterate any position you feel.\n\n=== Counter-tactics ===\n<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->\nThe Skyraiders have a surprising level of manoeuvrability when they are clean of their ordnance. When engaging keep your energy at all cost, because if that AD dumps his load, all he has to do is drain you of your ability to run to be able to gain the advantage and take you out.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nThe piston-engine Skyraider was designed during World War II to meet United States Navy requirements for a carrier-based, single-seat, long-range, high-performance dive/torpedo bomber. It was equipped with the 2,700 HP Wright 3350 Duplex-Cyclone Engine, the same engine that equipped to the B-29 Superfortress Bomber. It was designed to replace the Helldiver and the Avenger torpedo bombers as the Navy's primary attack craft. Unfortunately, it didn't serve in WWII due to the program being delayed. It went on to serve with distinction in later wars such as Korea and Vietnam.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=douglas_ad_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|qQjxB7WRaJg|'''The Shooting Range #185''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:10 discusses the Douglas Skyraider.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* Douglas [[A2D-1|A2D]] ''Skyshark''\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* Aichi [[B7A2|B7A]]\n* Martin [[AM-1|AM]] ''Mauler''\n* Westland [[Wyvern S4|Wyvern]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/234546-douglas-ad-2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [https://www.historynet.com/able-dog-was-the-ad-skyraider-the-best-attack-bomber-ever-built.htm [History Net<nowiki>]</nowiki> Able Dog: Was the AD Skyraider the Best Attack Bomber Ever Built?] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210418234140/https://www.historynet.com/able-dog-was-the-ad-skyraider-the-best-attack-bomber-ever-built.htm Web Archive])\n* [https://www.boeing.com/history/products/ad-a-1-skyraider-bomber.page [Boeing<nowiki>]</nowiki> AD/A-1 SKYRAIDER ATTACK BOMBER] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210418234204/https://www.boeing.com/history/products/ad-a-1-skyraider-bomber.page Web Archive])\n* [https://www.airvectors.net/ava1spad.html [Air Vectors<nowiki>]</nowiki> The Douglas AD / A-1 Skyraider] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210418234200/https://www.airvectors.net/ava1spad.html Web Archive])\n\n{{AirManufacturer Douglas}}\n{{USA strike aircraft}}"}}
