In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]].\n\nThe AD-4 is a thorough-bred ground attacker. It can be armed with a slew of deadly anti-ground weaponry ranging from several high payload bombs and HVAR rockets to a massive 56 Mighty Mouse rockets capable of pinpoint precision and deadly effect. Though lacking in flight performance, the AD-4's armament allows the pilot to annihilate anything that ends up in front of his guns; destroying enemy planes in very few hits and being able to destroy even light pillboxes and light tanks with the right ammunition. If there are ground targets to be destroyed, the American tree can offer no better attacker aircraft.\n\nThe AD-4 is generally a sluggish aircraft, which should come to no surprise considering the engine output and weight of the aircraft. In sustained horizontal turn fights and all energy fights, the AD-4 will be out-manoeuvred quickly. Whilst it has speed, the AD-4 has a surprisingly high turn rate, though the high weight causes energy retention to be perhaps one of the worst of any aircraft in War Thunder.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nConsidering the size, weight, and engine of the aircraft, the AD-4 still maintains a good top-end speed and gets there in a reasonable time, though nowhere as fast as comparable fighters get to theirs. Skyraider pilots will find their plane able pull a great instantaneous turn rate to keep up with fighters or other aircraft that end up on the business end of the AD-4's cannons, though their plane will very quickly lose a lot of speed thanks to its incredibly high weight. Sustained turns are not a strength of the AD-4 by any means, and the introduction of any verticality into manoeuvres will emphasis this weakness even further; the plane has rather terrible energy retention.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,822 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

This makes it the obvious and only choice for grinding with the AD-4 in Air.\n\n;;Ground\n\n# Research ''TC mk.I'' to open up the path to MBC mk.I.\n# Then research ''Compressor'' for the extra engine power.\n# With tier 3 open, research ''MBC mk.I'', then ''Engine'' and ''New 20 mm cannons''. <br>\n# Finally, with tier 4 open, research ''LBC mk.I''. <br>\n\nFFARs may be accurate, but their post-penetration damage versus ground forces vehicles is pathetic. The large 2,000 lb and 1,000 lb bombs available to the AD-4 are much more reliable at destroying in general, and HVARs have far superior destruction power when they hit.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:AttackerImage_AD4-SPM-SKIN-SRGB100.jpg|250px|thumb|right|AD-4 Skyraider, Performing ground attack role.]]\nIn an air match, you need to know where the most important targets are and immediately make a beeline for them. Using your weight and air-spawn, you can reach a relatively high speed for your airframe of 500 - 600 km/h in an extended shallow dive. Once at the objective area, your mission is to destroy as many vehicles that contribute to your team's victory as possible before enemy interceptors reach you. If possible, use your FFAR rocket payload, as they are incredibly accurate and are able to destroy light pillboxes and all ground vehicles in one direct hit. You can also use your AN/M3 cannons' API-T rounds to penetrate and destroy light pillboxes and light tanks. If this is your goal, use the ''Universal'' ammo belt if unlocked, as it means every other round is API-T. ''Ground targets'' use two API-T, then a HE-T and a P round, so it is not as effective versus aircraft while being no more effective against ground targets than ''Universal''.\n\n====Specific enemies worth noting====\n<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->\nALL fighter aircraft have a massive advantage they can exploit against you to easily defeat you. Jets, especially the [[Me 262 A-1a|Me 262]], have speed, energy retention and heavy armament that make it hard for you to win in a head-on or get your guns on target outside of one. If you're fighting against one, you don't have much of a chance other than to try and snipe them in a head-on before they get their rounds down range. Remember that the Me 262's guns have a notably low muzzle velocity. For propeller fighters, your tactic is the same and has a higher chance of succeeding thanks to your opponents generally weaker armaments and slower speed.\n\n====Counter-tactics====\n<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->\nThe AD-4 has a great burst horizontal turn rate, and can even compete with some of the poorer turning fighters when not laden with armament, though bleeds energy incredibly fast. When attempting to engage an AD-4, use the vertical to your advantage, the AD-4's incredibly high weight makes it almost impossible for it to fire on anyone above them as they will almost immediately lose all momentum.\n\nThe most important piece of information to keep in mind while attacking an AD-4; do NOT go into a head-on versus the plane. The AD-4's inability to get guns on target easily is mitigated if they can commit to a head-on, and with four AN/M3 cannons alongside a relatively tanky structure the AD-4 will have a high chance of critically damaging you and escaping to repair.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The main improvement came with a more powerful R-3350-26WA engine. It also featured stronger landing gear and an improved radar. The armament was increased to four 20 90mm cannons. Provisions were added for 14 Aero rocket launchers. 372 AD-4 Skyraiders were built.\n\nAD Skyraiders made up the bulk of the Navy's ground strike sorties. The only Skyraider air-to-air kill during the war occurred on 16 June 1953. A USMC AD-4 from VMC-1, piloted by Major George H. Linnemeier and CWO Vernon S. Kramer, shot down a Polikarpov Po-2 biplane in that action. Often painted blue, the Skyraider was nicknamed the \"Blue Plane\" by enemy forces during the Korean War. Many Skyraiders were shot down by ground fire during the war while flying low-altitude ground attack missions.\n\nSkyraiders later participated in the Cathay Pacific VR-HEU Incident and the Vietnam War.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=douglas_ad_4 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|qQjxB7WRaJg|'''The Shooting Range #185''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:10 discusses the Douglas Skyraider.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* Douglas [[A2D-1|A2D]] ''Skyshark''\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* Aichi [[B7A2|B7A]]\n* Martin [[AM-1|AM]] ''Mauler''\n* Westland [[Wyvern S4|Wyvern]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/392585-douglas-ad-4-skyraider/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n* [https://www.historynet.com/able-dog-was-the-ad-skyraider-the-best-attack-bomber-ever-built.htm [History Net<nowiki>]</nowiki> Able Dog: Was the AD Skyraider the Best Attack Bomber Ever Built?] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210418234140/https://www.historynet.com/able-dog-was-the-ad-skyraider-the-best-attack-bomber-ever-built.htm Web Archive])\n* [https://www.boeing.com/history/products/ad-a-1-skyraider-bomber.page [Boeing<nowiki>]</nowiki> AD/A-1 SKYRAIDER ATTACK BOMBER] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210418234204/https://www.boeing.com/history/products/ad-a-1-skyraider-bomber.page Web Archive])\n* [https://www.airvectors.net/ava1spad.html [Air Vectors<nowiki>]</nowiki> The Douglas AD / A-1 Skyraider] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210418234200/https://www.airvectors.net/ava1spad.html Web Archive])\n\n{{AirManufacturer Douglas}}\n{{USA strike aircraft}}"}}
