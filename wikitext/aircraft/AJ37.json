In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Ground Breaking\"]]. Being the first Viggen variant produced and intended to replace the [[A32A]], the {{PAGENAME}} offers the air-to-ground capability that the later [[JA37C]] lacks.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nEntering service in 1971, the {{PAGENAME}} is almost 10 years older than the [[JA37C]] found in the fighter line beside it. Despite being almost indistinguishable from each other visually, both aircraft differ heavily in flight performance. The {{PAGENAME}} is noticeably more primitive than its fighter brethren, requiring suspended ordnance to compensate for the lack of internal weapons. This, combined with the weaker powerplant, makes the {{PAGENAME}} feel a lot heavier when fully kitted out. Despite this, the performance is not something to underestimate, as the Viggen platform still offers almost unmatched 'jack of all trades' performance, with excellent manoeuvrability, acceleration, and top speed.\n[[File:AJ37 Scenery.png|left|thumb|350px|AJ37 viewed from behind, making a right turn.]]\nFor better or worse, flying the {{PAGENAME}} is comparable to the Draken family of fighters preceding it. The overall flight performance is so extreme that most opponents the {{PAGENAME}} comes across cannot keep up with it. But a trade-off is still the lack of significant energy retention. When flown recklessly, the {{PAGENAME}} has a hard time keeping its speed up, which can be exploited by more powerful opponents. However, an opponent that does commit to these low speeds is likely to lose due to the low-speed handling of the Viggen. All variants, including the {{PAGENAME}}, come fit with flap systems designed to push air under the main wing, allowing the aircraft to manoeuvre efficiently even when stalling. Because of this, dogfighting often comes down to managing your speed, and ensuring that your manoeuvrability is better than your opponent's, either by forcing an overshoot, or baiting them into committing to a low-speed engagement.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 9,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Despite its size, the {{PAGENAME}} is not well-suited for handling incoming damage. The fuselage is noticeably tanky, but due to the large engine and control surfaces, the likelihood of surviving hits without consequence is fairly small.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|m/71 (120 kg)|psrak m/70|Akan m/55 (30 mm)}}\n{{main|RB24|RB24J|RB 75|Rb05A}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* 2 x 30 mm Akan m/55 cannons (150 rpg = 300 total)\n* 2 x RB24J missiles\n\nThe two stock loadouts on the {{PAGENAME}} allow for either two gun pods, or two RB24J missiles. The performance of the RB24J often allows two guaranteed air kills, which can be important when spading the aircraft. However, more skilled pilots might find more use out of the Akan gun pods as they can down significantly more aircraft in one go and still engage ground targets if needed. They can be somewhat tricky to get used to, however, as they are spaced out from the center of the aircraft, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n* 24 x psrak m/70 rockets\n* 12 x psrak m/70 rockets + 48 x countermeasures\n\n[[File:AJ37 Countermeasures.png|thumb|350px|AJ37 dispensing countermeasures]]\nThe m/70 rockets are the only air-to-ground ordnance shared with the JA37C. The rockets allow for great precision attacks from far range thanks to the ballistic computer, and due to the large explosive filler, a single accurate hit is more than enough to deal with any armoured threat. The rocket placement can be somewhat tricky as they are not centred with the aircraft, similar to the gun pods.\n\n* 2 x Rb05A missiles\n* 2 x Rb05A missiles + 48 x countermeasures\n\nThe Rb05A is unique in its class, as this manually guided air-to-ground missile features a proximity fuze for attacking airborne threats. Although very unconventional to use, this missile is highly potent in ground battles, as the explosive can kill any tank it hits, while also destroying helicopters with ease if needed.\n\n* 2 x RB 75 missiles\n\nThe RB 75 is identical to the [[AGM-65A]] found on other aircraft and performs equally well. This air-to-ground missile uses optical guidance to distinguish targets, allowing it to guide itself after launch. Since the missile is capable of gliding up to 20 km of distance, altitude is preferred when deploying for the best distance and target visibility. When employed correctly, the {{PAGENAME}} can safely stay away from SAM systems while engaging ground vehicles.\n\n* 48 x countermeasures + 2 x RB 75 missiles\n* 48 x countermeasures + 2 x RB24 missiles\n* 48 x countermeasures + 2 x RB24J missiles\n\nThe countermeasures used by the {{PAGENAME}} are carried in two pods, one on each wing. Both come equipped with 24 slots each, dispensing in unison when activated. These flares require some manoeuvring and throttle management to deploy efficiently, especially since the direction they dispense is straight behind the nozzle. Cutting afterburner and banking slightly is always optimal when flaring, and will throw off most heat-seeking missiles.\n\n* 16 x 120 kg m/71 bombs (1,920 kg total)\n* 8 x 120 kg m/71 bombs + 48 x countermeasures (960 kg total)\n\n[[File:AJ37 bombs.png|thumb|350px|AJ37 bombing targets]]\nThe 120 kg m/71s are the only type of bombs found on this aircraft. Carried in groups of four, these bombs are dispensed singularly starting from the left. Their limited explosive mass makes them fairly inefficient at destroying bases in air battles. However, the precision offered by the ballistic computer allows for plenty of stopping power against ground vehicles. These bombs are also a lot safer to use than unguided rockets, as they do not require the pilot to look directly at the target.\n\n* 2 x 30 mm Akan m/55 cannons + 2 x Rb05A missiles\n* 2 x 30 mm Akan m/55 cannons + 2 x RB 75 missiles\n* 2 x 30 mm Akan m/55 cannons + 12 x psrak m/70 rockets\n* 2 x 30 mm Akan m/55 cannons + 2 x RB24J missiles\n* 2 x 30 mm Akan m/55 cannons + 2 x RB24 missiles\n\nThe Akan-paired loadouts give a lot more flexibility when engaging both ground and air targets. The RB24J missiles paired with the 30 mm Akan pods is the most optimal setup for air battles, as it essentially combines the two stock loadouts found early on.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n'''Air Realistic Battles'''\n\n* Use flares when uptiered\n* Always carry RB24J missiles\n* Take as much fuel as possible\n* Avoid higher altitudes\n* Stay as fast as possible when engaging aircraft\n\n[[File:AJ37 Climb.png|thumb|350px|AJ37 seen climbing]]\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has no limitations when it comes to flight performance. The acceleration, manoeuvrability, and top speed outclasses almost any aircraft it faces, giving it plenty of wiggle room for engaging anything it wants. The downside lies in the suspended weaponry, which is very limited for a plane its size. Being unable to carry more than two missiles, and having to choose between countermeasures or gun pods makes engaging air targets in this aircraft troublesome. These downsides are entirely dependent on the opponents a pilot is going against, as some aircraft might have even less to work with than the {{PAGENAME}}, making them easy prey. In downtiers, the {{PAGENAME}} can become unstoppable as the armament becomes secondary. Since the {{PAGENAME}} is one of the best handling supersonic aircraft, facing subsonic and transonic opponents is a walk in the park. When facing these sorts of aircraft, firepower should always be prioritized to maximize the amount of damage the plane can put out. Here, a pilot should focus on going straight in, keeping opponents busy for allied teammates.\n\nWhen facing more potent opponents, however, especially those at higher tiers, the lacklustre weaponry becomes apparent. The {{PAGENAME}} carries half the expected amount of missiles and has no all-aspect capability. On top of this, opponents at this tier often carry potent missiles that require flares to properly avoid. This forces a decision to be made before battle. Since the {{PAGENAME}} is unable to carry flares and guns simultaneously, a pilot has to decide between having better defensive options, or more offensive capability. This often boils down to pilot skill and playstyle, as flying around without countermeasures requires careful planning and split-second decision-making to avoid incoming missiles. In these matches, especially when playing without flares, the {{PAGENAME}} should stay behind teammates, flanking towards the sides in hope of catching opponents off-guard or by themselves.\n\n'''Ground Realistic Battles'''\n\n* Use countermeasures when facing SAM systems\n* Use suspended weaponry of your choice\n* Gain altitude quickly when using RB 75\n* Stay as low and fast as possible when using rockets, bombs, cannons, or the Rb05As\n\nUsing the AJ37 for its intended purpose can sometimes be trickier than fighting aircraft, especially due to the prominent threat of SAM systems. The AJ37 is much more potent compared to the earlier [[A32A]] in almost every regard, but that does not make it immune to anti-air equipment. The best way to counter SAM systems is by flying at high speeds while deploying chaff simultaneously. This forces radar locks to reset, allowing for short timeframes of efficient ground striking. Staying above Mach is almost a requirement, unless terrain can be worked with to avoid sightlines with the SAM launcher. A more daring tactic is to forego countermeasures altogether, and focusing on destroying the SAM system before it even locates the aircraft. This allows for more variety in the suspended ordnance, doubling the number of bombs or rockets, or allowing the use of Akans to combat air targets at the same time.\n\nThis mentality does not apply when using the RB 75, as this missile allows for much further distance when engaging. With over 20 km of launch range, the Maverick missile is able to stay out of the range of ground-based SAM equipment, while still engaging ground targets. The optimal strategy here is to gain altitude directly after spawning, trying to separate a great distance from the battlefield. A great way to check for optimal distance is watching the capture-point marker that tells distance, as it gives a rough estimate of your current range. When beyond 12 km, the average distance a SAM system can reach, a pilot can begin checking for targets on the ground through the sight. Once a target is acquired, turn back and repeat the process. Due to the limited armament, it can be quite handy to carry a second ordnance option or to simply climb near the airfield for quick rearming.\n\n{{Notice|Remember to check for helicopters when using the Rb05A missile! The proximity fuze allows for them to be easily taken down.}}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
