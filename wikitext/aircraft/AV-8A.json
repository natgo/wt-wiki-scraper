It was introduced in [[Update \"New Power\"]]. Like all members of the [[Harrier (Family)|Harrier family]] the AV-8A is a [[VTOL]] aircraft with thrust vectoring nozzles, which allow it to take off and land vertically, in addition to enhancing its manoeuvrability. Among the [[Harrier (Family)]], it has a higher powered engine than the [[Harrier GR.1]], but it has the same engine as the others ([[Harrier GR.3]] and [[AV-8C]]).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe AV-8A can be considered a multirole aircraft which can focus in air-to-air combat, air-to-ground combat and air-to-sea combat. Its firepower and ordnance make it a competitive aircraft in all game modes. The roles can be divided in such:\n\n'''In air-to-air combat:'''\n\nThe Harrier has access to AIM-9G Sidewinder air to air missiles capable of taking down all enemy aircraft in the game. The AIM-9G is a rear-aspect lock-on missile, meaning the Harrier must be behind the enemy aircraft to be able to launch the missile.\n\n'''When facing enemy bombers:'''\n\nEnemy bombers are the easiest targets for the Harrier both in gun strafe and when using missiles as they lack agility when dogfighting against the Harrier and countermeasures such as flares to be able to counter the missiles. However, it is unlikely to face enemy bombers besides the [[Vautour (Family)|Vautours]]. AI-controlled bombers are the exception.\n\n'''When facing enemy attackers:'''\n\nWhen facing player-controlled attackers (not necessarily planes labelled as attackers but planes who focus on ground striking), the pilot must stay aware that, besides the Harrier superior mobility, they can outturn you as they will often fly at lower speeds than you, meaning their turn radius compared to yours will be much smaller. Most of the enemy planes that do CAS runs will often be enemy fighters (not labelled as attackers) but with ground ordnance, meaning they can or will be heavier than you, increasing drag and reducing agility when in a dogfight, use this as an advantage.\n\n'''As an attacker/bomber:'''\n\nThe Harrier has access to a wide variety of ground ordnance capable of destroying enemy ground units and bases. It also has [[Ballistic Computer#CCIP Usage|CCIP]] meaning the pilot has access to ground ordnance crosshairs which will increase accuracy for both rockets and bombs, as well as [[Ballistic Computer#CCRP Usage|CCRP]] allowing for guided approach to target and automatic bomb release. It is advised to fly to your bombing target at as low altitude as possible (NOE flight). This approach has multiple advantages: increased radar interference from terrain masking and terrain clutter, and reduced enemy visibility and awareness. It also makes bombing more accurate, even with the help of ballistics computer. Time fuse is essential for low level bombing, to avoid hitting yourself with shrapnel from your own bombs. Ground striking ordnance should be taken at pilot's discretion, but it is recommended to take the 2 x 1,000 lb and 3 x 500 lb bombs in order to take a whole base completely and still maintain high speed. You are unable to carry any sort of anti-air missiles with this payload.\n\nRadar interference is mostly irrelevant in air realistic battles as the plane will still be highlighted and enemy pilots could use eye aiming. However, it will interfere with radar homing missiles (SARH missiles such as AIM-7E, R-3R, etc. carried by F-4 Phantoms and MiG-21s) and will be your main line of defence when flying in simulator battles, you will be able to fly stealthily in NOE flight.\n\n'''When in combined battles (ground realistic battles):'''\n\nThis is where the Harrier is able to shine as an attacker, primarily using VTOL and hovering mode to an advantage. There is multiple loadouts which can be used in order to make the Harrier a scary attacker.\n\n'''Bomb payload''' - This is often the most used payload for multiple reasons: has the biggest explosion radius compared to rockets, are more forgiving when missing by couple metres, can take multiple targets with a single bomb. The use of ballistics computer makes their aiming much easier than with eye aiming both in realistic and simulator battles.\n\n'''Rocket payload'''- This is the trickiest but most rewarding payload the Harrier can carry (rewarding as it is able to make much more kills than bombs). Tanks can be destroyed with one to three rocket salvos (launched in pairs, meaning with 2 to 6 rockets in total). This means if you take the 76 x Might Mouse rocket payload, you can get up to 12 kills if it takes you 6 rockets per tank.\n\n'''VTOL trick''' - The Harrier can be used as a helicopter thanks to the VTOL capabilities, rockets are recommended if used like this. It is able to hide behind mountains, poke to attack and go back into cover as a helicopter would do. Handling this technique can be tricky and will require practice but is an alternate way of playing CAS.\n\nAIM-9G are not recommended to be taken in Ground Realistic Battles as most of the air to air engagements will be within a kilometre range specially since the AIM-9G's turn radius is fairly narrow, meaning enemy planes can be engaged with the 30 mm ADEN autocannons or be taken by friendly SPAA. It is not recommended to use them against enemy helicopters either as the autocannons are sufficient for them.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Thrust vectoring capabilities\n** Can be used during combat to temporarily boost turn rate \n** Can land and rearm on the helicopter bases in combined battles\n* AIM-9Gs are potent missiles, having a max overload of 18G and a very long burn time\n* 22 different payload options, many of which are great for bombing\n* Powerful 30 mm ADEN cannons with a generous ammo count of 260 rounds (130 per gun)\n* Has a [[HUD#410SUM1|Head-Up Display]] in the cockpit which provides flight information and accurate weapon aiming functionality and is useful in Simulator battles\n* Large supply of 240 countermeasures\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Heavy airframe loses significant speed in turns\n* No Radar Warning Receiver\n* Only gets two air-to-air missiles at most\n* ADEN cannons have low velocity \n* Limited WEP and lack of afterburner\n* Engine overheats very quickly above 90% throttle\n* Using thrust vectoring in combat bleeds speed and leaves you vulnerable\n* Stiffens up in dives; this can be fatal during ground attack missions \n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

At the 1968 Farnborough air show two United States Marine Corps (USMC) pilots, Col. Thomas H. Miller (eventually promoted to Lieutenant General) and Lt. Col. Bud Baker unexpectedly arrived at the Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) chalet and announced they had been sent to test fly the new Harrier GR.1 aircraft. Within 2 weeks of the show both pilots had flown the Harrier and shortly after returned to the US with a very positive report of the aircraft.<ref name=\"HarrierCaseStudy\">Fozard 1978</ref>\n\nWithin three months of the report a team of US test pilots were in the UK evaluating the Harrier and within a further five months the US had declared its intention to buy 110 Harriers by the mid 1970s. The US congress originally insisted that the Harriers should be built in the US, leading to HSA signing a 15 year agreement with McDonnell-Douglas, where McDonnell-Douglas would build the aircraft in the US and both parties would share data and designs of any aircraft related to the Harrier.<ref name=\"HarrierCaseStudy\" /> However later, after realizing the cost increase that would come from shifting production to the US, it was instead decided all 110 aircraft would be built by HSA in the UK. The aircraft would be purchased as \"off the shelf\" products with only limited modifications made from the Harrier GR.1. The US Harriers would have the more powerful Pegasus Mk 103 engine, the ability to carry two Sidewinder missiles, and other minor changes such as US radio equipment.<ref name=\"HarrierCaseStudy\" />\n\nThe Harrier entered service with the USMC in 1971, under the designation AV-8A.<ref name=\"HarrierCaseStudy\" />Marine Attack Squadron 513 (VMA-513) was the first squadron to receive its Harriers with VMA-231 and VMA-542 following. Shortly after it entered service the US decided to replace the British Ferranti FE 541 Inertial Navigation and Attack System (INAS) system with an American system known as \"baseline\". The FE 541 was an advanced system, it was able to use inertial navigation to plot the Harrier's location on a moving map in the cockpit and had various weapons aiming modes to allow for accurate bombing. The US however did not like the FE 541 finding it too complicated and difficult to maintain. In addition the FE 541 required a calibration process to be carried out before use, which could not be completed onboard a ship, severely limiting it's usefulness to the USMC. The baseline system was far simpler than the FE 541 and did not provide navigation functionality; with the removal of the large moving map display the USMC took the opportunity to change the layout of the AV-8A's cockpit making it different to that in British Harriers.<ref name=\"HarrierCaseStudy\" />\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=av_8a Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6918-development-jump-jets-arrive-in-war-thunder-meet-the-harrier-en|[Devblog] Jump Jets arrive in War Thunder: Meet the Harrier]]\n* [http://www.alternatewars.com/SAC/AV-8A_Harrier_SAC_-_November_1972.pdf Standard Aircraft Characteristics of the AV-8A]\n\n===References===\n\n;Citations\n<references />\n\n;Bibliography\n\n* Fozard, J.
