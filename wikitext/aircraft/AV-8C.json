If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe AV-8C can be considered a multirole aircraft which can focus in air-to-air combat, air to ground combat and air to sea combat. Its firepower and ordnance make it a competitive aircraft in all game modes. The roles can be divided in such:\n\n'''When air to air:'''\n\nThe Harrier has access to AIM-9G Sidewinder air to air missiles capable of taking down all enemy aircraft in the game. It should be noted that the AIM-9G is a rear-aspect lock-on missile, meaning the Harrier must be behind the enemy aircraft to be able to launch the missile.\n\n'''When facing enemy bombers:'''\n\nEnemy bombers are the easiest targets for the Harrier both in gun strafe and when using missiles as they lack agility when dogfighting against the Harrier and countermeasures such as flares to be able to counter the missiles. It is unlikely to face enemy bombers besides the [[Vautour IIA IDF/AF (France)|Vautour IIA IDF/AF]] as most of them stay at 8.0. AI-controlled bombers are the exception.\n\n'''When facing enemy attackers:'''\n\nWhen facing player-controlled attackers (not neccesarily planes labelled as attackers but planes who focus on ground striking), the pilot must stay aware that, besides the Harrier superior mobility, they can outturn you as they will often fly at lower speeds than you, meaning their turn radius compared to yours will be much smaller. Most of the enemy planes that do CAS runs will often be enemy fighters (not labelled as attackers) but with ground ordnance, meaning they can or will be heavier than you, increasing drag and reducing agility when in a dogfight, use this as an advantage.\n\n'''As an attacker/bomber:'''\n\nThe Harrier has access to a wide variety of ground ordnance capable of destroying enemy ground units and bases. It also has access to CCIP ballistics computer (refer to [[Ballistic Computer]] for explanation) meaning the pilot has access to ground ordnance crosshairs which will increase ordnance accuracy, both rockets and bombs. It is not recommended to fly as a bomber (in terms of altitude) but fly as a tree cutter (as close to the ground as possible). This is recommended to achieve multiple things: radar interference, max speed, reduce enemy visibility and awareness. It also makes bombing easier without the need of ballistics computer (although it is recommended to use it since it will not require any practice). Time fuze MUST BE ADDED to avoid assault fuze explosion, risking your plane to be hit by the explosion causing a death. Ground striking ordnance should be taken at pilot's discretion, but it is recommended to take the 2 x 1000 lb and 3 x 500lb bombs in order to take a whole base completely and still maintain high speeds. You are unable to carry any sort of anti-air missiles with this payload.\n\n*Note: radar interference is mostly irrelevant in air realistic battles as the plane will still be highlighted and enemy pilots could use eye aiming. However, it will interfere with radar homing missiles (SARH missiles such as AIM-7E, R-3R, etc carried by F-4 Phantoms and MiG-21's) and will be your main line of defence when flying in simulator battles, you will be able to fly stealthily if flying in tree cutting tactic.\n\n'''When in combined battles (ground realistic battles):'''\n\nThis is where the Harrier is able to shine as an attacker, primarily using VTOL and hovering mode to an advantage (will be explained more detailed later). There is multiple loadouts which can be used in order to make the Harrier a scary attacker.\n\n'''Bomb payload:'''\n\nThis is often the most used payload for multiple reasons: has the biggest explosion radius compared to rockets, are more forgiving when missing by couple meters, can take multiple targets with a single bomb. The use of ballistics computer makes their aiming much easier than with eye aiming both in realistic and simulator battles. The x4 1000lb bombs are recommended as, if aimed correctly, will destroy one or multiple enemy targets with a single bomb, meaning you are able to get at least 2 kills (as bombs drop in pair)\n\n'''Rocket payload:'''\n\nThis is the trickiest but most rewarding payload the Harrier can carry (rewarding as it is able to make much more kills than bombs). Tanks can be taken with one to three rocket salvos (launched in pairs, meaning with 2 to 6 rockets in total). This means you are able to get 12 kills (considering you take 6 rockets per tank) if you take the 76 x Might Mouse rocket payload.\n\n'''VTOL trick:'''\n\nHarrier can be used as a helicopter thanks to the VTOL capabilities, rockets are recommended if used like this. It is able to hide behind mountains, poke to attack and go back into cover as a helicopter would do. Handling this technique can be tricky and will require practice but is an alternate way of playing CAS.\n\n*Note: AIM-9G are not recommended to be taken in GRB as most of the air to air engagements will be within a kilometre range specially since the AIM-9G turn radius is really narrow, meaning enemy planes can be taken with the 30 mm ADEN autocannons or be taken by friendly SPAA. It is not recommended to use them against enemy helicopters either as the autocannons are sufficient for them.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Congress approved the purchase of 114 Harriers in 1970. Marine Attack Squadron 513 (VMA-513) was the first squadron to receive its Harriers, with the delivery taking place in March 1971; VMA-231 and VMA-542 received their AV-8As next.\n\nIt was mostly similar to the Harrier GR.1, but had a number of changes. All magnesium components were replaced in order to prevent corrosion. American identification friend or foe (IFF) systems and radio equipment were fitted. The British GR.1 was fitted with the Ferranti FE541 inertial navigation/attack suite, but these were replaced in the USMC Harriers by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming Computer.\n\nThe outer wing pylons were modified to allow the carrying of AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles (AAMs). The AV-8A also utilized a more powerful version of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus than on the GR.1, the Mk 103 (called F402-RR-402 by the Americans).\n\n'''AV-8C Harrier'''\n\n47 AV-8A Harriers were upgraded to the AV-8C standard starting in 1979. Inertial navigation system equipment was added and the Lift Improvement Devices were also improved. Various components were also restored or replaced to increase the service life of the aircraft. The ECM capability was bolstered with the addition of the ALR-45F/APR-43 radar warning receiver and ALE-39 countermeasures dispenser. An AN/ALE-37 chaff-dispenser pod could be carried on a hardpoint.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=av_8c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[AV-8A]]\n* [[Harrier GR.1]]\n* [[Harrier GR.3]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6918-development-jump-jets-arrive-in-war-thunder-meet-the-harrier-en|[Devblog] Jump Jets arrive in War Thunder: Meet the Harrier]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Hawker}}\n{{USA jet aircraft}}"}}
