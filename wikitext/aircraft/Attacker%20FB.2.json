Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nIn terms of armour protection, the {{PAGENAME}} has a bulletproof glass in front of the pilot for some protection against head-on projectiles (although the nose has no armour, so projectiles can still attack the pilot through there. A 12.7 mm armour plate is also present behind the pilot, separating the cockpit from the rest of the fuselage. These armour protection serve more to block against incoming glancing rounds rather than concentrated firepower from the armour's general direction.\n\nThe plane's modules are all centered in the middle of the fuselage, with only small fuel tanks present at the wing roots as an outlier. All fuel tanks are self-sealing so fuel leaks are not a large problem providing that there are enough fuel reserve remaining before the fuel tanks are sealed. The plane's wings and tail do not have modules, but they can suffer damages to the surface areas and control surfaces.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|H.E. M.C. Mk.II (500 lb)|M.C. Mk.I (1,000 lb)|RP-3}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* Without load\n* 2 x 500 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.II bombs (1,000 lb total)\n* 2 x 1,000 lb M.C. Mk.I bombs (2,000 lb total)\n* 12 x RP-3 rockets\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them.
