It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 \"Assault\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe B-10B might come across as fairly mediocre, it accelerates fairly slowly, doesn't have WEP in RB and SB modes, and cruises at altitude at around 280 km/h, which is faster than several contemporary bombers, but isn't overly impressive. However, it is incredibly manoeuvrable for a bomber, it can out-turn most Axis monoplane fighters excluding the Japanese, and can safely deploy flaps for most defensive manoeuvres, and turns very well horizontally but not so much vertically. It, of course, can't out turn biplanes, but can outrun most of them in a shallow dive.\n\nIts primary bomb loads, the single 2,000 lb bomb or the two 1,000 lb bombs, do create a fair amount of drag as they're carried externally, however, the B-10 is fast enough to reach bombing points before having to engage with enemy fighters, so the extra drag generally won't be particularly noticeable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 2,438 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThe B-10B lacks any armour protection, but it is surprisingly durable, not only because it most often fights aircraft only armed with machine guns, but also because most of the wing area is empty of any fuel tanks. The fuel tanks are located between the engines and the fuselage which is an area rarely hit. The B-10 also can run on one engine but only if other areas aren't too heavily damaged: being a generally large and slow aircraft it suffers from drag caused by structural damage substantially, meaning it can destabilise and fall out of the sky if an engine is damaged as well.\n\nThe tail is the most vulnerable area, there's a lot of control surfaces present in the rear of the aircraft, and the elevators are very large targets, machine guns will shred through these areas even if given only a short time on target.\n\nThe crew additionally are fairly vulnerable, the pilot notably is very exposed, being positioned quite high up on the fuselage, the tail gunner as well catches a lot of fire, but due to the B-10's manoeuvrability, the crew become very hard targets to hit while the aircraft is flying defensively.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:B-10B, engaging.jpg||400px|thumb|B-10B Engaging a Bf 109]]\n\nAs a bomber, the B-10B does the job well. It can easily reach bombing points before interception and can level a base with a single 2,000 lb bomb, and can then turn away and return to base to rearm. If enemy fighters are at altitude, consider using clouds for cover, or entering a shallow dive towards friendly fighters, or the airfield.\n\nThis aircraft works very well defensively and can be very effective when flown with a squadmate. As the B-10 is very manoeuvrable, it can out-turn most enemy fighters, but lacks the firepower to deal with them effectively, it has no fixed guns and is only equipped with .30 calibre machine guns, and controlling them manually in a dogfight isn't really a viable option. But when playing with a friend, the B-10 can engage a fighter, and while manoeuvring, can draw the enemy into a low energy state, making it a very easy target to take out.\n\nOn your own, you can still comfortably dogfight one-on-one with most German and Italian monoplane aircraft, but if this fight is away from friendlies, another enemy fighter could engage with you, and being such a large target, a 2-on-1 fight likely won't go in your favour. As you are a big target, and with two enemies around you, one is likely going to take out a critical component sooner or later.\n\nTry diving towards friendlies before engaging in a dogfight, the closer you are to your allies, the more likely it is that they'll come to your aid, the further away you are, the more likely it is that an enemy will join the fight instead.\n\nIf there are no enemies around later on in the match you can attack light ground targets by manually controlling your nose gunner, just make sure to watch out for any trees or ground hazards as there will be a delay before you can switch back to direct control of the aircraft.\n\nThe B-10B also works well in combined tank battles, as the 2,000 lb bomb will be more than enough to take out several tanks in close proximity as most vehicles will be very lightly armoured. It is slow and a large target, but as most anti-air is fairly weak around its battle rating, it should survive a bombing run.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n[[File:B-10B, attacking ground targets.jpg|400px|thumb|The B-10B's nose gunner, strafing artillery targets]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

A single 2,000 lb bomb can net you 850+ points in a match from a good run\n* The frontal gunner, while only having a .30 cal, can be used as a manual weapon if you keep the front of the plane on an enemies tail, or for attacking ground targets\n* As it's a less well-known aircraft, enemies may not know how to effectively fight it\n* It can easily take fire from machine guns on the wings, and in general is fairly survivable\n* While having limited fire arcs on the rear turrets, they cover a wide area and can surprise enemies that don't know they're there\n* The 2,000 lb bomb works well in ground forces\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* It's a large target, and even though the critical components are hard to hit individually, the large wings and tail will accumulate damage over time\n* Despite its comparatively good speed, most Axis and Soviet aircraft can catch up to it easily\n* Unlike its younger brother, the [[B-18A]], the B-10's rear gunners have a slightly restricted field of view over the tail, where the gunners can't fire\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Martin Company in 1932 as the Martin Model 123. It had a number of features that were revolutionary at the time. These included an internal bomb bay, retractable landing gear, and rotating gun turrets. The model 123 did not have fully enclosed crew stations; there were 4 crewmembers. The Model 123 was delivered to the Army for testing in March of 1932, and was designated as the XB-907. It was sent back to Martin for redesigning and was designated as the XB-10. It differed from the Model 123 in that it had a full engine cowling, larger wingspan, fully enclosed crew stations, and a reduction in crew to 3. The Army ordered 48 in 1933, and the first 14 were designated as YB-10, and served as mail carriers for the Army Air Corps Mail Operation.\n\nThe Army ordered an addition 103 aircraft in 1935, which were called the B-10B. These had a more powerful engine. In February 1936, the B-10B's dropped food and supplies to Tangier Island in Virginia and Smith Island in Maryland. The Chesapeake Bay was frozen over by a winter storm, and the only way to get supplies to the islands was by air. Otherwise, the islanders would have starved. In 1936, the last of the Army's orders had been completed, and Martin was given permission to export the B-10. The B-10 was exported to Argentina, China, The Netherlands, The Philippines,  Siam (Thailand), Turkey, and the Soviet Union. Notably, Chinese B-10's were used to drop leaflets on Japan during the Sino-Japanese War. Dutch B-10's also fought in the Dutch East Indies against Japan.\n\nThe B-10 was a huge advance in technology. It was so advanced at the time, that it made all pre-existing bomber designs obsolete. The B-10 set the trend for bomber designs in the years to come. By the time World War 2 was initiated, the B-10 itself had become obsolete, and was replaced by more capable designs, such as the B-18 and B-17.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=b_10b Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Martin 139WC]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* Tupolev [[SB 2M (Family)|SB 2M]]\n* [[Martin 167-A3]] Maryland\n* Mitsubishi [[Ki-21 (Family)|Ki-21]]\n* Heinkel [[He 111 H-3]]\n* Fiat [[BR.20 DR]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/355482-martin-b-10b/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Martin}}\n{{USA bombers}}\n{{USA premium aircraft}}"}}
