It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].\n\nThe B-17E Flying Fortress, as the name suggests, is intended to be used as a high-altitude level bomber, designed to target enemy airfields, military bases, factories, and other infrastructure crucial to winning the war. Despite its large bomb-load, it is not recommended to target moving ground targets, such as tank formations, unless they are the only targets. This is because of the inaccuracy of the bombs at such high altitude, and since columns will simply disperse when they sight bombs falling. When using the B-17E, it is always best to group up with others in a wedge-like formation for optimal defense against air targets and climb to an altitude of, at least, 4,000 m. A few fighter escorts, would ensure the survival of friendly bombers, only if they adopt fighter-sweep tactics to hunt down enemy fighters converging on the formation.\n\nA group of B-17s were captured, repaired, and tested by Japan during WWII.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nGenerally, the plane's role should not diverge from this norm, as it is ineffective and costly as a low altitude bomber. Survival is an utmost importance to be remembered when using this plane. While one target may be missed, there will always be another opportunity to make another pass once reloaded and repaired. The few M2 machine guns in the nose cannot protect the most vulnerable part of any B-17 - the nose. Protected only by a layer of Plexiglas and almost no armour (excluding the frontal bulkhead, which only covers the pilot/co-pilot's torso), most of the crew critical in the success of the mission, including the pilot, co-pilot, bombardier and navigator would be knocked-out instantly. If targeted by German cannons, most notably, the [[MK_108 (30 mm)|Mk 108]]. Just a burst of 30 mm MK 108 placed anywhere on the aircraft , would compromise the crew's survival and even the aircraft's structural integrity.\n\nWhen facing German fighters and interceptors in realistic battles', it is best to use Omni-purpose or Armour-piercing/Ground Targets ammunition belts for the Browning M2 .50 cal turret machine guns, which is likely to punch through their noses when tailing the B-17E. These ammunition belts are effective at tearing through the engine block of a [[Fw_190_D-9|Focke-Wulf Fw 190D]] or [[Bf_109_G-6|Messerschmitt Bf 109G]], hopefully resulting in an internal engine fire, a pilot snipe, or an inoperable engine for the opponent.\n\nIn Simulator mode, the Japanese B-17E offers the same playstyle as the American B-17E with a few special caveats. There are no markers so the Japanese B-17 may be ignored by enemy Allied fighters if they don't look too close, since it is a Flying Fortress. With limited visibility in their cockpit and the light shining their way, it can be difficult to see your Hinomaru roundels. This is a double-edged sword, however. Because as a B-17, you may find yourself under fire by friendly Axis fighters who don't see that you're a friendly plane. It is recommended to tell your team what and where you are so you don't find yourself on the business end of a Ki-84.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Picture taken from the ground looking up as it passes overhead.|thumb|250px|Captured B-17D on its way to the Japanese home islands]]\nAfter the successful invasion of the Philippines, a team of Japanese engineers from the IJAAF \"Koku Gijutsu Kenkyujo\" (Army Aviation Technical Research Institute) discovered multiple B-17 wrecks at Clark Field. Salvaging parts from the various wrecks, the engineers managed to piece together a working B-17D, which was flown back to the Japanese home islands in early 1942 for evaluation.\n\nThe Japanese soon captured Madioen Field, Java, in March. There, they found multiple B-17E wrecks in repairable condition. Eager to get their hands on a working aircraft, Japanese engineers used the piles of spare parts and captured Allied mechanics to rebuild the B-17s. In early 1943, two rebuilt B-17Es took to the air. Through Singapore, the aircraft flew to the home islands escorted by a fighter squadron and a Nakajima L2D transport, the license-produced DC-3. They were careful to alert AAA gunners along the route so they did not get shot down. The squadron arrived safely in the home islands at Tachikawa airfield in mid-1943.\n[[File:Captured Japanese B-17s over mount Fuji.jpg|alt=Two Japanese captured B-17Es and one B-17D flying in front of Mount Fuji.|thumb|Squadron of captured B-17s over Mount Fuji]]\n\nAeronautical engineer Major Kazuyuki Saito and his team of engineers and test pilots oversaw evaluation of the American bombers. Since the Japanese had also obtained complete instruction manuals, every component of the B-17 was thoroughly examined and evaluated. Japanese aeronautical engineers such as Mitsubishi engineer Hisanojo Ozawa, dismissed the B-17E as \"merely modifications made to an old design\" and so the technological systems were deemed more important than the aircraft itself. Of special interest was the famous Norden bombsight, the automatic flight control system, the engine turbochargers and the Sperry Automatic Computing Gunsight. Despite the lack of strategic materials, the Japanese would try to copy what they could to improve their designs.\n\nThe IJAAF (Army) would implement turbochargers in various aircraft such as the [[Ki-83]] and the [[Ki-87]], while the IJNAS (Navy) would use an improved bombsight and an advanced fire-control system in the [[G8N1]] Renzan.\n[[File:B-17 Japan, CW-21B, and SNC-1.jpg|alt=Captured B-17E on the ground on display with a captured CW-21B fighter and SNC-1 trainer|thumb|Captured B-17E displayed with a captured CW-21B and an SNC-1]]\n\nThe B-17s were frequently repainted with American colors and featured in Japanese war films, sometimes with a captured P-40E as escort.\n\nAfter a photographic reconnaissance flight over the Tachikawa facility, American intelligence spotted an unknown Japanese four-engined bomber or transport by the runway. It was dubbed the \"Tachikawa 104\" as they estimated its wingspan was about 104 feet. This estimate was actually really accurate, as the aircraft that they spotted was in fact one of the captured B-17s. (B-17s had a wingspan of 103 feet and 9 inches)<ref>Dwyer, L., 2018.

American intelligence did not realize that fact until after the war.\n\nDuring takeoff for a flight from Fussa in early 1944, one of the B-17Es was caught in a surprise crosswind and its right wing collided with a [[Ki-49 (Family)|Ki-49]] on the ground. It was damaged beyond repair and was never flown again. The second B-17 was photographed around the same location but later disappeared, and it is possible that the third B-17 was destroyed in the tragic hangar fire at Tokorazawa Airfield.<ref>''Japanese B-17 Squadron''. 2019.
