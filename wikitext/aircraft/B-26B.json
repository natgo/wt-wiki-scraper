To make matters worse, the B-26 had a reputation for being very challenging to keep in the air with only one engine. While the Marauder is often able to absorb a considerable amount of punishment, it is unlikely you'll make it alive back to base. Use your speed to keep pursuing fighters on your tail, where your relatively well protected defensive gunners can discourage pursuit.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Martin company in 1939 to the same USAAC specification (Circular Proposal 39-640) as the North American B-25 Mitchell, and both were accepted off the drawing board. Unsurprisingly, the two airplanes share much in common: twin-engined medium bombers, similar in size, with similar offensive and defensive armament. Both saw service in all major theaters of the war, with both U.S. and allied forces.\n\nWhat sets the B-26 Marauder apart is that it was designed for speed; designed around two massively powerful Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engines, its maximum speed is a full 10% faster than its slightly smaller and lighter B-25 counterpart. However, this speed came at a cost. With high wing loading and demanding flight characteristics, the B-26 was noticeably harder to fly than the Mitchell. This pilot skill differential, combined with the pressures of wartime training, led to a track record of deadly crashes early in the plane’s history, gaining a reputation as a \"widow maker\".\n\nDespite this unpromising start to its career, the B-26 Marauder racked up a solid combat record. Mostly deployed at medium altitude missions, it became known for accurate bombing, and by the end of the war, the U.S. 9th Air Force reported that the so-called \"widow maker\" recorded the lowest combat loss rate of any aircraft type.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_B-26_Marauder</ref> One B-26, named \"Flak Bait\", survived over 200 missions and is on display at the Smithsonian Institution's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flak-Bait</ref>\n\nAlthough most of its combat flying was done in the European Theater of Operations, a notable early engagement in the Pacific was the sortie of four torpedo-equipped Marauders against the Japanese fleet during the Battle of Midway. None of the torpedoes hit, two of the planes were lost, and the other two returned so badly shot-up that they were written off. Over the fleet and pursued by Japanese A6M Zeroes, a B-26 named \"Susie Q\" actually overflew the length of the Akagi’s flight deck at very low level, strafing the deck crew with its machine guns. Susie Q landed, just barely, back at Midway with over 500 bullet holes.<ref>https://www.pacificwar.org.au/Midway/USArmy_at_Midway.html</ref>\n\nThe in-game version represents the B-26B model after some modifications had been made, including lengthening the wings to improve (but not eliminate) the tricky handling characteristics. Most B-26 were built at the Glenn L. Martin plant in Baltimore, Maryland, but the essentially identical B-26C (found in the French tech tree) was built in Omaha, Nebraska. A total of 5,288 aircraft of all models were built between 1941 and 1945.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_B-26_Marauder</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=b_26b_c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7577-development-b-26-marauder-into-the-fray-en|[Devblog] B-26 Marauder: Into the Fray]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Martin}}\n{{USA bombers}}\n<references />"}}
