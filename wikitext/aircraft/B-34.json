In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]].\n\nThe B-34 is a typical American bomber in the sense that its decent payload is outdone by its defensive armament. While its maximum payload and the ability to carry a torpedo is nice, it's not necessarily as good as its ability to take and give out damage to other aircraft. Start with base/pillbox bombing, and should an enemy fighter come to engage, give him hell with your turrets. Do slight ''maneuver''s constantly to throw off his shots while trying to put as many shells into his engine/pilot as possible. With any luck he will fall out of the sky in no time.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nWhile flying the B-34 you can expect manoeuvrability and speed like few other bombers. Considering you are just a [[:Category:Second rank aircraft|Rank II]] aircraft you have a good acceleration and max speed, which will allow you to get out of difficult situations, even being able to outrun some lower BR fighters, although never forget to use your turrets to shake enemies off your tail.\n\nYour speed and climb ratio will be superior to most enemy bombers you face, therefore making it an easy task to intercept them. Although try to always keep it under 4,500 m as your engines aren't meant for high altitudes, and you will become a big and sluggish target for any fighter around. As a last defensive manoeuvre in this bomber it is possible to trade some altitude for speed in order to escape from a threat, however keep it at a max speed of 610 km/h IAS since going faster than that will completely lock your surface controls and eventually get you killed.\n\nGiven its surprising turn rate and speed for a bomber, mixed with a good offensive power, when used wisely you can successfully intercept enemy aircrafts that aren't yet aware of your position, as well as support your allies if you see an enemy tunnel vision-ed on them, however don't fool yourself into a dogfight since every fighter will outturn you sooner than later.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,572 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nIn the hands of an experienced player, the B-34 can be one of, if not the deadliest aircraft of its tier. While being in the bomber line of the tech tree, the B-34 is better suited for use as a frontine bomber, bomber interceptor, and even a heavy fighter in some situations. If played in a bombing role, try to get in low and entice enemy fighters into chasing you while you go for your bombing targets; your powerful 12.7 mm turret will make quick work of most enemy's you'll encounter at its tier. If played as a bomber interceptor, aiming for crucial parts of the target's aircraft (Engine, wings, cockpit, Etc.) with your robust offensive armament will take down enemy bombers quickly and efficiently. Using the B-34 in a heavy fighter role will require the use of your flaps, so make sure to use them when appropriate; as the B-34 has poor energy retention. Head-on's with enemy fighters are ill-advised, as your pilot is quite susceptible to frontal enemy fire as well as your engines that will take damage quite easily.\n\nYour deadliest enemies will be aircraft with heavy machine gun or cannon armament (P-400, LaGG-3-8, Spitfire Mk IIb, Etc.) It is advised to get familiar with using the 12.7 mm dorsal turret while doing evasive maneuvers using flaps for dealing with them quickly before they can do major damage to your aircraft. If they dive on you and fly in front of you for a bit, try to damage them with your frontal armament. Do not let anyone get under your belly, as it is a huge weak spot that knowledgeable players will exploit. In the hands of a skilled pilot, however, you will have no problem going for engine shutdowns or pilot snipes that will quickly send your foes back to the hangar.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The Lockheed company sent a drawing of their Model 14 Super Electra civilian airliner. The British Purchasing Commission saw the design and asked Lockheed to make modifications to the Model 14. Modifications included two fixed forward-firing Browning 7.7 mm machine guns in the nose. There was also the installation of  a Boulton Paul dorsal gun turret with two Browning machine guns. Some models had beam guns installed, while others had different engines or propellers. It was renamed the Lockheed Hudson. The Hudson served as the basis for the B-34 (Ventura, originally). It was developed from the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, another civilian airliner. The Ventura was first delivered to the British in 1942. Originally, it was used for daylight raids but, like other RAF bombers of the time, were vulnerable without fighter escort. It was transferred to Coastal Command. In US service, it was named the B-34 Lexington. There was also a reconnaissance variant   called the B-37 (and later the RB-37, the \"R\" standing for \"restricted,\" as in not for combat). Later on, a redesigned version, the PV-2 Harpoon, was put into service. The wingspan was increased, among other changes. \n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=b_34 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|fF2VBZIVaHQ|'''B-34 Ventura \"Operation Christmas Tree Is Officially Dead!\"''' - ''Bo Time Gaming''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[PV-2D]] - Major redesign with increased load capacity\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4356-development-lockheed-b-34-hudson-s-bigger-brother-en|[Devblog] Lockheed B-34: Hudson’s bigger brother]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341980-lockheed-b-34-lexington/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Lockheed_Ventura|[Wikipedia] Lockheed Ventura]]\n* [https://www.airforce.gov.au/sites/default/files/minisite/static/7522/RAAFmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A59.htm <nowiki>[RAAF Museum]</nowiki> TECHNICAL DATA: Lockheed-Vega Ventura]\n* [https://www.pacificwrecks.com/aircraft/pv-1/tech.html <nowiki>[Pacific Wrecks]</nowiki> Lockheed PV-1 Ventura Technical Information]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lockheed}}\n{{USA bombers}}"}}
