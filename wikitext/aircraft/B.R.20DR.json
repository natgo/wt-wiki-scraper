In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]] alongside the initial Italian aviation tree.\n\nThe BR.20 has a superb bomb load and is quite strong, being able to soak up a bit more damage than other comparable bombers. The defensive armament has excellent coverage; however, the dorsal gunner is quite exposed and commonly gets hit while in combat. It not only looks but also flies like a brick. This is a very slow plane and in Arcade and Realistic battles, and because these game modes are so short, by the time you reach your bombing target the match may almost be over! The BR.20 is still however quite a treat to fly and is stable and well suited to Simulator.\n\nAnother very interesting strategy the BR.20 DR is capable of is ironically, attacking other bombers. When the top & front gunner are pointed forward, the combined firepower of three 7.7 machine guns makes for a nasty surprise, especially if loaded with the AP-I belt!\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Air battles'''\n\nThe BR.20 DR is a very good bomber at its BR, at the start of battle climb to 3,000-4,500 m, and go to destroy the enemy bases, as everytime enemy fighters or other planes are gonna attack you, use your gunners to kill enemy planes, use Universal belt because it contains 1 tracer and 3 AP-I shells per belt. The AP-I shells are perfect for killing enemy planes because they can knock out the enemy pilot or set on fire the enemy planes. When you are near the enemy base, use your bomber sight for drop your bombs and after it return to the airfield to reload your bombs.\n\n'''Ground battles'''\n\nYou can use the BR.20 DR in ground mode, use these following payloads: 4 x 250kg (GP 250) or 2 x 500 kg (GP 500) or 2 x 800kg (GP 800). After spawning with the BR.20 DR, stay at 900-1,500 m altitude and use your bomb sight to drop your bombs more accurately. Your bombs are very good so if the bombs happen to get close to enemy medium and heavy tanks, they can be very easily destroyed.\n\n'''AB Mode'''\n\nLike any bomber in Arcade Battles, they are the first too be destroyed, climb to 4,000 m-5,000 m and stay at that altitude and drop your bombs on enemy bases but remember that you can be destroyed very easily by enemy planes so be careful and check around you if they are incoming enemy planes.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

More than 500 were produced over seven years, and it served on all of Italy's fronts, including Africa, Russia, the Mediterranean, and the Balkans. B.R.20s based in Belgium participated in the Battle of Britain, taking heavy losses.\n\nDesigned by Fiat's Celestino Rosatelli, the B.R.20 had a metal structure and duralumin/fabric covering. Its specifications had called for a top speed of 388 km/h, a bomb load of 1,200 kg, and a range of 960 km, all of which it easily surpassed. Two modified B.R.20s competed in the 1937 Istres-Damascus-Paris air race, but did not win. In 1939, another modified B.R.20 set an endurance record for a 4,800 km flight from Rome to Addis Ababa, averaging more than 400 km/h along the route.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1939 B.R.20s served in the Spanish Civil War. The model did less well in the Battle of Britain, where the Italian air corps lost a quarter of its 80 B.R.20Ms in their first 300 hours in the air. The model continued to be produced until 1942.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=br_20_dr Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|ZZjOyn9p4f8|'''Realistic: {{PAGENAME}} [Fun Ugly Duckling]''' - ''Jengar''|jQg7Tti2eKY|'''Update 1.69 - {{PAGENAME}}'''0k - ''TheEuropeanCanadian''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[B.R.20M M1]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* [[B-10B]]\n* [[He 111 H-3]]\n* [[SB 2M (Family)]]\n* [[Ki-21-Ia]]\n* [[Martin 139WC]]\n* [[Martin 167-A3]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4758-fiat-br-20-dr-a-ruthless-warbird-en|[Devblog] Fiat BR.20 DR - A Ruthless Warbird]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/364957-br20/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Fiat_BR.20|[Wikipedia] Fiat BR.20]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Fiat}}\n{{Italy bombers}}"}}
