It was introduced in [[Update 1.93 \"Shark Attack\"]]. Something players will notice after getting this aircraft is that while the fuselage remains overall unchanged from [[BR.20 DR|its predecessor]], the B.R.20M M1 has a redesigned nose, with a smaller glass area for the gunner, and more glass at the lower section of the nose.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nDesigned by Fiat's Celestino Rosatelli in the mid 1930s and first flying 10 February 1936, the \"Bombardiere Rosatelli 20\" (B.R.20)  ''Cicogna'' (Stork) was an advanced design with a first for Italy all metal structure of duralumin. The fuselage was a space frame structure with the forward half covered in sheets of aluminum and the rear half fabric covering, including all the tail surfaces. The wing was all clad in metal, but the ailerons were also fabric covered. This may seem unusual compared to better known modern semi-monocoque structure, but it was a very common and effective design for the 1930s.\n\nTypical with Italian aircraft was the retractable turrets and wind driven electrical turbine which was also retractable. The engines and propeller were domestic modifications of foreign makes, and the armament was Italian Breda-SAFAT machine guns in Breda designed turrets. Overall it proved to be a successful machine for the Italians and very competitive with foreign types then in service.\n\nEarly on it was earning awards for long distance and payload competitions and was an easy-to-fly stable platform. During the Spanish Civil War it did well with very few losses. This caught the attention of the Japanese Army, who had an urgent need for bombers, and the B.R.20 was chosen after a cursory review of other candidates. Eventually the Japanese purchased 82 fully equipped bombers, a huge purchase for the time. It served well in China, and was almost as good as the first of the Ki-21s, however the defending fighters were more numerous and better than in Spain and losses mounted.\n\nAfter war in Europe broke out and France was defeated, Italy sent a contingent of B.R.20s with fighter escorts to attack England with Germany. There the age of the ''Cicogna'' was apparent as losses were extremely heavy. Not even 4 years old, these bombers where clearly vulnerable to and rapidly being outclassed by new aircraft like the Ju 88 and A-20. Unfortunately the Italians were slow to make a better replacement, and the B.R.20 had to soldier on.\n\nFor the last few years of Italian belligerence, the B.R.20 was used in less active theatres, avoiding strong defences and managing to eke out some success in the Mediterranean and East Europe until the Italians surrendered. After the Italian Armistice the 67 remaining aircraft were used for mundane duties and training. The last was retired in 1946, none were preserved, only dusty photos and a few scattered parts remain.\n\nThis model, the \"M\", was improved over the original with lightly longer nose, more powerful engines, and the top turret replacing the 7.7 mm with a single 12.7 mm retractable powered turret.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=br_20m_m1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|mZ4JVMgNWaA|'''{{PAGENAME}}.
