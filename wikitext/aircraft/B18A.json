It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]].\n\nSweden had been using the Ju 86K (export version of the German Ju 86) or the B3C bomber as their main bomber. In 1938 a requirement was put forth to Swedish aircraft manufactures for a fast reconnaissance aircraft with a crew of three. SAAB was awarded the contract for the project and began to build the SAAB 18 alongside the smaller SAAB B17 bomber. At this point the B17 had the facilities priorities in construction, however, the B18 was modified from being just a reconnaissance aircraft to also being a medium bomber. The mid-project changes caused a significant delay in the production of the aircraft which didn't roll out for duty until mid-1944.\n\nInitially, the B18A aircraft was deemed underpowered with the two Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp radial engines, but would later be replaced by license-built Daimler-Benz DB 605 liquid-cooled engines. Later the B18B variant was modified to operate as a dive bomber/ground attack variant which could be outfitted with three 120 kg bombs or 12 m/51 rockets which could utilize both the internal bomb bay and hardpoints on under the wings. A single defensive positions utilised two 13.2 mm Akan m/39 machine guns which had limited coverage the rear dorsal position of the aircraft. The pilot was in control of a single 13.2 mm m/39A machine gun.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} was a multi-role aircraft which filled a need for the Swedish air forces, which continued on until 1959.  This bomber can operate in two roles, either as a medium-altitude bomber working on destroying vehicles and anti-aircraft artillery targets or to bomb enemy bases. Flying at a higher altitude will help to avoid a majority of the fighter aircraft which tend to stay at the lower altitudes. The {{PAGENAME}} can also be pressed into service in the lower altitudes and even on the deck. When outfitted with rockets, the {{PAGENAME}} can dive-bomb ground targets to include tanks, bunkers, anti-aircraft artillery and naval ships.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe B18A is a really good aircraft in all game modes. Its frontal armament is really powerful, using HEF shells. It does have a low ammo count of 300 for all guns, including the turrets. The B18A is a good bomber hunter, as you'll be facing He 111s which have such poor defensive armaments. You can easily destroy axis bombers with this plane. The G4M1 and He 111 don't hold a candle to this bomber. You can use this plane in all roles, even fighter.\n\n'''Bomber:''' This plane can carry enough bombs to destroy 2 and a half bases on maps with three bases, and 1 base on maps with four respawning bases with its max bomb payload. Once you drop your payload, you can kill any remaining bombers or fighters still hanging around. Remember, if an aircraft is on your six, outspeed them and use your turrets to your advantage.\n\n'''Ground Attacker/CAS:''' With 2 x 500 kg + 8 x 50 kg bombs, this plane is a devastating ground attacker. The 500 kg bombs will one shot anything in a huge radius, while the 50 kg ones require more precise drops. It is a great aircraft for ground support. Watch out for SPAAs though, as they will find you a large and easy target.\n\n'''Fighter/Bomber Hunter:''' The 13 mm is absolutely devastating. When you prepare for an engagement with a bomber, go head-on, and try to bait them into getting behind you. Use your turrets from below where they have no coverage, and aim for the cockpit. For fighter engagements, you need to ask yourself three things. Am I faster than them? Am I higher than them? Can I dive at least 1.5 kilometers? If the answer to any of them is yes, go for the engagement. Otherwise, run away, and use your good turret coverage and acceleration to speed away and chip with your turrets.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Initially designed to replace the older Ju 86 bombers in Swedish service, the Saab 18 series were capable of fulfilling fast reconnaissance, bomber and attack roles. Upon its introduction in 1944, the B18A became the mainline Swedish medium bomber and was later complemented by the B18B and T18B variants. The last Saab 18s were retired at the end of the 1950s as advanced jet aircraft, such as the Saab 32 Lansen, became widely available.\n\nDuring the late interwar period, Sweden looked for a new medium bomber to replace their obsolete Ju 86 bombers. Saab was awarded the contract for this aircraft shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, but was forced to slow down development in order to expedite production of the Saab 17 due to the start of WWII. The first Saab 18 flew in June of 1942, and tests soon proved that the aircraft was quite underpowered for its size. Despite this, the aircraft was ordered into production as the B18A.\n\nThe B18A had a relatively conventional design with a mid-mounted wing and a pair of vertical stabilisers. The aircraft was manned by a crew of three: a pilot, navigator and bombardier. The aircraft had a fixed armament of three 13.2 mm machine guns for defensive purposes along with up to 1000 kilograms of bombs internally along with eight 50 kg bombs on the wings.\n\nThe B18A entered service in 1944 with the Swedish air force, with a total of 62 aircraft built. The aircraft was later developed into the improved B18B variant, which was refined for dive-bombing. This variant was in turn developed into the T18B, which was originally designed to serve as a torpedo bomber but ended up as an attack aircraft, fitted with additional frontal-firing weapons including a 57 mm cannon. The B18A was finally phased out in the late 1950s, replaced by the Saab 32 Lansen. Not a single B18A survives today, though a single B18B is on display at the Swedish Air Force Museum.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=saab_b18a Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:B18A upper rear view.jpg|B18A from above rearside view \nFile:B18A frontal side view.jpg|B18A frontal side view\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Similar role\n* [[Ju 88 A-4]]\n* [[Ki-21 (Family)|Ki-21]]\n* [[Martin 167-A3]]\n* [[Potez 633]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/474731-saab-b18a/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Saab}}\n{{Sweden bombers}}"}}
