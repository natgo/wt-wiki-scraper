If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe B5N2 is a Japanese torpedo-bomber that is lacking in offensive armaments and is defended by a single [[Type 92 (7.7 mm)|7.7 mm Type 92]] machine gun at the back, which makes it lacking in defence against enemy pursuers. Its greatest weapon is not the speed to outrun enemy fighters but its manoeuvrability and ability to do tight turns against most enemy aircraft till help arrives from the team.\n\nThe B5N2 might lack in offensive weaponry such as machine guns and cannons but it has a great variety of payload from 60 kg bombs to 800 kg bombs and even torpedoes in its arsenal to take out ground and naval targets with. Coming with 2 different 800 kg bombs, its important to pick the one most suitable for the mission, preferably the [[Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 (800 kg)|Navy Type Number 80 Model 1]] over the [[Navy Type 99 Number 80 AP (800 kg)|Navy Type 99 Number 80 AP]], with the benefit that the [[Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 (800 kg)|Type Number 80 Model 1]] has a better blast radius and more explosive power than the [[Navy Type 99 Number 80 AP (800 kg)|Type 99 Number 80 AP]] bomb which is good at taking out a single heavily armoured target. It also come with two different sets of 250 kg bombs that can be dropped one by one and are preferable when striking at two different targets than a singular 800 kg.\n\nAgainst naval targets, it's most preferred to use the [[Type 91 Mod.2]] and [[Type 91 Mod.3]] to deal with the sailors, keep in mind to dive and get fast speed to quickly get in and out of engagement with a warship or patrolboat to minimize the risk of being shot down. But when doing a dive attack to get the speed its important to not go over the speed limit where the B5N2 can drop the torpedoes without having them explode in the water on contact which would make the attack futile.\n\nEvery enemy should be seen as a serious threat to the B5N2, as it does not have an offensive armament. The only thing the plane has when it comes to armament is 1 7.7 mm machine gun, which is not a reliable way to fend off enemies with it lacks damage and doesn't offer the best coverage, but at 1.7 it might be enough to scare off ill-armoured biplanes.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

About ~1149 Nakajima B5N Torpedo bombers were made for the Japanese Navy. It would see service in World war 2 and was the Japanese Navy's primary torpedo bomber for the early part of World war 2. The Nakajima B5N Torpedo bomber was credited with the sinking of three US Carriers the USS Lexington CV-2, USS Yorktown CV-6 and USS Hornet CV-8. One of the most notable pilot of the B5N is Mitsuo Fuchida, who led the first wave of aircraft during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nAlthough a total of 5,928 B5Ns were built, none survived the war. Two B5N's are know to exist, both made from wreckage's. One can be seen at the Pearl Harbor Memorial, it is missing it's tail, left wing, engine, canopy, and a few other parts.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nBefore the advent of the B5N, Japan used the B2M and B4Y as torpedo biplanes. However, the significant limitations of biplanes were obvious, so in 1935, inspired by the monoplane A5M fighter, the Imperial Japanese Navy developed the 10-Shi torpedo bomber specification.\n\nNakajima and Mitsubishi participated in the competition. Nakajima decided to incorporate many new ideas in their B5N design. The prototype had a hydraulic wing-folding system so that the plane could be stored on an aircraft carrier, and Fowler flaps were used to improve stability while landing. In addition, the B5N had a hydraulic retractable landing gear system.\n\nAlthough Mitsubishi also received an order for production of its own B5M torpedo bomber, the Nakajima model won the contest and in 1937 was accepted as a production model carrier-based torpedo bomber.\n\nTo create a production model, however, some changes had to be made in the prototype's design. The wing-folding system was changed to a manual one, and the flaps were replaced with conventional ones.\n\nIn 1939, the B5N2 was developed. It differed from its predecessor in its more powerful and reliable Sakae engine, which produced 1000 hp instead of the Hikari 3's 770.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, the B5N torpedo series had no worthy competitors among Allied aircraft and made a great showing in the attack on Pearl Harbor, as well as in subsequent operations, where B5N forces sank four U.S. aircraft carriers within one year.\n\nA total of 5,928 B5Ns were built.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=b5n2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|qsHfTef-Xvg|'''The Shooting Range #293''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:22 discusses the B5N and B6N torpedo bombers.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/479188-b5n2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Nakajima}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
