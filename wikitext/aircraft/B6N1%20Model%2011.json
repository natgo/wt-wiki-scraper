In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Starfighters\"]].\n\n[[File:B6N1 firing turret.png|thumb|The B6N1 in flight]]\n\nThe Allied reporting name for this aircraft was \"Jill\".\n\nIt is the successor to the B5N, and if you liked the [[B5N2]], you will LOVE the {{PAGENAME}}. Simply put, the B6N is a faster, more well defended B5N, and it will prove useful in a combat situation.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nGreat rudder responsiveness, good roll rate, and surprisingly good energy retention! The {{PAGENAME}} is capable of turnfighting with its humble frontal machine gun, and if they get on your 6, your turrets will offer some protection.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,800 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

The Stealth belt is a great pick because it has two incendiary bullets, and lots of armour-piercing rounds. Universal is a great pick if you need a tracer or two to guide your shots. Don't use the Tracers belt, it won't do much. Default isn't really good, the ball bullets hinder performance.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Navy Type 97 Number 6 (60 kg)|Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 (250 kg)|Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 (800 kg)|Type 91 Model 2 (835 kg)|Type 91 Model 3 (850 kg)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* 6 x 60 kg Navy Type 97 Number 6 bombs (360 kg total)\n* 2 x 250 kg Navy Type Number 25 Model 2 bombs (500 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg Navy Type Number 80 Model 1 bomb (800 kg total)\n* 1 x 835 kg Type 91 Model 2 torpedo\n* 1 x 850 kg Type 91 Model 3 torpedo\n\nThe 800 kg bomb will destroy 1 base, it's a good pick for maps with few ground targets! The 250 kg bombs are great for destroying pillboxes and tanks, but you can only have two of them. Make sure to use a slight dive when bombing and use the bombsight for increased accuracy! The 6 x 60 kg bombs are a great option for this plane. Since they weigh so little, you can be super accurate with these bombs, just aim the crosshair where you want the bomb to drop, and pull up. No need for a bomb sight!!! Use these bombs for light targets such as AAA, Vehicles, Armoured Cars, Artillery, Howitzers, Machine Guns, and Bridges. The torpedoes are not really useful for this plane in air battles, as ships only spawn in pacific maps, and this plane is at too low of a BR to be put in a Pacific Theater battle.\n\n[[File:B6N1GrayCamo2.png|thumb|B6N1 showing off its large wings. These wings give the plane a great speed and turning ability]]\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Type 92 (7.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun, dorsal turret (679 rpg)\n* 1 x 7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun, ventral turret (679 rpg)\n\nThe Type 92 turrets are absolutely horrible at dealing with higher BR planes, but it works wonders on biplanes. You will often face certain biplanes at this BR, and since they are slow, you can often get good shots on them. Use the Default belt and shoot into the engine to start an inextinguishable engine fire. This works quite often with the Default belt. The AP-T round is a good pick if you aren't a good gunner, because the extra tracers will scare the enemy off. Most biplanes don't want to get too close when they see a wave of tracers appear from your turrets.\n\n[[File:B6N1 diving.png|thumb|The B6N1 diving on an unsuspecting target]]\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis plane is great for bombing medium tanks, light pillboxes, howitzers, and vehicles. Since it is so fast, it can make multiple trips to the airfield if a resupply of bombs is needed.\n\nFor naval maps and naval gamemode it's best advised to bring the torpedo and hit ships in a quick, close, hit and run style torpedo run, the engine allows for high speeds and Japanese torpedoes are among the highest speed resistant torpedoes in-game at the cost of range of only 2 km. It is also a possibility of squading up with friends / other torpedo carrying planes to dispose of the enemy carriers / battleships in a multiple hit torpedo strike.\n\nYour frontal machine gun is your biggest asset. Unlike the B5N2 or other B6Ns, the B6N1 carries a frontal machine gun that can destroy light AAA trucks or Armoured cars. Or even enemy planes in uptiers, as the B6N has an amazing turn rate for a monoplane, but will have issues trying to out-turn biplanes.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Named JILL in the Allied code, this large single-engine plane appeared as a prototype in spring 1941. The first tests revealed serious steering stability problems. Subsequently, there were difficulties in developing the engine and the need to reinforce the landing gear. After 133 units of the first version of the B6N1 were built, the second production model began to be delivered towards the end of 1943. A total of 1,268 units were built.\n\nThe B6N1 was the first stage of the B6N series, and was fitted with a Nakajima NK7A Mamoru engine in favor by Nakajima instead of the more readily and proved Mitsubishi Kasei engine the Navy suggested.\n\nAfter 2 prototypes of the B6N1, 133 B6N1s were manufactured and immediately issued to the last remaining aircraft carrier groups such as on the Japanese carrier Zuikaku.\n\nDue the slow and costy production of the NK7A engine, the B6N1 was halted in production in favor of the [[B6N2 Model 12|B6N2]] with Mitsubishi MK4T Kasei 25 engine.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=b6n1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n[[File:B6N1 fighting P-26.png|thumb|right|The B6N1 using its turrets to damage the Peashooter]]\n;Related Development\n{{main|B6N (Family)}}\n\n* [[B5N2|B5N]] <small>- (predecessor)</small>\n* [[B6N1 Model 11|B6N1 mod. 11]] <small>- (base model)</small>\n* [[B6N2 Model 12|B6N2 mod. 12]] <small>- (main production model)</small>\n* [[B6N2a Model 12Ko|B6N2a mod. 12A]] <small>- (revised tail armament)</small>\n\n;Similar aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n{{main|:Category:Torpedo_bombers|l1=Torpedo bombers}}\n\n* [[B5N2]]\n* [[TBD-1]]\n* [[TBF-1C]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/421216-nakajima-b6n-tenzan-improved-torpedo-bomber/&ct=1594313939 <nowiki>[Forum]</nowiki> Nakajima B6N Tenzan: Improved Torpedo Bomber]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/488113-b6n1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Nakajima}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
