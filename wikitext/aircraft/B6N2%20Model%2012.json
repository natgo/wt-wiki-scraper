The 250kg bombs are great for destroying pillboxes and tanks, but you can only have two of them. Make sure to use a slight dive when bombing and use the bombsight for increased accuracy! The 6x 60kg bombs are a great option for this plane. Since they weigh so little, you can be super accurate with these bombs, just aim the crosshair where you want the bomb to drop, and pull up. No need for a bomb sight!!! Use these bombs for light targets such as AAA, Vehicles, Armored Cars, Artillery, Howitzers, Machine Guns, and Bridges. The torpedoes are not really useful for this plane in air battles, as ships only spawn in pacific maps, and this plane is at too low of a BR to be put in a Pacific Theater battle.\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis plane is great for bombing medium tanks, light pillboxes, howitzers, and vehicles. Since it is so fast, it can make multiple trips to the airfield if a resupply of bombs is needed.\n\nFor naval maps and naval gamemode it's best advised to bring the torpedo and hit ships in a quick, close, hit and run style torpedo run, the engine allows for high speeds and Japanese torpedoes are among the highest speed resistant torpedoes in-game at the cost of range of only 2 km. It is also a possibility of squading up with friends / other torpedo carrying planes to dispose of the enemy carriers / battleships in a multiple hit torpedo strike.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Named JILL in the Allied code, this large single-engine plane appeared as a prototype in spring 1941. The first tests revealed serious steering stability problems. Subsequently, there were difficulties in developing the engine and the need to reinforce the landing gear. After 133 units of the first version of the B6N1 were built, the second production model began to be delivered towards the end of 1943. A total of 1,268 units were built.\n\nThe B6N2 is the main production model of the B6N series thanks to a more readily available Mitsubishi ''Kansei'' engine, instead of a in-house Nakajima ''Mamori'' engine trialed on the [[B6N1 Model 11|B6N1]].\n\nThe B6N2 has seen alot of use in the southern pacific land bases and few remaining carrier groups. Due to lack of experienced pilots and growing allied air power, the B6N couldn't accomplish the same / better feats the B5N has done in its prior years of the war and damage to the enemy fleet were low and overall performance was average.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=b6n2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related Development\n{{main|B6N (Family)}}\n\n* [[B5N2|B5N]] <small>- (predecessor)</small>\n* [[B6N1 Model 11|B6N1 mod. 11]] <small>- (base model)</small>\n* [[B6N2 Model 12|B6N2 mod. 12]] <small>- (main production model)</small>\n* [[B6N2a Model 12Ko|B6N2a mod. 12A]] <small>- (revised tail armament)</small>\n\n;Similar aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n{{main|:Category:Torpedo_bombers|l1=Torpedo bombers}}\n\n* [[B5N2]]\n* [[TBD-1]]\n* [[TBF-1C]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/488114-b6n2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Nakajima}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
