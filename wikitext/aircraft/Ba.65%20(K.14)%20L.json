In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]].\n\nThe Breda Ba.65 (K.14) L does its job well thanks to a high ammo count and the fact that it receives an air spawn in Realistic Battles (which makes up for the slow top speed). In Realistic, most of the time you will be flying against Soviet planes or on some maps, Americans and British. Your tail gunner, which is armed with a 7.7 mm machine gun, will do medium to high amounts of damage if armed with Universal belts. The 7.7 mm machine gun is more dangerous the closer the enemy gets. If you get a chance at a head-on, go for it because you will most likely win- the plane has very strong frontal armament for its tier.\n\nThe Ba.65 is one of few reserve aircraft with flaps. You can use it to slow down during a strafing run to put more rounds into the target. Also, if you've mapped different keys for small calibre and large calibre guns, the 7.7 mm machine guns will be recognized as small calibre and the 12.7 mm machine guns will be recognized as large calibre, and the guns will be able to fire separately. As for payload options, the 4 x 50 kg bombs are much more useful against the light ground targets you will see at this battle rating.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nAlthough the Ba.65 is an attacker, it can be used in an anti-fighter role with much success. The plane receives an air-spawn which invariably allows it a significant altitude advantage over enemy fighters. Boom & Zoom tactics, therefore, become very effective against slow, climbing, enemies. The Ba.65 has very good armament for its battle rating, and they will be enough to destroy any enemy fighter with one precise diving attack.\n\nOtherwise, the Ba.65 can also be used effectively in the intended ground attack role. Use its airspawn to gain speed in a dive and reach the target before enemy fighters arrive. Then, the plane's bomb load are able to take out armoured ground targets and its devastating frontal armament can kill many more lightly and non-armoured targets.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The aircraft was intended to perform a multitude of combat tasks ranging from conventional ground attack to intercepting hostile aircraft. However, due to many shortcomings of the Ba.65, it was later confined to pure ground support roles, and at the end of the war, converted to a trainer aircraft. Contrary to the positive first impressions that the aircraft left on its maiden flight in 1935, is the relative unpopularity among its crew due to the difficulties they faced while operating it.\n\nNevertheless, over 200 Ba.65 aircraft were built between 1935 and 1939. The aircraft fought on several theatres of war such as in Spain and North Africa, whilst some versions were also exported to Chile and Iraq.\n\n''- From the [[wt:en/news/4714-development-breda-ba-65-k14-the-sharp-eyed-hawk-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ba_65_k14_l Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Ne2Z_Tni-2U|'''(Arcade): {{PAGENAME}} - One of a Kind''' - ''tx141T''|M69_aNWR1HQ|'''Realistic: {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''Jengar''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* [[BB-1]]\n* [[Wirraway (Great Britain)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4714-development-breda-ba-65-k14-the-sharp-eyed-hawk-en|[Devblog] Breda Ba.65 K14: The Sharp-eyed Hawk]]\n* [[wikipedia:Breda_Ba.65|[Wikipedia] Breda Ba.65]]\n* [https://comandosupremo.com/breda-ba65/ <nowiki>[Comando Supremo]</nowiki> Breda Ba.65 Fighter-Bomber Aircraft]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Breda}}\n{{Italy strike aircraft}}"}}
