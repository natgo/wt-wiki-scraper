If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe best payload for base bombing is the 8 x 500 kg option, allowing you to take out two bases (requiring 4 bombs each). The 2 x 1,500 kg option is rarely recommended (except maybe when airfield bombing) as both bombs drop at once, limiting you to one base or target, and because the total bomb load is also reduced from 4,000 kg to 3,000 kg .\n\nA different approach is to select the airfield spawn (you spawn just above the runway) and the hug the ground, either attacking ground targets or bases (if there are any left). This has the advantage of meaning your team mates will be more likely to cover you (they don't have to climb up to your altitude), and makes you harder to spot for enemy aircraft. It also means enemy aircraft cannot get below you and exploit your blind spot. However you will likely be to slow to kill bases if there are any other bombers on your team (they will get their first). It is also not recommended to bomb the airfield at low altitude as you will be food for the AAA.\n\nKeep a constant lookout and use your potent defensive armament to dispatch of attacking enemy aircraft as quickly as possible.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Evaluation of the first prototype showed that the aircraft could be improved in some areas to achieve better performance. Thus, Beriev engineers equipped the following model, that would become the production version, with more powerful Shvetsov ASh-73 engines and changed the defensive armaments layout from six 12.7mm UBT machine guns to 23mm NR-23 cannons, followed by the reduction in turret count from 5 to 3. This improved variant had its maiden flight in 1951, with serial production following shortly after.\n\nAfter its introduction to service in 1951, the Be-6 was tasked with performing various roles fitted for a maritime aircraft, such as reconnaissance, sub-hunting, patrolling, transportation and mine-laying. The aircraft enjoyed a long service life thanks to the fact that significant changes within the Soviet navy, at least when float planes were concerned, were few and far between during the Cold War. However, the Be-6 didn't only serve with the Soviet Union. The Chinese also received a number of Be-6s for their naval air force. The Be-6 remained in active military service with the Soviet Union until the late 1960's, and up to the 1990's with the Chinese Naval Air Force, thanks to modernization efforts. The Chinese changed, among other things, the powerplant of the Be-6 to the WJ-6 turboprop and redesignated the Be-6 to the Qing-6. A total of around 120 Be-6s were produced between 1949 - 1957.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/4904-development-beriev-be-6-the-arctic-seagull-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=bomber&vehicle=be_6 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|QnDCpUfDnqY|'''Be-6 - For Bomber Enthusiasts Only - aka A Trolls Dream''' - ''Napalmratte''|XjXVbMFA3Bg|'''Be-6- All aboard!''' - ''Oxy''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4904-development-beriev-be-6-the-arctic-seagull-en|[Devblog] Beriev Be-6 - \"The Arctic Seagull\"]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/378373-be-6/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Beriev}}\n{{USSR bombers}}\n{{USSR premium aircraft}}"}}
