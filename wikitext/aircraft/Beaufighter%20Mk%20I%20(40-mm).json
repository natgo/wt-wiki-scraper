The 4th prototype, ''R2055'', was modified by replacing its standard armament with 2 40 mm guns. The gun mounted on the port fuselage was a Rolls-Royce BH, and the starboard fuselage gun was a Vickers S. The trials involving ''R2055'' eventually lead to the the development of an anti-tank Hawker Hurricane Mk IID, mounting 2 of the Vickers guns tested on the Beaufighter.<ref>Moyes 1966, pp. 5, 11, 13</ref> \n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=beaufighter_mk1_40mm Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7391-development-battle-pass-vehicles-beaufighter-mk-i-40-mm-en|[Devblog] Battle Pass Vehicles: Beaufighter Mk I (40-mm)]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Bristol}}\n{{Britain strike aircraft}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
