In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.53 \"Firestorm\"]]. It was a reward in the [[wt:en/news/3480--en|2015 Thunder League]] and later became available as a trophy chest reward in the [[Warbonds]] shop in [[wt:en/news/5432-news-how-can-you-get-premium-vehicles-warbonds-en|April 2018]], but is currently a rare vehicle that can only be obtained through the [[War Thunder Market|Marketplace]]. \n\nThe Bf 109 E-7 offers little difference from its historic predecessor, the [[Bf 109 E-4|Bf 109 E-4]], but is a model produced from the experience gained from the E-4. Notable differences include a newly designed aerodynamic propeller hub and additional bomb racks, the bomb racks also allowing the usage of drop tanks to extend its combat range.\n\nWhile essentially the same plane as the [[Bf 109 E-3]], the E-7 overcomes the inadequate MgFF for MgFF/M, featuring the fantastic 'minengeschoße'. With two wing-mounted [[MG FF (20 mm)]] with 60 rounds each, the plane has an even more deadly punch, attributed solely to the new installed HE-20mm-shell. Fighting in the E-7/U2 is essentially the same as with all E-frame 109s.\n\nRemaining a great energy fighter versus its historical opposition, the E-7 is somewhat troubled by the fact that it often faces mid-to-later war planes such as the [[P-47D-25]]. To engage these, make sure you have a clear energy advantage or, if attacked, fly defensively and attempt to bleed the enemies speed while pulling him down. The Bf 109 E-7/U2 is often not regarded as a good turner, a reputation coming out of the fact that its main rival, the [[Spitfire_(Family)|Spitfire]], simply did it better. However, especially with combat flaps, the E-7 is a respectable turner able to out turn most planes that outperform it. Keep in mind though that one of the changes from E-3 to E-7 increased the frame's weight. Flat turning should only be reserved for extreme situations.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:Cockpit_Bf109e3.jpg|x250px|thumb|right|Click to enlarge]]\nThe main armament is identical to that of the [[Bf 109 E-3]]. However, there is one critical difference. The [[MG FF (20 mm)|MgFF/M]] can fire 'minengeschoss' shells. Minengeschoss shells have a thin shell, allowing more incendiary material to be used; however the very same characteristics prevent these shells to be fired from older MG FF versions (like on the predecessor, E-3). Thus, the MGFF/Ms are far more powerful than the MG FFs.\n\nThe E-7 is able to load bombs, either 4 x 50 kg or 1 x 250 kg. Unless you like to fly at a severe disadvantage, do not use the bombs unless you have to in order to win a match - for example after refuelling/ restocking at the base. The bomb load is nowhere near big enough to make a fighter bombing trip worth it.\n\nThe DB 601N engine provides its maximum performance around 2,000 m to 5,000 m (6,500 ft to 16,500 ft respectively) and comes with WEP, providing +150 hp upon activation. The boost will last about one minute from normal operating temperatures.\n\n====Tactics====\n<!--Specific methods of play in different situations, label the methods with pros and cons (if possible) based on vehicle's performances (i.e. Me 262 playing as a fighter or anti-bomber)-->\nJust as the with the [[Bf 109 E-1]], new players should adopt a hit and run tactic with the Bf 109s. While often called Boom & Zoom aircraft, the 109s are not dedicated Boom & Zoomers and many other aircraft such as the [[Fw 190 A-1]] do it much better. While it is true that a pure Boom and Zooming approach can be used in the 109s, limiting oneself to this undermines ones plane efficiency enormously. That said, the 109s does build up speed fast in a dive and they have a respectable zoom climb that ends in a strong sustained climb at ~270 km/h [optimal climbing speed 260 km/h - 280 km/h]. Doing so will often see the player with the maximum speed or altitude advantage he can have over his chosen target. A straight-up bounce, with a short extend from the target and a slowly increasing climb leading into an Immelmann tends to work best for rookie pilots. Remember to check your six and surroundings during the climb and just before diving back on your target.\n\nWith mounting experience on the side of the player, the energy fighting abilities of the Bf 109 E-7/U2 come to the forefront. Fluid and speedy transitions between altitude and speed, together with well timed uses of flaps, throttle and manoeuvres enable the Emil to quickly change the nature of the engagement in its favour.\n\nWhen firing at enemies, be aware that your 20 mm cannons only hold a 60 round drum magazine each. They empty quick and many a new pilot has seen himself on pitiful low ammunition even after his first attack run. Once you emptied your cannons, the E-7 will be hard-pressed to down a plane with just the machine guns. In your own interest, do not waste your cannons on ground targets and when firing at planes, fire in short, controlled and well aimed bursts. Luckily, the E-7 holds 1000 rounds in each of its two [[MG 17 (7.92 mm)|MG 17]]s. Use these if you are inclined to spray and pray or are are about to engage ground targets.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!
