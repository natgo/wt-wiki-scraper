With a powerful engine and decent armament, the F-4 is an extremely powerful fighter in any hands. It is mainly a dogfighter, with a well-rounded mix of good climb rate, speed, manoeuvrability, and weaponry.\n\nAs the Bf 109 F-4 USA Premium comes with all upgrades, it is an extremely effective aircraft at purchase. Its main strengths lie in its astounding low-speed/mid-altitude climb rate. Use this to your advantage in a dogfight. Your opponents will be caught off guard when you rocket away at 25 m/s with your WEP. Compared to other aircraft at the same BR, the F-4 is more than able to take on most enemy aircraft.\n\nUnfortunately, for a premium plane, the F-4 isn't quite so stellar. It is relatively under-gunned, with only one 20mm cannon and two MGs. Pilots must be precise- as the single MG-151 will jam under intensive fire, even though the mods are all equipped.\n\nThe F-4 is also only average in its energy retention capabilities. Its redeeming feature for Boom & Zoom is its climb rate. It does have a relatively good turn rate but is also hampered by its lack of good energy retention. Stay in middle altitudes and dive and engage slower fighters. Avoid tangling with extremely manoeuvrable fighters such as the Yaks.\n\nThe F-4 performs poorly at high altitude. Do not try to chase planes above 4,000-5,000 m. In a dive, the F-4's wings will tear relatively quickly. Avoid diving at speeds above 800 km/h.\n\nOne could consider the F-4 a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. It has an average-to-good turn rate, decent weaponry, astounding climb rate, and poor energy retention.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Volkmann as the leader and Corporal A. Kuhn as the wingman, lost their bearings, ran out of fuel, and made a forced landing on a plot of arable land behind the front lines in the Chuguyev area. The Red Army thus obtained two Friedrichs in quite a good condition.\n\nThe fighter, with a serial number of 7690 and a yellow tail number reading \"12\" on the fuselage, was photographed from different angles and prepared for flight tests at the Red Army Air Force Research Institute.\n\nHowever, it soon became known that the captured Messerschmitt located in the USA had been damaged during flight, and the Allies requested that one of the two planes be transferred to them. General А. А. Novikov, Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army Air Force, gave permission to send the new Messerschmitt over the ocean.\n\nIn the USA, the Bf 109 F-4 (serial number 7690) successfully passed a complete set of flight tests. The aircraft received the USAAF's standard combat pattern and markings. Its tactical number at first was EB-1 and then EB-100.\n\nThe test results showed that the Bf 109 F-4 was 70 km/h quicker than the Bf 109E when near land; about one half of the velocity gain was obtained due to the more powerful DB 601E engine, while the other half was a result of better aerodynamics. The fighter's excellent controllability and good manoeuvrability were also noted.\n\nFavourable comments included those praising the plane's easily accessible engine components, especially its plugs, and its well-suited engine cowling. The fighter had various automatic devices, including those regulating water and oil temperature in the engine, which made the aircraft's piloting significantly easier.\n\nA thorough examination of the Bf 109 F-4 showed that the most vulnerable point of the fighter's power unit was the bottom of the engine. Even one shell or incendiary bullet hitting that area was enough to cause a fire. In addition, the Messerschmitt's water and oil coolers were not protected by armour, which turned them into a good target due to these units' large surface area. Two reserve cooling system tanks, mounted in the bottom of the engine, were also good targets.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=bf-109f-4_usa Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* North American [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]] Mustang\n* Kawasaki [[Ki-61 (Family)|Ki-61]]]\n* Fiat [[G.55 serie 1|G.55]]\n* Macchi [[C.205 serie 1|C.205]]\n\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/155545-messerschmitt-bf-109-f-4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer BFW}}\n{{USA fighters}}\n{{USA premium aircraft}}"}}
