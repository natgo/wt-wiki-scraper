In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nA very good energy fighter for its rank, the Bf 109 F-4 can out climb most opponents due to its high power to weight ratio. However, WEP must be limited or else the engine would overheat, although manual engine control can remedy this. Despite that, it can Boom & Zoom and Rope-a-Dope well although one must watch out for severe control stiffening around 650 km/h.\n\nUnfortunately, the F-4's 15 mm additional gondolas do not increase the damage output much at all while reducing flight performance. However, it is recommended you at least use it at least once to see how effective it is because depending on how you play it can really boost your firepower abilities. The 15 mm cannons are a trade-off for manoeuvrability, but this additional firepower can help rip the wings off anything you face . For example, if you prefer to get into a dogfight, the additional weaponry will not be noticeably effective. However, if you fight in the vertical, where level speed and agility is not necessarily the most important, the additional MG 151s can mean the difference between downing a plane or nothing at all.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that both guns will fire with each other until empty. The 20 mm cannon is mounted in the propeller shaft and fires through the propeller hub.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe tropical version is much like the [[Bf 109 F-4|standard F-4]] variant. New features are engine intake dust filter, a socket for sun-umbrellas and several other accommodations versus particulate matter. While these modifications allowed for prolonged service life in harsh environments like the Russian veld and Libya's desert, it also (marginally) costs top speed and engine performance due to increased air resistance and power diversion for the filtered aspirator, although these are hardly noticeable in combat.\n\nThe Bf 109 F-4 is not a great plane when you compare it to the other rank III planes, but it is effective nonetheless. Do not try to down a plane by coming behind it and giving them all you got, instead, try to scare your prey into a turn by peppering it with your 7.92 mm MG 17's, and then blow its wing off with the cannon. The cannon, unfortunately, fires relatively fast and runs out of ammo pretty quickly, so hitting a plane from the tail-end is hard to achieve.\n\nWord to the wise: the F-4 is a fairly good turner for its class; if you are chased by an [[F4U (Family)|F4U]], [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]], [[P-47 (Family)|P-47D]], or [[Typhoon Mk Ib/L|Typhoon]], turn and destroy. The forward wing slats give the F-4 an exceptionally short turning radius. However, to survive a tangle with a [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]] is an ordeal. The best strategy would be to scissor until the Spitfire either runs out of ammo or overshoots you, and then try to dive and outrun the Spitfire. Then, repeat. Do not try to out-climb the Spitfire (community nickname is a ''Spacefire'' for a reason), but try to outrun it in a dive. The [[Spitfire Mk Vc]] is superior to the F-4, avoid it.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was unique due to its air intake filter, hydraulic seals and protective covers. In addition, an umbrella was extendable over the cockpit to help keep the pilot from overheating when on the ground. The plane was equipped with a special emergency kit including a gun for self-defense and a supply of food and water.\n\nAlmost all of the Bf 109 F variants had tropical versions produced, but the Bf 109 F-4/trop was the most popular. Despite its name, the tropical variants were used not only in Africa but also on the southern steppe, where dust clouds were a significant threat to aircraft engines, as well as in the far north, where the filters protected the plane's engines from falling snow.\n\nA total of approximately 2,200 Bf 109 F's were constructed.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Mitsubishi [[A6M (Family)|A6M]]\n* Bell [[P-39 (Family)|P-39]] Airacobra\n* Curtiss [[P-36 (Family)|P-36]]\n* Curtiss [[P-40 (Family)|P-40]]\n* Dewoitine [[D.520]]\n* Fiat [[G.55 serie 1|G.55]]\n* Focke-Wulf [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]]\n* Grumman [[F4F (Family)|F4F]] Wildcat\n* Grumman [[F6F (Family)|F6F]] Hellcat\n* Hawker [[Hurricane (Family)|Hurricane]]\n* Heinkel [[He 112 (Family)|He 112]]\n* [[IAR-81C|IAR-81]]\n* Kawasaki [[Ki-61 (Family)|Ki-61]]\n* Lavochkin [[LaGG-3 (Family)|LaGG-3]]\n* Macchi [[C.202]]\n* Macchi [[C.205 serie 1|C.205]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-3 (Family)|MiG-3]]\n* Morane-Saulnier [[M.S.406C1|MS.406]]\n* Nakajima [[Ki-43 (Family)|Ki-43]]\n* North American [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]] Mustang\n* Polikarpov [[I-16 (Family)|I-16]]\n* Supermarine [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]]\n* Yakovlev [[Yak-1]]\n* Yakovlev [[Yak-9]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/316098-messerschmitt-bf-109-f-4trop/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer BFW}}\n{{Germany fighters}}"}}
