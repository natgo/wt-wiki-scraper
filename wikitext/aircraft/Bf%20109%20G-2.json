With these stock armaments it is all but a breeze to get on target offering little to no drop when firing. Ammunition conservation is not an issue but pilots may want to pay close attention to their 20 mm with its 200 rounds.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

The Bf 109 G-2 also comes with four 50 kg SC50JA bombs or a single 250 kg SC250JA bomb which both come in handy when destroying tanks, in tank RB.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Bf 109 G-2 is very similar in performance to the Bf 109 G-2/trop. The major difference between the two is the Bf 109 G-2 is faster than its brother but it offers little to no support when facing allied (USA, Britain, USSR, etc.) opponents. It turns better than most aircraft in its tier and holds energy very well.\n\nWhen used in battles it is best to climb to an altitude of 10,000 ft or more. Maintaining an energy advantage with this aircraft is the best tactic to maintain when in battle. The Bf 109 G-2 preforms extremely well at higher altitudes with the ability to outmanoeuvre most of its opponents. The Bf 109 G-2 is universal when it comes to a preferred flight characteristic but boom and zoom is preferred for the best results.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was used as a fighter, interceptor, high-altitude interceptor, fighter-bomber and reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nThe Bf 109 G \"Gustav\" was the most mass-produced variant of the 109, powered by the Daimler-Benz DB 605. The 605 was basically a DB 601 with the cylinder block redesigned to increase displacement from 33.9, to 35.7 liters - which resulted in 175 extra HP with no significant change in size. The Gustav also received improved armament. Instead of the previously standard 7.62mm MG 17 machine guns, 13mm MG 131 heavy machine guns were used. The heavier guns lead to distinct cowling bulges, needed to cover the breechblocks on the new guns.\n\nHowever, the increased equipment led to heavier weight on the Gustav, in fact 10% heavier than the Friedrich. Compared to the much earlier Bf 109B, the Gustav was almost 46% heavier. The new aircraft had begun to reach front-line units by May 1942. In essence, the Bf 109 design had reached its peak, and would ideally need to be replaced with newer, more modern designs. However, the troubled Me 209 replacement was still in development and things at the front were beginning to look ominous for Germany. Consequently, the RLM decided to continue to further refine the 109.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n=== Notable pilots ===\n[[File:Ilmari_Juutilainen_portrait.jpg|thumb|none|300px|link=User:U64962917#Juutilainen, Ilmari.|Finnish Air Force pilot [[User:U64962917#Juutilainen, Ilmari.|Ilmari Juutilainen]] transitioned from the Brewster Buffalo to the Bf 109 G-2 and felt that it was an extremely aggressive aircraft, one that helped him score 56 of his 94 kills including Soviet La-5 fighters which he felt were more agile than the 109.]]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n<div style=\"column-count:3;-moz-column-count:3;-webkit-column-count:3\">\n* Mitsubishi [[A6M (Family)|A6M]]\n* Bell [[P-39 (Family)|P-39]] Airacobra\n* Curtiss [[P-40 (Family)|P-40]]\n* Dewoitine [[D.520]]\n* Fiat [[G.55 serie 1|G.55]]\n* Focke-Wulf [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]]\n* Grumman [[F4F (Family)|F4F]] Wildcat\n* Grumman [[F6F (Family)|F6F]] Hellcat\n* Hawker [[Hurricane (Family)|Hurricane]]\n* [[IAR-81C|IAR-81]]\n* Kawasaki [[Ki-61 (Family)|Ki-61]]\n* Lavochkin [[LaGG-3 (Family)|LaGG-3]]\n* Macchi [[C.205 serie 1|C.205]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-3 (Family)|MiG-3]]\n* Morane-Saulnier [[M.S.406C1|MS.406]]\n* Nakajima [[Ki-43 (Family)|Ki-43]]\n* North American [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]] Mustang\n* Supermarine [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]]\n* Yakovlev [[Yak-9]]\n</div>\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/155556-messerschmitt-bf-109-g-2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer BFW}}\n{{Germany fighters}}\n{{Germany premium aircraft}}"}}
