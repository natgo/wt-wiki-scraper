It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/3071--en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.79 \"Project X\"]] and was removed from the Gaijin store after [[wt:en/news/5865-special-big-war-thunder-birthday-sale-en|War Thunder's 6th Anniversary sale]]. It was then made available briefly in the store during the [[wt:en/news/5976-special-shop-war-thunder-winter-sale-en|2018 Winter sale]] and for the [[wt:en/news/7710-special-maiden-flight-of-the-bf-109-en|2022 \"Maiden flight of the Bf 109\"]] event.\n\nThe Bf 109 \"Zwilling\" (German for \"twin\") is quite literally two BF 109 Fs assembled together. Featuring a quartet of the MK 108 Maschinenkanonen, also nicknamed \"Sledgehammer\" due to the firing sound, mounted in the middle of the plane, it is capable of shredding anything in its sights.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Zwilling shares similar characteristics to the American [[F-82E|F-82 ''Twin Mustang'']], which also so happens to be two of the same plane super-sized and put together. However, two of the main differences is the lack of two cockpits and two pilots and a significantly more powerful armament.\n\nWhile being significantly heavier, it is still a Messerschmitt and boasts an above-average manoeuvrability for a heavy fighter and high speed due to its twin DB 605's. However, it is significantly less manoeuvrable against single-engined props that it will face, so it is not recommended to turn fight unless they are considerably less manoeuvrable than you.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Bullet drop and slow velocity result in a severe difficulty leading shots at ranges above 300 m (350 yds). In dogfights where both aircraft are constantly turning and changing direction, this trait gets even worse. The high speeds of the late props push the necessary lead for hitting the target high and very far in front of the enemy. Training with this weapon system in a custom battle against random enemies is heavily advised.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|SC250JA (250 kg)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* Without load\n* 1 x 250 kg SC250JA bomb (250 kg total)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Zwilling sits at a rather uncomfortable spot as a heavy fighter, it's fast in a straight line and it climbs well, however the plane doesn't have much else going for it. You will only win a dogfight to an F-82, you will not stand a chance against single engined fighters and you have to reserve the plane to a very passive playstyle in order to capitalize on the pros of the plane. \n\nHowever, where the Zwilling really shines is as a bomber interceptor. The large bodies of bombers make it so that the MK 108's drop isn't as problematic, and the off-centre pilot makes it harder for their gunners to land a shot on your pilot. At the start of a match, climb to bomber altitude (4k-6k metres) and start hunting for prey. If all of the bombers have been destroyed, or there weren't any to begin with, you are safe to use it as a Boom-&-Zoomer or an air superiority fighter.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This means that the 109Z has one of the biggest spreads on any plane in the game (Could be seen as a pro for attacking bombers)\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

This sudden turn of events sparked an urgent demand for new heavy fighter and interceptor designs that would counter the ever increasing onslaught of allied bombers and their respective escorts. Although the Messerschmitt company was already working on such a new aircraft that would replace the dated Bf 110 - the Me 210 - several problems during development delayed the project's completion. As a result, new versions of the Bf 110 had to be developed to counter the new threat. However, the RLM (German Air Ministry) wasn't content with the creation of even more modifications of the aircraft as they planned to decrease the amount of different variants for all aircraft in service at the time in hopes of addressing logistical problems that strained production. Inspired by the previous He-111 \"Zwilling\" project, Messerschmitt engineers began work on a similar alternative heavy fighter based on the Bf 109, that could easily be mass produced and offer better performance (in reference speed) than the Bf 110 already in service, whilst at the same time being cheaper to manufacture than newly designed machines.\n\nBy taking two standard Bf 109Fs from the assembly line and \"welding\" them together, Messerschmitt engineers created what would become known as the Bf 109Z-0 - the first prototype of the \"zwilling\" Bf 109. In 1943 however, a bombing raid of one of the Messerschmitt plants near Augsburg led to the destruction of the prototype, cancelling the planned tests. Despite this setback, the engineers kept working on the concept and less than a year later, in spring 1944, a new Z-1 prototype, based off the Bf 109G-6, was created. The second prototype differed from the first one, apart from being based on a later variant of the 109, in the abandoning of rifle-calibre guns in favor of interchangeable large-calibre autocannons, a common trend for late-war German machines. In the end, the project was ultimately cancelled as resource shortages began afflicting the German industry in the final stages of the war and the concept of a twin Bf 109 fighter was abandoned for good.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5534-development-messerschmitt-bf-109z-the-teutonic-twin-boom-terror-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=bf-109z Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|INb9VjLxKf0|'''Most unusual aircraft''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 0:34 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[F-82E]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5534-development-messerschmitt-bf-109z-the-teutonic-twin-boom-terror-en|[Devblog] Messerschmitt Bf 109Z: The Teutonic Twin-Boom Terror]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/414734-bf109z/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Messerschmitt_Bf_109_variants|[Wikipedia] Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer BFW}}\n{{Germany twin-engine fighters}}\n{{Germany premium aircraft}}"}}
