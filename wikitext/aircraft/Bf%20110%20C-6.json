The 30 mm chin-mounted cannon can load both HVAP and HE rounds giving it flexibility in both Air RB and Ground RB. The Bf 110 C-6 can intercept bombers, destroy tanks and pillboxes with its 30 mm cannon but struggles in dogfights with fighters unless it had the altitude/energy advantage. The lack of 20 mm cannons leaves the C-6 nothing to fall back on except four machine guns. The C-6 is a great ground attacker in ground battles as the 30 mm cannon can penetrate most tanks at its rank.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This modification came into existence in the spring of 1939. The aircraft was designed to be equipped with a 30mm MK 101 cannon, while its standard-issue 20mm cannons were dismantled for the purposes of reducing the weight and increasing fuselage space. A series of issues concerning the manufacturing of the MK 101 cannons led to the postponement of the project, but in the summer of 1940, the German government placed an order to assemble a test batch consisting of 12 C-6 aircraft. All the fighters in this batch were deployed in the Battle of France as anti-tank aircraft, as well as in the Battle of Britain to combat enemy ships and destroy enemy radars.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6296/current|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Images\n\n[[File:Bf 110 C-6 WTWallpaper 001.jpg|thumb|none|300px]]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|AW9Gjrax8Zg|'''The Shooting Range #53''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:07 discusses the Bf 110.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6296/current|[Development] Bf 110C-6: The Devourer of Ground Units]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/458558-bf-110-c6/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer BFW}}\n{{Germany strike aircraft}}\n{{Germany premium aircraft}}"}}
