It can withstand hits of up to 20 mm calibre cannons without problems, obviously depending on where it is hit, for example if it is hit the engines or tanks, let's say that it will not resist much because they are critical points of the aircraft. The level of survival is also very good, the \"vital\" area of the aircraft is all in the middle, fuel tanks and crew.

The 30 mm belts contain mainly HEI-T and I rounds, which cause severe damage to enemy aircraft and open-topped ground vehicles, while the MG 151 belts are very good for destroying enemy aircraft and light vehicles.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers.

The two MG 151s are super effective to fight other aircraft for example in frontal attacks or to cause serious damage to bombers. With these two additional cannons you will be able to perform an important task of air superiority, but thanks to these 20 mm you will also be able to do a great job as CAS. With the two 500 kg bombs feel free to use them as you wish, you can use them against everything, from bombing bases, to bombing ships and tanks. You can even use them to get an enemy off your tail by going low to the ground and dropping them, the 500 kg bomb is powerful enough to do critical damage to light aircraft following you.\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use.

The best belt to use is AP-T, with two AP-I and two AP-T rounds.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:Bf 110 G-4 (Italy) in a dive.png|thumb|Nosedive on two panthers]]\nThe Bf 110 G-4 is an excellent aircraft to perform almost any task. It can be used to defend allied bombers, or it can simply act as a support aircraft thanks to its two rear machine guns. It is an excellent aircraft to destroy ground targets and provide cover for allied tanks, but it can also be used as a heavy fighter and thus provide air superiority in a very effective way, if accompanied by some fighters. It is recommended to use it according to the needs of the team. If the squadron needs more of a CAS aircraft, the various payload options allow it to perform the task as a CAS aircraft, if bombers need cover then do not equip external payload and gain the necessary altitude to fight. It is a very versatile aircraft to play.\n\n===Radars===\n{{main|FuG-220}}\n\nThe Bf 110 G-4 is equipped with a [[FuG-220]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft; a control box which is part of the radar damage model is located behind the pilot.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[FuG-220]] - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Guaranteed<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, detection of a target is practically guaranteed}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n|-\n| 5,000 m || 5,000 m || ±35° || -55°/+20°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The Bf 110 had several variants including:\n\n* Bf 110 A\n* Bf 110 B\n* Bf 110 C ([[Bf 110 C-6]], [[Bf 110 C-7]])\n* Bf 110 D\n* Bf 110 E\n* Bf 110 F ([[Bf 110 F-2]])\n* Bf 110 G ([[Bf 110 G-2]], [[Bf 110 G-4]])\n* Bf 110 H\n\n[[File:Bf 110 G-4 (Italy) close up.png|thumb|The Bf 110 G-4 seen from the front]]\nThe Messerschmitt Bf 110 G entered service in May 1942 and was characterized, compared to the previous versions, by the adoption of two 1,475 hp Daimler Benz DB 605 engines capable of allowing the aircraft to reach a speed of 595 km/h. In particular the G-4 version assumed the role of heavy night fighter with the task of countering the Allied bombers' incursions in the skies over Germany. Heavily armed, thanks also to the possibility of installing a gun pod with two [[MK 108 (30 mm)|MK 108 30 mm]] cannons, and equipped with a [[FuG-202|FuG-202 radar system]] optimized for night hunting, it became a valid adversary of the British [[Lancaster B Mk I|Lancaster]] bombers or the American [[B-17 (Family)|B-17]] \"Flying Fortresses\".\n\nBf 110s were withdrawn from service at the end of World War II in 1945.\n\n=== Hungary ===\nHungarian Air Force in December 1944 received at least 6 Bf 110 G-4s, later assigned to a night fighter squadron based at Veszprém, not much is known about their service.\n\n=== Italy ===\nThe Regia Aeronautica in July 18, 1942 requested Bf 110s from the Luftwaffe to defend Milan and northern cities from Allied bombers. But eventually it received some Bf 110 C-3s which were assigned to the 235a Squadriglia del 41°Stormo B.T., after the formation of the RSI, the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana (ANR) received in the spring of 1944 two Bf 110 G-4/R3 assigned then to the 170a Squadriglia caccia notturna.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=bf_110g_4_hungary Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/497246-bf-110g-4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer BFW}}\n{{Italy strike aircraft}}\n{{Italy premium aircraft}}"}}
