If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis plane plays mostly like [[Bf 110 G-2|its predecessor]], but it has the added bonus of a search radar and a pair of upwards firing MG 151 cannons. This plane is also slightly slower and climbs worse due to the drag of the search radar and the extra radar operator. A strategy for experienced pilots is to turn the plane upside down and use the upwards firing guns to strafe ground targets, just remember to pull up in time! This plane is like a fusion between the [[Bf 110 G-2]] and the [[Do 217 N-2]]. You can use strategies used on both planes on this aircraft but less effectively. Watch out for enemies that can out-turn you, have a better climb than you, or if there are a horde of them.\n\n=== Radars ===\n{{main|FuG-220}}\n\nThe Bf 110 G-4 is equipped with a [[FuG-220]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft; a control box which is part of the radar damage model is located behind the pilot.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[FuG-220]] - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Guaranteed<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, detection of a target is practically guaranteed}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n|-\n| 5,000 m || 5,000 m || ±35° || -55°/+20°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!
