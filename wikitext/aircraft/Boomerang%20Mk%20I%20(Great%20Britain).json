From this, it would be thought that the Boomerang isn't much of a capable fighter, as most of its opponents are capable of reaching 500 km/h at any altitude, yet the Boomerang possesses great manoeuvrability.\n\nTherefore, the Boomerang is best played in a turn-fighting role, almost as a British A6M, as even though the statistics claim a rather average turn time, at low altitude it is a turning-monster, capable of competing with even some Japanese fighters.\n\nThe armament of the Boomerang is also quite acceptable for its rank, with 2 x 20 mm Hispano cannons and 4 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, which also emphasises its turn-fighting role. However, Boom and Zoom tactics are also possible with the Boomerang, as its decent rip speed, lack of rudder-stiffness at high speed and good rate of climb allows it to make decent passes on any enemies unfortunate enough to be underneath it.\n\nThe Boomerang also possesses a good roll rate, which can help perform aerial manoeuvres faster.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Designed to equip the RAAF after the start of the Second World War, the aircraft was the first indigenously-built Australian fighter aircraft. The Boomerang was very underpowered due to the limited engine choices, meaning that it was considerably slower than its contemporaries. The aircraft saw limited active service during the Second World War in both frontline and secondary duties.\n\nIn the late 1930s, with Nazi Germany and Japan both rapidly increasing the size of their militaries, the Australian Air Force (RAAF) looked to acquire a new fighter aircraft to replace their obsolete squadrons of F2A Buffalos. Following the start of the war, the RAAF was hard-pressed for fighters: the UK, Australia’s primary source for aircraft, was barely supplying enough aircraft for itself, while the USA dedicated almost all of its manufacturing capacity to producing aircraft for the USAAF and USN. As a result, Australia was forced to produce a new fighter indigenously.\n\nThe RAAF turned to the CAC, which had been created in 1936 through the merger of several Australian aircraft companies. The CAC was already producing the Wirraway, a training and general-purpose aircraft; the CAC decided to create a new fighter on the basis of the Wirraway, as this could be done quickly and efficiently. The Wirraway's rear fuselage, tail and wings were mated to a new forward fuselage which housed a 1,200 hp Pratt & Whitney twin wasp engine. This prototype configuration first flew in May of 1942 and was later ordered into service as the Boomerang Mark I (contract number CA-12) - a total of 105 Boomerang Mk Is would be built during the war.\n\nIn service, the Boomerang proved to be very underpowered and much slower than most comparable allied fighters. In fact, the Boomerang never shot down a single enemy aircraft. The Boomerang proved to be more effective as a ground attack aircraft, replacing the lighter-armed Wirraway in this role: it was frequently used to drop ordnance or strafe enemy targets, or deploy smoke bombs to mark enemy targets. The Boomerang was retired soon after the war’s end; five Boomerang Mk Is remain intact today, including two currently-airworthy aircraft.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe CAC Boomerang was an Australian single-seat, single-engine fighter of mixed wood and aluminium construction.\n\nThe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour on December 7, 1941 and subsequent events in the Pacific theatre of operations showed how unready Australia was for war. The country had fewer than two hundred military aircraft, most of them obsolete. At that time, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) only produced a trainer, the CAC Wirraway (a licensed version of the American NA-33). The License Agreement provided for modifications, so, in order to have fighter aircraft as soon as possible, the CAC decided to use the trainer as a basis for a new fighter.\n\nThe CA-12 (later called the Boomerang Mk.I) was created, the first domestically produced fighter to ever roll off Australian assembly lines. The CA-12 borrowed the Wirraway's landing gear, tail, and wing design and was powered by a license built American Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp engine, rated at 1,200 hp. The aircraft was armed with two 20 mm Hispano cannon and four 0.303 inch Browning machine guns and could carry four 9kg smoke bombs to mark targets, one 227kg bomb, or a 265 litre external fuel tank.\n\nThe CA-12 had high durability, good armament, and excellent handling characteristics at low level, although this performance deteriorated at height and the fighter's top speed was not at all competitive.\n\nMass production began in July 1942 and 105 Boomerang Mk I fighters were produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=boomerang_mki Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|mJO2sLI_jwU|'''The Shooting Range #19''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 00:46 discusses the CAC Boomerang.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/195733-commonwealth-aircraft-corporation-boomerang-mk-i/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Commonwealth}}\n{{Britain fighters}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
