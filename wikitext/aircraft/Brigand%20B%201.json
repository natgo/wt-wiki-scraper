In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.63 \"Desert Hunters\"]].\n\nThis plane is a pure bomber hunter and ground attack aircraft. If there are no bombers for you to hunt, switch to heading on fighters. Should you survive to late match and find that the tickets will decide the match then you may load up air-to-ground weapons, but not before that.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIn AB and RB, you should immediately bomber hunt, as those will be your easiest kills, combined with your bomber altitude, you should stay high until you run out of targets to engage then you should go for injured fighters and ground targets. When diving, use your airbrakes to be sure not to exceed your maximum speed in a dive.\n\n'''How to offensively engage an enemy aircraft:'''<br>\nThe first thing you should do is head on. Your four Hispano guns will completely obliterate any aircraft from the front with a 3-second burst. In your head on you should open fire as far out as you feel comfortable, then turn out immediately after you hit him, as you don't want him to change direction until after your volley hits home.\n\n'''How to perform defensive fighting:'''<br>\nShould an enemy get on your six, your best bet is to bolt towards allied fighters/airfield and give the enemy a hard time aiming at you. While moving in the same general direction, dart your nose around and play with the roll, rudder and rise, if you are lucky he'll either overshoot, run out of ammo, or get shot down. Under no circumstance should you ever turn fight anything smaller than a medium bomber, otherwise you will bleed off your speed or the attacker will out turn you and acquire a firing solution.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Because of this, the Brigand was substantially larger than its predecessor and its performance suffered in suit. Originally conceived as a fast torpedo attacker, the Brigand turned out to be a heavy strike bomber, and only the first eleven airframes were ever torpedo capable.\n\nThe Brigand B.1 as seen in-game would first see service with No. 84 and No. 8 Sqn RAF in Aden, modern-day Yemen. While not seeing action, the hot, dry climate of the Arabian peninsula was ideal for the Brigand and production continued. The Brigand would next be handed over to Beaufighter squadron No. 45 based out of Tengah, Singapore in engaging Communist guerillas in and around Malaya (Modern day Malaysia). It was here where the Brigand would receive its trial of fire, bombing and rocketing swathes of the South-East Asian jungles on the hunt for this red menace. However, the humid climate and constant stress from dive bombing would be the death sentence for this aircraft. The leather and rubber seals used on the hydraulic jacks of the landing gear and dive brakes rotted away, causing gear failures and some dive brakes failing, leading to crashes and wing tearing. This, combined with the Brigand's wings being unable to cope with the constant dive-bombing, led to it being withdrawn from service in Malaya by 1952, and from Aden by 1954.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=brigand_b1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|gSun_ErSSJA|'''The Shooting Range #304''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:30 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|qMGtikpns6M|'''Brigand - (Not So Bad) First Impressions''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/331470-brigand-b-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Bristol}}\n{{Britain bombers}}"}}
