It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]].\n\nThe C.205N, also known as the \"Orione\" (\"Orion\"), was a development of the [[C.205_serie_3|C.205V \"Veltro\"]] to bring more firepower and higher altitude into the aircraft's performance.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

A single 20 mm cannon is mounted in the nose of the aircraft, firing through the propeller hub. The two machine guns are nose mounted, positioned between the pilot and the engine of the aircraft. If fired continuously, the wing mounted cannons will run out of ammunition before the nose-mounted cannon.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe C.205N2 belongs to the select few planes who are good for [[Boom & Zoom|Boom and Zoom]] as well as turnfighting, it is an extremely balanced multi-role aircraft. It should be played neither at low altitude nor at high altitude, but in-between at medium altitude. It has no problem dealing with all other fighters at its BR, due to its ability to retain energy well. It can hold its own against [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109s]], [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190s]] and [[P-51 (Family)|P-51s]]. It can fight well against [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]] (with some skill on the pilot's part).\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

To achieve this, the engineers made the fuselage longer and increased the wingspan of the aircraft and in the second prototype they have adapted the fuselage for a 20 mm cannon within the engine shaft.\n[[File:C.205N2.png|thumb|C.205N2 (MM.500) on the airfield]]\nThe first prototype C.205N1 (MM.499) flew on 1 November 1942 by Guido Carestiato to be later sent to Guidonia Experimental Centre for official evaluation in a fighter competition. After it, the Macchi engineers built the second variant: the [[C.205N2]] (MM.500) was flown 19 May 1943 by Lonate Pozzolo, later also flying to Guidonia for military  acceptance testing.\n\nThe first prototype C.205N1 was not accepted because the armament was not compliance with official specifications by the Tender Committee, the Macchi C.205N1 armament was armed with one 20 mm [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151/20]] cannon mounted in the fuselage and firing through the hollow hub of the propeller, and four [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT]] machine guns. Meanwhile, the [[C.205N2]] has a pair of wing-mounted 20 mm [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151/20]] cannons instead of the original  [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT]] machine guns and a 20 mm [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151/20]] cannon within the engine block.\n\nHowever, as the war in the Mediterranean was drawing to a close and resources dwindling, the project failed to influence the outcome of the war as it never left prototype stage.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=mc-205_n2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"150\">\nImage:C.205N2 Destroying an American B-17.png|<small>C.205N2 Destroying an American B-17</small>\nImage:C.205N2 Formation (1).png|<small>C.205N2 in formation</small>\nImage:C.205N2 Formation (2).png|<small>C.205N2 in formation</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|wDxhzDnCnHY|'''The Shooting Range #111''' - ''War Machines'' section at 05:25 discusses the C.205N2.|ih6xhSZlTgQ|'''The Shooting Range #78''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 10:44 discusses the C.205N.|DwbexTKZA-A|'''The Shooting Range #49''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 07:02 discusses the C.205.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[G.55 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4817-vehicle-profile-macchi-c-205n2-orione-rome-s-shooting-star-en|[Vehicle Profile] Macchi C.205N2 Orione - \"Rome's Shooting Star\"]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/365074-macchi-c205-n2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Macchi}}\n{{Italy fighters}}"}}
