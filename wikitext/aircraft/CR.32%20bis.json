It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]], along with the Italian aviation tree as a pre-order [[wt:en/news/4671-italian-aircraft-in-war-thunder-update-1-69-regia-aeronautica-en|premium pack]] prior to the update that also allowed access into the Italian Closed Beta Test. It was removed after the [[wt:en/news/5079-special-hurry-up-and-get-rare-packs-en|5th Anniversary sale]] but came back in the [[Warbonds]] shop as part of the first trophy chest in [[wt:en/news/5432-news-how-can-you-get-premium-vehicles-warbonds-en|April 2018]] until the end of [[Battle Pass: Season IV, \"Fearless Voltigeur\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nBeing essentially an upgunned reserve plane, the CR.32 bis' flight performance leaves much to be desired. While it can outturn most monoplane fighters, the CR.32 bis will occasionally struggle to dogfight against most of biplanes (especially the [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]] series). Its slow top speed and very poor energy retention also restricting its dogfight capabilities.\n\nOn the plus side, the CR.32 bis retain its great diving speed of its reserve counterparts, coupled with increased performance at higher speed, this makes it very excel at boom-and-zoom tactics, capable of strafing enemy from above before retreating.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,100 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 2 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, nose-mounted (350 rpg = 700 total)\n* 2 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, wing-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)\n\nThe main (and only) difference between the CR.32 bis and its reserve counterparts is the addition of two 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns mounted on the wings. These guns provided extra firepower at close range, thought you might need to set convergence due to wing-mounted setup.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe CR.32 bis is virtually similar to its reserve counterpart, the [[CR.32]] with the exception of 2 additional 7.7 mm machine guns. While these machine guns provided extra kick to the opponents, the CR.32 bis will have to face much faster and stronger opponents: monoplane fighers and bombers. Furthermore, its already mediocre top speed is now considered terrible at its BR. This means you have to be more careful when engaging targets.\n\nWith a top level speed of only 380 km/h, the CR.32 bis will be usually outrun by most opponents it face. Instead, climb to higher altitude, then use its surprisingly fast dive speed to execute boom-and-zoom attack to kill an unsuspecting opponents. While it can dogfight against monoplanes to some extent, the CR.32 bis' poor energy retention will eventually catch up and slow down the plane significantly, be decisive and strike at enemy weak points (engines, pilot, etc.) to finish them off as fast as possible.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Good offensive capabilities\n** 12.7 mm MGs are great for knocking out pilots and penetrating enemy armour plates\n** 7.7 mm MGs provided extra firepower at close range and can be used to strafe soft targets\n* Excellent dive speed\n** Excellent high-speed performance\n* Surprisingly good turning against monoplane fighters\n* Fixed gear makes it easy to land\n* Durable airframe for a biplane\n** Effective self-sealing fuel tanks\n* In Simulator it almost never spins, allowing some really tight manoeuvres to be performed without danger\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Overall mediocre flight performance\n** Sluggish top speed\n** Turns worse than some biplanes it faces\n** Poor roll rate for a biplane\n** Terrible energy retention, will lose a lot of energy while turning\n** Fixed gear increases drag\n* No protection for the pilot\n* Uses a telescopic gunsight which is extremely hard to use in Simulator\n* Upper wing greatly obstructs the upward-forward view, a disadvantage in a Simulator dogfight\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
