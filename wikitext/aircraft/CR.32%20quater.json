In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]].\n\nThe C.R.32 quater fights are usually at low to medium altitude, the recommended fight altitude is around 1,000 to 3,000 m. Flying above ground level gives you the advantage of diving on your enemies, and you can also dive to avoid incoming fighters.\n\nFor a reserve plane, it is one of the best. It does lack armour for the pilot, meaning new players should focus on increasing the pilot's vitality. Its 2 x 12.7 mm (.50 cal) guns are one of the most powerful armaments in reserve planes, just behind the [[Ba.65 (K.14) L]].\n\nIt has plenty of ammo, 350 rpg, which is enough to kill at least 2 planes. Its armament is also enough to kill a pilot in a single hit, which is similar to the [[P-26 (Family)|P-26 ''Peashooter'']]. It does, however, trade some manoeuvrability for superb diving capability. It can not turn fight [[Ki-10 (Family)|Ki-10s]], [[I-15 (Family)|I-15s]] and is comparable to a [[Fury Mk II]]. It can fight pretty much anything it faces, but sometimes needs the help of a teammate.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe CR.32 Quater does not have a real playstyle that differs much from other biplanes. Compared to the Soviet and German biplanes, it is slightly less manoeuvrable because it has a little more structural resistance, this also means that it is able to absorb many more shots during fights. Its increased resistance allows it to absorb many hits from 12.7 mm MGs without causing too much damage to the aircraft. In these cases, each player is free to use the aircraft as he likes, being a biplane it is difficult to differentiate it from the others, but use it in pairs or in groups when possible because its slowness is a disadvantage in solo fights. \n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The CR.32 quater was used by Italy, Hungary, Venezuela and Paraguay and sub-variants were created:\n\n* CR.32 quater CN\n* CR.32 quater AS (variant capable of carrying bombs and fight in desert conditions, the drop load, consist bombs or stick bombs up to 100 Kg)\n\n'''Italy'''\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out, the [[CR.32]] was already obsolete (and eventually replaced by the [[CR.42]]) but, in spite of that, it still equipped several fighter units.\n\nBy 10 June 1940 the CR.32 was equipped for the following Gruppi Caccia (Fighters Groups): 24Â°Gruppo (52Â°Stormo) at Sarzana, 2Â°Gruppo at Grottaglie, 157Â°Gruppo (1Â°Stormo) at Trapani, 9Â°Gruppo at Monserrato, 160Â° at Tirana, 13Â°Gruppo (Partly) at Castelbenito (Libya), 8Â°Gruppo at Tobruk, 10Â°Gruppo at Benina and 163Â° Squadron at Rhodes.\n\nThe CR.32 quater having been involved in military operations were those stationed in Libya, forty-odd machines being used mostly in ground attack missions together with the 50Â°Stormo's Breda 65s.\n\nThe other front where the machine was used to the last example was Eastern Africa, fighting highly superior machines, such as Blenheims and Hurricanes. The CR.32 quater closely followed the alternate phases of the campaign, from Italian advance into Egypt to the loss of Cyrenaica, they were widely used fairly successfully with various bomb types until January 1941. After the conquest of Crete in May 1941, [[CR.32 (Family)|CR.32s]] were relegated to fighting training duties.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=cr_32_quater Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"150\">\nFile:CR.32 quater banking left.png|<small>Front view of the CR.32 Quater</small>\nFile:CR.32 quater over Italian city.png|<small>Overflying Italy in war</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|iQs0VuHMaFA|'''The Shooting Range #45''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:08 discusses the CR.32.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Fiat}}\n{{Italy fighters}}"}}
