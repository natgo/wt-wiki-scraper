However, the most deadly thing about the CR.32 is its twin 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns. Equipped with air targets belt, it can easily set other planes on fire. The only downsides of the plane are the lack of protection and speed. The recommended tactic is to always have an altitude advantage over your enemies. Do not turn too much and fire your machine gun in bursts as you have limited ammo.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This plane was designated with serial number MM 201.\n\nTested at Montecelio, the CR.30 (MM 201), later named CR.32, demonstrated as a perfect fighter and was the perfect conception of Italian fighter biplanes with a balance of manoeuvrability, performance, and military efficiency.\n\nIn the mid thirties, the CR.32 was ordered by Regia Aeronautica, quickly replacing the CR.30, after which it was ordered by other nations.\n\nThe CR.32 was used by Italy, China, Spain, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Venezuela and Paraguay.\n\nAfter the CR.32, other variants were created:\n\n* CR.32 Bis\n* CR.32 ter\n* CR.32 Quater\n** CR.32 Quater CN\n** CR.32 Quater AS\n* CR.32 Serie 2\n\n'''Italy'''\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out, the CR.32 was already obsolete (and eventually replaced by the CR.42) but, in spite of that, it still equipped several fighter units.\n\nBy 10 June 1940 the CR.32 was equipped for the following Gruppi Caccia (Fighters Groups): 24°Gruppo (52°Stormo) at Sarzana, 2°Gruppo at Grottaglie, 157°Gruppo (1°Stormo) at Trapani, 9°Gruppo at Monserrato, 160° at Tirana, 13°Gruppo (Partly) at Castelbenito (Libya), 8°Gruppo at Tobruk, 10°Gruppo at Benina and 163° Squadron at Rhodes.\n\nThe first CR.32 to have been involved in military operations were those stationed in Libya, forty-odd machines being used mostly in ground attack missions together with the 50°Stormo's Breda 65s.\n\nThe other front where the machine was used to the last example was Eastern Africa, fighting highly superior machines, such as [[Blenheim Mk IV|Blenheims]] and [[Hurricane (Family)|Hurricanes]].\n\nThe old biplane closely followed the alternate phases of the campaign, from Italian advance into Egypt to the loss of Cyrenaica, they were widely used fairly successfully with various bomb types until January 1941.\n\nAfter the conquest of Crete in May 1941, CR.32s were relegated to fighting training duties.\n\n'''Aerobatic Teams'''\n\nThe CR.32 with these characteristics was used by Aerobatic Teams from 1936 to 1939 in various aeronautic events.\n\nThe 4°Stormo was first in exhibiting in 1936 in Rome with a ten-machine patrol. 1936 also marked the rebirth of 6°Stormo Caccia, equipped with CR.32s, which soon established an aerobatic patrol of its own at its bases at Campoformido and Gorizia.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1939 the Aerobatic Teams did aeronautic events in Budapest, Zurich, Perù, Chile, Argentine, Brazil, and finally Berlin.\n\n'''Spanish Civil War'''\n\nThe CR.32 had its baptism of fire in the Spanish skies, the first twelve machines arrived by steamer at Melilla, Morocco, on 14 August 1936 and, together with the nine SIAI SM.81 arrived on 28 July, were incorporated into l'Aviacion de el Tercio. At the end of August, after further batches of CR.32s had arrived, the \"Cucaracha\" squadron was established at Cacéres, late to became the XVI Gruppo Caccia.\n\nIn April 1937, the XVI Gruppo were joined by XXIII Gruppo \"Asso di Bastoni\" and VI Gruppo \"Gamba di Ferro\", after CR.32 was used by X Gruppo Caccia \"Baleari\" and the Squadron \"Frecce\".\n\nThanks to the CR.32, the Legion's fighters quickly established supremacy over the red air forces, but in November a new fighter, the Polikarpov I-15, appeared and the battles with CR.32 were harder to win. After came the I-16, much faster than the CR.32, and the pilots of CR.32 were unable to fully exploit all the capabilities of their mounts and to follow the dog-fighting manoeuvres imposed by the nimbler FIAT biplane.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=cr_32 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|iQs0VuHMaFA|'''The Shooting Range #45''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:08 discusses the CR.32.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4670-development-fiat-cr-32-the-spanish-cricket-en|[Devblog] Fiat CR.32: The Spanish Cricket]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Fiat}}\n{{Italy fighters}}"}}
