In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British jet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.45 \"Steel Generals\"]].\n\nThe Canberra B (I) Mk 6 is an interdiction model of the famous bomber, thus it is more suited for aggressive ground attack/interdiction roles by comparison to the B Mk.2 or B-57A models. Much like the B-57B, it retains its bomb carrying capabilities, but also features and impressive battery of armament consisting of 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk V cannons. Not only this, but the B (I) Mk 6 has a 2,000-round capacity for these cannons, making it a truly formidable attack aircraft and also allowing for air-to-air combat with other aircraft. Unlike the previous B Mk.2 model, due to the inclusion of a gun pack to house the cannon armament, the B (I) Mk 6 features wing mounted pylons to carry similar ordnance options to the previous model of Canberra. This makes the B (I) one of the most effective and versatile attack aircraft in game due to its ability to switch from conventional bombing, to ground attack and also interception.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Canberra B (I) Mk 6 can be played a few different ways. You can bomb the bombing targets as a bomber, but then you can use the plane to its full potential as a heavy fighter. The Canberra rolls decently when slow, but when you start to turn, the elevator will pull and the plane has a decent turning circle for its size. The 4 x Hispano Mk.V cannons are decently easy to aim as they are mounted on the underbelly of the aircraft. You have 2,000 rounds of ammunition which can easily deal with multiple targets with plenty of ammo to spare. The best way to play this aircraft is Boom and Zooming, where you dive on a target and have a gun run on them and after the run is over pulling off and going back up using your speed for altitude. The aircraft gets a bomber spawn which will spawn you at a high altitude and decent speed at the start of the match.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nAfter the runaway success of the first English Electric Canberra variants, further development was an inevitability. A single Canberra B Mk.5 was constructed as a test bed of marrying the airframe with the new, more powerful Rolls-Royce Avon RA7 jet engines with a lengthened fuselage leading to a greater fuel capacity. Trials proved to be successful and the resulting Canberra B Mk.6 entered service with the RAF in 1954.\n\nThe B Mk.6 was some 10 mph faster and also saw a range increase from approximately 2,600 miles to just under 3,400 miles, significantly improving flexibility of operations for RAF Bomber Command.\n\nThe B Mk.6 also spawned the development of the interim B(I) Mk.6, which added a ventral pack containing four 20 mm Hispano cannon and an additional two hard points on the wings for external stores. It also included the Low Altitude Bombing System for the release of nuclear weapons in a climb from low altitude.\n\nThe Canberra saw service with both the RAF, RNZAF and RAAF during the Malayan Emergency. RAF Canberra B Mk.6's also served alongside the earlier B Mk.2 and Photographic Reconnaissance variants during the Suez Crisis in 1956.\n\nWhilst the Canberra was phased out of service as an RAF front line bomber in the early 1960s it continued to be used for a staggering 50 years in other roles, particularly photographic reconnaissance, and even flew operationally in the 1991 Gulf War. It finally retired from service with the RAF in June 2006. The Canberra saw great success across a number of variants and was exporting to many countries such as Australia, the United States, France, India, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, West Germany, Venezuela, Sweden, South Africa, Rhodesia, Zimbabwe, Peru, Ecuador and Ethiopia.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=canberra_bimk6 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer EEC}}\n{{Britain jet aircraft}}"}}
