If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nClimbing high to around 10 kilometres will save you from most predators and AA fire in both AB and RB as the Canberra has one of the best climb rates and high-alt performances in the game. Watch out for the [[Me 163 B|Me 163]] and [[Ki-200]], who can climb to you easily thanks to their Rocket Engines. A common strategy by Canberras (and B-57s, as they are the same airframe) is to head to one base, drop all payload on such base and then running for their lives. Using the 6 x 1,000 lb payload is recommended for usage on bases while 1 x 4,000 lb + 2 x 1,000 lb payload works best when used on airfields.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It was designed to have outstanding high altitude performance and speed, being unparalleled for 10 years. Despite the RAF originally  expecting the Canberra to be obsolete within a few years of entering service, so much so that work to develop a replacement (eventually leading to the TSR-2) was started before it had even entered service, it would go on to be one of the RAF's longest serving aircraft. The Canberra remined in front line service with the RAF until its retirement in 2006, some 55 years after it first entered service (although it spent a lot of that time in the photo-reconnaissance role, as opposed to its original purpose as a bomber). The Canberra was replaced in the strategic bomber role by the Valiant (and other V-bombers), and in the strike role by the Buccaneer (following the cancellation of the TSR-2 programme). It established a world altitude record of 21,430 m in 1957 and was the first jet-powered aircraft to make a non-stop transatlantic flight.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nWhilst the United States and the Soviet Union were, in many ways, running ahead of Britain during the early development of jet fighters, Britain would at least keep up if not forge ahead with its very first jet bomber – the legendary English Electric Canberra.\n\nThe origins of the Canberra lay in 1944 when the Air Ministry called for a replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito in the light bomber role – a fast, agile tactical bomber was required by RAF Bomber Command to move into the jet age. English Electric set to work under Chief Engineer WEW Petter, who envisaged a bomber built around straight wings of a large area, and two of the new Rolls-Royce Avon jet engines. The prototype first flew in May 1949, with Typhoon-ace Roland Beamont at the controls. The Chief Test Pilot remarked that the aircraft was practically free of vices and possessed an agility that was reminiscent of a fighter rather than a bomber.\n\nAfter various modifications were made, including the addition of a glass nose for a bomb aimer, the first production variant – the B Mk.2 - entered service in 1951 with No.101 Squadron. The Canberra was able to reach speeds of some 560 mph and reach heights of 48,000 feet whilst maintaining the capacity to carry 6000 lbs of ordnance. A series of modified Canberra B Mk.2s set a succession of world altitude records, culminating in August 1957 with a staggering 70,310 feet. It was a Canberra that saw victory at the Last Great Air Race from London to Christchurch in 1953. With a range of approximately 2600 miles, the Canberra was considered a tactical rather than a strategic bomber.\n\nThe Canberra was popular with its aircrew due to its performance, popular with ground crews due to its relatively simple maintenance schedule and also popular with Command due to its relatively low cost. Over 400 Canberra B Mk.2's were built until uprated engines led to the development of its successor, the B Mk.6, which entered service in the summer of 1954. As squadrons received the newer model, the now older B Mk.2 saw service with the RAF in Germany, Cyprus and the Far East, although the variant did serve successfully in the Suez Crisis of 1956. A small number of export variants of the B Mk.2 also saw service with the United States as a template for building under license as the Martin B-57, Australia and Venezuela.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=canberra_bmk2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Canberra (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/648|[Devblog] Canberra Mk2]]\n* [[wikipedia:English_Electric_Canberra|[Wikipedia] English Electric Canberra]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer EEC}}\n{{Britain jet aircraft}}"}}
