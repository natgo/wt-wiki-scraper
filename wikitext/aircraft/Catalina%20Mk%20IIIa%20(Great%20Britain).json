If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).-->\n\nThe Catalina Mk IIIa is a slow, heavy aircraft with a fantastic bomb load for its BR. Its dual 12.7 mm machine guns on either side of the rear fuselage can tear apart early fighters which it will predominantly face. Though it does have a dead zone directly behind the tail, this can be fixed by applying gentle rudder movement from side to side so one of your 12.7 mm machine guns can open up. The single 7.62 mm Browning defending below the rear of the aircraft can inflict some damage if equipped with AP belts, but try to get the 12.7 mm on target as soon as possible. The four 1,000 lb bomb load is excellent at its BR, being able to destroy large targets such as destroyers, heavy tanks and bases. Torpedoes can also be equipped, but the Catalina is a big, slow target for a ships AA guns so it's preferable to drop bombs on them from above at a higher altitude. Wings can also be ripped off very easily above 315 km/h if sharp movements are made.\n\nThe gunners have fairly good protection with armour plating around their positions, and the Catalina can take an enormous amount of punishment - but she can't sustain flight on one engine. This means you should always be wary of engine damage and return to base if one of them is leaking oil or coolant, though thanks to the large wing area the Catalina can glide a surprisingly long way if both engines are knocked out of action. In RB, the Catalina is an easy target for enemy fighters with mouse aim so high altitude bombing is recommend, but in SB the Catalina excels at ground attack and is incredibly hard to take out when crewed by an experienced pilot. Avoid airfields and destroyers at all costs unless at high altitude however, the anti-aircraft can easily hit you with the slow cruising speed of only 250 km/h. Being very heavy, the Catalina can be hard to reduce altitude with without going too fast - so the landing gear can be extended and used as an airbrake! The speed at which it rips off is much higher than the speed that the Catalina can actually go.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

A development of Consolidated's P2Y flying boat, the aircraft adopted the same parasol wing but in a far more streamlined design with less struts and bracing wires and retractable stabilizing floats. The prototype XP3Y-1 first flew on March 28th 1935 before carrying out a highly successful series of service trials with the US Navy. Impressed by its long range, the US Navy requested that Consolidated Aircraft make further modifications to increase the aircraft's offensive capability. The original 825 hp engines were increased to 900 hp Pratt and Whitney R-1830-64 engines and the vertical fin was modified. The improved aircraft, now designated the X-PBY-1, broke records by carrying out the furthest nonstop distance flight of 3,443 miles. The PBY entered service with the US Navy in October 1936.\n\nBy the time Britain's Royal Air Force had shown a serious interest in the aircraft, it had gone further improvements, not least of which was the installation of two 1,000 hp Twin Wasp engines. The British Air Ministry purchased a single aircraft for evaluation purposes in 1939, and ordered 50 shortly afterwards under the designation of Catalina I – a name which would later be adopted by the US Navy also. British and Commonwealth Catalinas differed from their American counterparts mainly by the replacement of American weapons with British ones. The Catalina I entered service with Nos.209 and 240 Squadrons of RAF Coastal Command in 1941. A popular and capable aircraft, orders were also secured for Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. In the hands of Coastal Command crews, the Catalina proved to be an effective and much feared U-boat killer.\n\nThe Catalina Mk IVa was the British designation for the PBY-5 variant; powered by two 1,200 hp Twin Wasps, this aircraft was capable of reaching speeds of up to 179 mph at 7,000 feet and had a range of over 2,500 miles. Armed with defensive machine guns in four positions, the Catalina Mk IV's main offensive capability lay with its 4,000 lb of bombs or depth charges. One of the most famous and effective maritime patrol aircraft of the entire war, the true testament to the Catalina lies in the fact that many are still in service with civilian agencies across the globe to this day.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=pby-5a_raf Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Consolidated}}\n{{Britain bombers}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
