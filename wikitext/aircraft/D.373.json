In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} reserve French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 \"Vive la France\"]].\n\nThe D.373 is the third production aircraft of the D.37 series, which is available as a follow on aircraft for all pilots advancing in the French tech tree. The D.373 (along with its older siblings D.371 and D.371 D.S.9) is unique compared to other early aircraft in the game as it is a monoplane with a parasol wing, as opposed to other low-wing monoplanes and biplanes. Key features of this aeroplane include 4 x Darne 1933 Mle 33 7.5 mm machine guns and wheel brakes. On the other hand, the D.371 also features an open cockpit and no armour protection like many early aircraft. The key difference between the D.373 and the D.371 other than the type of machine guns utilised is that the D.373 is a version specially modified to fly for the French Navy and has an added tail-hook for snagging arrestor cables on aircraft carrier flight decks.\n\nThis aircraft is the second of the D.37 series featured in the game along with its older sibling the D.371. As a single-engine monoplane, it is agile and quick and while it can be a formidable turn-fighter, maintaining speed in this aircraft is crucial or else it becomes a slow easy target for other aircraft. The Mle 33 machine guns are not that powerful, however having four of them will enable the pilot to sling quite a bit of lead at the target aircraft.\n\nDue to the D.373 being a lower rank I aircraft, it is not uncommon for it to be pitted against higher rank I aircraft and even some lower rank II planes too. While slower than many of the higher aircraft it may face, not all is lost. The D.373 will have a manoeuvrability advantage and if the pilot can pull the higher rank enemy into a turn-fight, the D.373 may be able to turn the tables and score a win. Don't count the D.373 out of the fight until the pilot bails out of the plane, if still flying, it can fight!\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nEarly aircraft did not feature much in the way of armoured protection as many of the aircraft at this point were transitioning from the wood frame and cloth skin to the wood frame and metal skinned aircraft. Due to the balancing of the aircraft, much of the critical equipment was positioned towards the front of the aircraft, where the engine, fuel tanks, oil pumps, control linkages and the pilot were clustered around each other. With this tight grouping and no armour protection, when fired upon, chances were high to hit a critical component in the aircraft.\n\nThe key to survival is to keep moving (avoid flying in straight lines and always be looking around) along with being aware of your surroundings, if you start hearing bullets or see tracer fire whizzing by, it may be too late and the pilot will need to take evasive action to avoid being shot down.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Mle 33 (7.5 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 4 x 7.5 mm Mle 33 machine guns, wing-mounted (300 rpg = 1,200 total)\n\nEach of the four machine guns is bundled into groups of two and mounted to the underside of the upper wing. Each machine gun is outfitted with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty. Due to the mounting locations on the wings (outside of the propeller arc) and the calibre of the machine guns, convergence in this aircraft is important. Most of the fighting with this aircraft will be in close quarters to exploit the power of the machine guns up close. Convergence set between 150 and 300 m (wherever you are most comfortable) will work best to put the most bullets into the enemy aircraft as possible and hit a critical component. Many pilots in World War I and II would set their weapon's convergence to 200 to 250 m and would wait until being in that range before firing to ensure the best chances for shooting down the enemy. Shots from too far away could \"spook\" the enemy into evasive manoeuvres or just waste ammunition in a \"spray and pray\" manoeuvre. Practice and skill will allow the pilot to close within 250 m of the enemy and take them out with controlled bursts and then move onto the next victim.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in an aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nMaintaining speed with this aircraft is a must as a slow D.373 is an easy target. Initial spawning into a map should lead a D.373 pilot to climb and gain altitude. This will give you an advantage over most other pilots upon reaching the combat area as you can select which enemy plane to dive on and attack. With a diving attack, you will gain speed which will allow you to quickly gain on the enemy aircraft fire off a burst of rounds and then climb back up for altitude. If you decide to tail an enemy plane after a dive, you will risk bleeding off your energy. When attacking an enemy plane, attempt to attack when you see the greatest surface area of the fuselage and wings. If tailing a fighter, wait for them to turn or pull-up to expose the most surface area. When turn fighting or looping, utilise your rudder to sharpen your turning ability.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The cockpit did not have an enclosed canopy; just a windshield forward of the pilot.\n\nThe D.373 was the third variation version of this aircraft line which is a navalised version of the D.371, also powered by a Gnome Rhône 14Kfs radial engine. The only real change between this aircraft and a D.371 is the addition of a tail-hook for carrier landings. Four Mle 33 7.5 mm machine guns were installed, two in each wing and positioned outside of the propeller arch which eliminated the need to synchronize the guns to the propeller spin.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=d_373 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|oAQlqwMMX2s|'''The Dewoitine D.371 & D.373''' - ''SirKittalot''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[D.371]] - Initial production variant of the fighter\n* [[D.371 H.S.9]] - D.371 variant with 20 mm cannon armament\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/385694-dewoitine-d-37x/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dewoitine}}\n{{France fighters}}"}}
