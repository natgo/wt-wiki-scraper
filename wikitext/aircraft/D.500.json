Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 \"Vive la France\"]].\n\nThe D.500 is an all-metal mono-wing French aircraft with an open cockpit and fixed landing gear being built all through the mid-1930s. This fighter was France’s primary fighter aircraft until the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighter replaced it in 1939. When playing Simulator Battles (or Arcade and Realistic Battles in cockpit view), this aircraft offers excellent visibility only really limiting visibility where the wings protrude out of the fuselage. This aircraft boasts 1,200 rounds of ammunition split between four machine guns which can do severe damage especially when gun convergence is between 150 and 350 m.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.-->\nAs an early monoplane fighter, the D.500 handles quite well for a plane of its era. The aircraft's acceleration and climb rate are all quite satisfactory for a reserve fighter, though it should be noted that the sea-level top speed is quite low, at just over 300 km/h in level flight. The plane has a decent turn rate, but will not be able to out-turn manuveurable biplane fighters such as the [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]]. It should also be noted that the aircraft's engine doesn't have a WEP setting in Realistic Battles, and can overheat if left on 100% throttle for too long. The plane's control surfaces are all quite responsive and perform quite well at speeds between 250-350 km/h.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in an aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe D.500 is a good beginner aircraft for newer pilots. This airplane in the French tech tree is only one of two non-biplane aircraft offered as a reserve aircraft; the [[P-26 (Family)|P-26 Peashooter]] being the other. This aircraft is an excellent aircraft for in-close fighting. Bringing in the gun convergence between 150 and 350 m and then targeting an enemy fighter/bomber aircraft within that range or closer will allow for all four guns to do the most damage along with potentially setting alight the enemy vehicle. This aircraft can switch between attacking aircraft and ground vehicles with no problems as it is still quite manoeuvrable at lower speeds and altitudes. Long continued bursts from the guns can quickly lead to the machine guns jamming: instead, utilise short controlled bursts which should allow you to avoid that. In Arcade Battle, the relatively short ammunition reload rate (~10 seconds) will have you back in action fairly quickly. This aircraft is a very good plane in simulator battles because of its superior visibility as it has no canopy.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

No rear protection at all for the pilot. Open cockpit is also vulnerable to pilot sniping\n\n== History ==\n<!--Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/ History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable)-->\n\nIn 1930, the French Air Ministry issued a new specification, C1, for a new fighter to replace the obsolete NiD-62 fighters then in service with the French Air force. Several companies rushed to develop an aircraft for the specification, including the French manufacturer Dewoitine. They designed an all-metal interceptor with fixed landing gear, and submitted their proposal, named D.500, to the Air Ministry. The aircraft performed its first flight on June 18th of 1932, and in November of 1933, the Air Ministry ordered an initial batch of 60 fighters.\n\nThe first models of the D. 500 were inducted into the French Air Force at the beginning of 1935. At the time, the aircraft was one of the most advanced fighters available, featuring a variety of innovative features. The aircraft operated as the primary French fighter from 1935 to 1939, even though the design was rapidly becoming obsolete due the advent of new technologies. In 1939, the aircraft were replaced in front-line duty by the more capable [[M.S.406C1|M.S.406]], and remaining D.500s were relegated to training and regional defence squadrons.\n\nAt the start of the Second World War, the bulk of France's air force consisted of aircraft from the D. 500 family, including about 80 D. 500s. Due to its obsolescence, the aircraft did not see active service during the Battle of France, and the majority were broken up by the Germans after the French Armistice. The aircraft's technological advances were inherited by its direct successor, the [[D.520|D.520]]. In total, 102 D.500s airframes were manufactured, including a prototype and three aircraft sold to Venezuela. A total of 381 D.500 family aircraft were built, most of which had been retired by the early days of the Second World War.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=d_500 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/385910-dewoitine-d500/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dewoitine}}\n{{France fighters}}"}}
