In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 \"Vive la France\"]].\n\nThe D.501 is an all-metal mono-wing aircraft with an open cockpit and fixed landing gear. Built in the mid 1930s, it was one of the main French fighter aircraft until it was replaced by Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 aircraft in 1939. When playing SB (or AB and RB in cockpit view) this aircraft offers excellent visibility, only limited by the position of the wings. This aircraft has 600 rounds of ammunition between two machine guns and 60 rounds of 20 mm ammunition. This aircraft can really do some damage when gun convergence is set between 250 and 350 m.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Each of the machine guns are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that they will fire with each other until empty. On the other hand, the cannon only has 60 rounds of ammunition and if fired at the same time and at the same rate as the machine guns, it will run out of ammo first.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in an aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe D.501 is a French fighter which can be utilized for air-to-air combat or ground attack on light ground units (armoured vehicles and mobile AAA units). Good speed and manoeuvrability allows this aircraft to use its rudder and ailerons to roll, turn and manoeuvre out of tight spots. When going after ground units, this aircraft can make an attack and then loop up and back over down onto remaining targets with ease. The 20 mm cannon adds an extra punch which many early aircraft do not have and can be used to great effect on other aircraft, including larger bombers. However, thanks to its bad survivability, take care when engaging bombers, and remember: don't get shot at.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The specification mostly intended to replace France's inventory of old WW1 and 1920 era aircraft with more modern designs. Famous aircraft designer Émile Dewoitine, submitted his D.500 design and almost immediately caught the attention of the Air Ministry's officials. Shortly after the D.500 had its maiden flight in 1932, an order for 60 aircraft was placed in 1933, 10 of which were for the D.501. In essence, the D.501 was just a subvariant of the D.500. The two major differences lie in the powerplant and armament. Namely, the D.500 used a Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs engine, whilst the D.501 was equipped with a 12Xcrs engine, that allowed for the installation of a 20mm cannon through the propellor hub. This change also caused the removal of the two nose-mounted machine guns from the original layout, found on the D.500. Whilst a single 20mm cannon, paired with a couple machine guns may seem like a laughable setup today, the sheer presence of an autocannon on an aircraft back then was deemed almost as a luxury.\n\nBy the outbreak of WW2, aircraft of the D.500 series were more than outdated by machines of other nations, including some of the late 1930s French aircraft, such as the MS.406. The machines rarely saw front line use, instead being relegated to reserve units of the French Air Force and to trainer roles. However, a small number of aircraft did see limited action during the Spanish Civil War, likely being the only recorded combat use of the aircraft. Just under 400 aircraft of the D.500 series were manufactured, around 160 of which were D.501s.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=d_501 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|AhexrLFQJY4|'''Community Choice D.501.
