It has no suspended armament capability and thus is limited to aerial combat. In this respect, there are a few things to consider, first and foremost that this is a fighter that does not do great away from a squad. It has mediocre flight characteristics as far as speed, climb and turn are concerned. It is however quite well armoured to compensate for such, meaning that it will stay airworthy where other aircraft would crash, and instead stands a fighter which is effective in engagements where it has support to rely on. Without such support, it is a very situational plane which can engage certain enemies depending on advantage in altitude, speed, or sometimes even a turning radius. It has a respectable armament of one powerful Hispano 20 mm cannon with a very limited ammunition load (60 rounds), and four 7.5 mm machine guns with a good deal of ammunition which makes it competitive in realistic battles. Its strong airframe is able to withstand significant wind resistance making it potent in a longer dive. Despite its limited attributes, it handles fairly comfortably and thus can be a real asset to a pilot which employs situational awareness combined with an in-depth understanding of the enemy aircraft he will choose to either engage or avoid. It has a potent incendiary tracer round for its machine guns and the Hispano makes it pack a fairly significant punch despite its limited cannon ammunition. The D.520 is best considered a heavier single-seat fighter aircraft which can out-endure other enemy squads due to its armour, but not outturn, outrun, outgun many other types of aircraft at its own rank.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The MAC 1934 machine guns had a high rate of fire of 1,200 rounds per minute (rpm), while the effective HS.404 fired at 600 rpm and was accurate up to 500 m (1,600 ft); the ammunition capacity meant that the machine guns could be fired for a total of 30 seconds, while the cannon had 10 seconds worth of ammunition. In combat the MS.406 had only two 7.5 mm and was, therefore, at a disadvantage when the HS.404 had used up its ammunition, while a D.520 could continue to fight effectively because it had four fast-firing machine guns (over 80 rounds/sec), with 20+ seconds of ammunition still available. The D.520 had provisions for two BE33 \"illuminating bombs\", useful for nocturnal interception missions, but these were seldom used because French fighters rarely flew night-time missions.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Dewoitine D.520 was a French single-seat, all-metal, monoplane fighter which first entered service in 1940. In 1936 the French Armée de l'Air stated a requirement for a cannon armed fighter capable of speeds of 500 km/h. Emile Dewoitine began work on a design to meet this criteria and a prototype D.520-01 conducted its first test flight on October 2nd 1938. After some initial teething problems, the first production run was started in October 1939. In April 1940 the first D.520s were declared operational in Groupe de Chasse 1/3, a Groupe which already included a good number of combat experienced pilots.\n\nThe Dewoitine D.520 was powered by a liquid-cooled Hispano-Suiza HS12Y-45 engine, rated at 920 hp. Its armament comprised of one Hispano-Suiza HS404 20 mm cannon with 60 rounds and four belt-fed MAC 1934 M39 7.5mm machine guns in the wings with 675 rounds each.\n\nThe outbreak of war had made any further refinement of the aircraft impossible, and as a result production commenced with minimal delays, leaving no time for proposed improvements to be implemented. Instead, upgrades would be made during production, as time allowed. The production model had a redesigned carburettor air intake and a modified cooling system for the engine. Later D.520s featured jet exhaust pipes. The production model was sometimes referred to as the D.520S (\"serial\") or the D.520C1 (\"chausser 1\" - single-seat fighter).\n\nThe Dewoitine D.520 flew its first operational sorties in May 1940 and the majority of its victories (18 confirmed kills) were achieved by one of the leading French aces, Adjudant-Chief (then Sous-Lieutenant) Pierre Le Gloan from GC III/6. Production of the D.520 was halted when France surrendered in the summer of 1940 and then restarted under German occupation in April of 1941.\n\nFrom September 1942, the D.520 was the main fighter of Vichy France; the puppet French government who now collaborated with Nazi Germany. From April 1941 onward D.520s took part in clashes with British forces in Lebanon and Syria. In November of 1942, some D.520s joined la France Libre and fought for the Allies in North Africa. The D.520 also served with the Luftwaffe, and the Germans supplied the fighters to their allies in Italy, Bulgaria, and Romania.\n\nThe Dewoitine D.520 is considered by many to be the best French fighter of World War II. Its initial competition included the Spitfire and the Messerschmitt 109, although its handling characteristics and performance were inferior to both. One senior British test pilot described it as underpowered, 'a nasty little brute' to fly and markedly inferior to both the Spitfire and Hurricane.\n\nD.520 fighters were mass manufactured intermittently until June 1944 and in all 610 were produced. The last D.520s, used as trainers, were retired by the Armée de l'Air in September 1953.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=d_520 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|xfhULunUBns|'''Sub's Choice Ep 17: D.520''' - ''Jengar''|EzuojV4HqHg|'''Pages of History: D.520'''  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/876--en|[Special] First Flight of Dewoitine D.520]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dewoitine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
