In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in the game during the Open Beta session as a reward vehicle for the [[wt:en/news/172--en|June 2013 \"Vive la Liberté!\"]] video contest and again for the [[wt:en/news/876/current|2014 \"First Flight of Dewoitine D.520\"]] event. The D.521 was a modified variant of the French Dewoitine D.520 which featured a Rolls Royce Merlin III engine and slight armament changes. Only one model was ever produced.\n\nThe D.521 is essentially a slightly improved version of the D.520. It has a somewhat improved engine (Rolls-Royce Merlin III) which constitutes the one major change. It does however have a slightly worse turn and climb rate which may be due to the added weight of said engine. At either rate, tactically, it is advised that you have good knowledge of the various aircraft's you will face as it does not excel at any one thing. By applying situational awareness and a degree of caution to your approach, you may find yourself to be quite successful with this machine, but regardless of if you approach this in Arcade or Realistic battles, you need to have a good idea about the aircraft you are likely to face in the battle rating of this aircraft.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Designed by the SNCAM (Société Nationale des constructions aéronautiques du Midi) company. The developmental prototype of the Dewoitine D.520-01 fighter took its maiden flight on 2 October 1938. Series production began at the SNCAM (later SNCASE) plant in Toulouse.\n\nWhile perfecting the series-produced Dewoitine D.520 fighters, designers also worked to create new models of the same plane. In November 1939, work began on creating the Dewoitine D.521 model, equipped with the British liquid-cooled V12 Rolls-Royce Merlin Mk.III engine with a rated output of 1,030 hp. It was suggested that a fighter fitted with this engine could reach a maximum horizontal speed of 570 km/h.\n\nSince an engine-mounted cannon could not be installed on the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, two Hispano-Suiza H.S.404 cannons were mounted on the wings instead. This meant that all the Dewoitine D.521's weaponry was mounted on the wings, and consisted of two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 drum magazine cannons with 60 shells each and four 7.5 mm Chatellerault MAC 1934 machine guns with 675 rounds each.\n\nNote that precise information (primarily photographs) on the practical configuration of the Dewoitine D.521's Hispano-Suiza wing-mounted cannons is not available. For this reason, we can only make educated guesses about the fighter's armament structure.\n\nOne of the early series-produced Dewoitine D.520 fighters was selected to be adapted as the Dewoitine D.521-01 prototype. Its maiden flight took place on 9 February 1940. It had an improved climbing rate, but the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was significantly heavier than the Hispano-Suiza 12Y installed on the series-produced planes, and this caused problems with the plane's center of gravity. Testing continued until March 1940. On the whole, the new plane failed to exceed the performance of the series-produced Dewoitine D.520s, and the Dewoitine D.521 project was closed.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=d_521 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dewoitine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
