One is located beneath the pilot, and the other two are in the wings, one in each wing. The gunner is exposed (his head sticks out of the aircraft).\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n* When grinding the D3A1 it's preferred to focus on grinding for the performance as the bomb load is already unlocked.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe D3A1 is Japan's early dive bomber, a highly manoeuvrable aircraft that is able to outturn a lot of enemies and avoid bursts of fire. Having a small turn radius gives the D3A1 a chance to defend itself by getting on the tail of enemy, but if the enemy is smart enough and doesn't try to turn with the D3A1, they can run away from the D3A1 after it has lost a bit of speed in turning around to get on the tail. But the D3A1 can still get in a couple of hits.\n\nD3A1 is capable of carrying a modest bomb load which is similar to early versions of [[Ju 87 (Family)|Ju 87]]. But it's also similar in terms of firepower as well with 2 x 7.7 mm [[Type 97 navy (7.7 mm)|Type 97 navy]] machine guns which can be used to defend itself from enemies, but also strafe light targets like AA/howitzer postions and light armoured vehicles like trucks and SPAA. D3A1 also has a defensive [[Type 92 (7.7 mm)|Type 92]] machine gun mounted on the back, the gunner has an impressive area of cover which eliminates most dead zones that other dive bombers and some bombers have.\n\nMain use of the D3A1 is dive bombing, that is where its strength lies, knocking out ground targets in ground battles or the AI targets in air battles, being able to dive near ground using the air brakes for accurate drop of bombs. After dropping bombs the D3A1 can be used as a fighter, but keep in mind that it has a relatively unprotected pilot and gunner, which makes it easy for enemy fighters and vehicles on the ground with AA-mounted machine guns to knock these out. The plane does not react well to being hit as well but it can still function relatively well even when damaged and can still put up a fight. Aircraft and vehicles equipped with 12.7 mm and above will make a quick work of the D3A1 either by getting the pilots or vital parts of the plane but also to set it on fire. 7.92 mm and below can also pose a threat if there is more than 1 mainly.\n\n'''Enemies to be aware of:'''\n\n* [[P-40E-1]], [[P-400]], [[He 100 D-1]], [[Bf 109 E-1]], [[P-66]], [[H-81A-2]] - These enemy fighters possess sufficient firepower and speed over the D3A1 to easily outclimb, outrun, and outgun the D3A1. They will Boom-n-Zoom the D3A1 and run away fast to prepare for the next attack, giving the D3A1 no chance to defend itself with its offensive machine guns.\n\n* [[I-153 M-62]] - The I-153 can outturn the D3A1 with ease and therefore will have no problem tailing the bomber in evasive manoeuvres.\n\n;Tip for taking off in simulator battles:\n\nHands-off carrier take-off (Auto engine control, no secondary weapons):\n\n* Start engine\n* Flaps: raised\n* Elevator trim: 8% up\n* Aileron trim: 0%\n* Rudder trim: 21% right\n* WEP throttle\n* Hands off controls until your plane lifts off the carrier\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe single-engine carrier-based Aichi D3A dive bomber, a metal-construction monoplane, was created by order of Japan's Supreme Command of Naval Aviation to replace the obsolete D1A biplane. The shape of the wing and tail, as well as the presence of special dive brake flaps, came from the German aircraft company Heinkel, which was in active partnership with Aichi.\n\nA D3A prototype was ready in late 1937, and mass production of the D3A1 began in 1940. A Kinsey 43 engine producing 1,000 horsepower was used, and the aircraft's armament consisted of two synchronous 7.7 mm machine guns over the engine and one hand-operated machine gun with the radio operator at the rear of the cab. The wings had folding wingtips and duralumin sheeting, and the ailerons and flaps were covered with fabric.\n\nDuring the first half of the Second World War, the D3A, along with the B5N Kate, were the main strike force of the Japanese fleet. At the time the D3A1 could be considered one of the best dive-bombers in the world. No other dive bomber had characteristics that were even close, until the arrival of the American Dauntless and Helldiver.\n\nAll in all, 470 D3A1s were produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=d3a1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|AW9Gjrax8Zg|'''The Shooting Range #53''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 06:58 discusses the D3A.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/98014-aichi-d3a1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Aichi}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
