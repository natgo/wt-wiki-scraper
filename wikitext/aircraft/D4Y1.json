Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' Suisei (Comet), nicknamed Judy by the Americans, is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. It is a very strong ground attack aircraft, and thanks to its high speed and agility, it can make a great fighter. This is your typical Japanese dive bomber, which has excellent ground pounding capabilities, as well as fighter hunting abilities. All these gifts come with downsides, as the D4Y1 is unable to carry rockets or torpedoes, unlike the [[D4Y2]], and has poor defensive armament compared to the [[D4Y3 Ko|D4Y3]]. It has an Atsuta Atsuta 21 12-cylinder inline engine, which provides excellent power, but unfortunately has overheating issues.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n[[File:D4Y1wikihard1.png|thumb|The D4Y1 going into a dive to destroy a small boat]]\nThe D4Y1 is a highly agile and speedy aircraft, it can turn fight anything it wishes, even [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]]. It gets a bomber airspawn, which allows the D4Y1 to outclimb all the fighters, but '''be sure to select the right airspawn''', because it gets a carrier spawn by default on pacific maps. The only issue with the performance of this aircraft arises at high altitudes, where it is left without a supercharger.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,750 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Additionally, the fuel tanks are not self-sealing. There are 2 in each wing. The gunner is not covered, making him vulnerable to attacks from the rear.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nThe payload option should be a top priority, so getting to tier three modifications is of utmost importance. Rush the new belts and MGs, or the radiator or compressor if you choose to have better performance. Then get the bomb modification.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:D4Y1wikihard6.png|thumb|The D4Y1 in Fiji]]\nThe D4Y1 is an excellent example of a multirole aircraft, as it is an excellent ground attack aircraft, fighter, and bomber. Since you get a bomber airspawn, you can drop your bomb on a base and then start to engage the many fighters below you. You should have no problems engaging them, as long is you keep your speed up and your energy high. One key thing to note is that you don't need to use your defensive turret to shoo away enemy interceptors. You can easily out turn any interceptor at that BR. Besides the fighter role, ground attack is the D4Y1's natural method of play. The 500kg bomb will be excellent for destroying Pillboxes, and you can use your Rifle Caliber machine guns to destroy any soft target you please.Spec\n\n=== Specific enemies worth noting ===\n\n* [[CW-21]] - The CW-21 poses a significant threat to the D4Y1, as it can out-turn, out-climb, and outclass the D4Y1 in every conceivable way. Its armament will shred through the D4Y1, and your plane would be a sitting duck. Now, your gunner can be of some use. Since the CW-21 is a very fragile aircraft, your gunner can set it afire, thus giving you the upper hand. But never under any circumstance attempt to go near this plane, as your gunner is only a last resort.\n* [[He 100 D-1]] - Much like the CW-21, this aircraft will outclass you in every way. Your turret will once again come in handy, as it will surely damage its cooling system.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The D4Y1 was modeled after the German He 118 with the engine being modeled after the DB 601 which was used in the Bf 110. Due to the Japanese Navy requiring an extreme range for the aircraft, it was designed without any armour or self-sealing fuel tanks to lighten the plane so it would use less fuel. The lack of armour and protection decreased the weight, making them extremely quick and nimble but fragile if taking enemy fire. Combined with the unreliable engine, the D4Y1 would see many upgrades in the following models adjusting many of the flaws.\n\nIn 1943 with the introduction of the F6F Hellcat, the D4Y's became a sitting duck. Whereas with the F4F Wildcat, the D4Y's could just outrun them, the F6F would catch them with ease. During the \"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\" a single F6F pilot Alexander Vraciu would shoot down 6 D4Y's within minutes. 400 Japanese planes would be shot down that day, but a D4Y did land a direct hit on the battleship USS South Dakota.\n\nThe D4Y's would become one of the most iconic planes the Japanese Military would use during World War 2.\n\nOnly a single complete D4Y1 survives today, located at the \"Yasukuni Jinja Yūshūkan shrine\" in Tokyo it can be seen completely restored.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n{{Youtube-gallery|ViBJLbbWcI8|'''Update 1.75 - D4Y1''' - ''TheEuropeanCanadian''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[D4Y (Family)|D4Y family]]\n* [[D4Y2]] - An improved D4Y1 with a better engine and rocket payload\n* [[D4Y3 Ko]] - An improved D4Y2 with an even better engine and a better turret\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/392577-d4y1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yokosuka}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
