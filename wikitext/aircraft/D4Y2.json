In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese dive bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 \"New E.R.A.\"]].\n\nThe D4Y2 is a very strong ground attack aircraft, and thanks to its high speed and agility, it can make a great fighter. This is your typical Japanese dive bomber, which has excellent ground-pounding capabilities, as well as fighter-hunting abilities. Since the D4Y2 gets a bomber airspawn, it can outclimb any fighter you want. You can also outspeed and outmanoeuvre pretty much anything, even [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]]. However, the D4Y2 carries something special, something that the [[D4Y1]] and [[D4Y3 Ko]] cannot carry, '''fused rockets'''. What some might realize about Japanese planes is their inability to bomber hunt. Fused rockets fix this issue, by being a great pick to tackle slow, sturdy, and sluggish bombers. Even if you don't get the rockets exactly on point, the explosion near the bomber could be enough to rip a wing off or damage their controls.\n\nDespite all these advantages, the D4Y2 still has many flaws. It is very fragile, and shouldn't be exposed to .50 calibre Brownings, as they will almost always set you on fire. Even though it has high speed and agility, it bleeds energy so quickly that turnfighting for prolonged periods is not recommended. You also don't have the greatest turret, as the Type 92 is completely unreliable to down air targets, so it should be used to scare away fighters rather than destroy them. Always try outmanoeuvring fighters before you dive away from them.\n\n== General info ==\n[[File:D4Y2bombs.png|thumb|The D4Y2 in flight]]\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe D4Y2 behaves much like the D4Y1: fast, agile, and powerful. However, since you don't get a radial engine, your Atsuta engine will overheat very easily on WEP, even with both radiators fully open. WEP should be used when on the deck when ground pounding, or in dogfights. Using WEP while climbing should only be done on cooler maps. It gets a bomber airspawn, which allows the D4Y2 to outclimb all the fighters, but '''be sure to select the right airspawn''', because it gets a carrier spawn by default on pacific maps. The only issue with the performance of this aircraft arises at high altitudes, where it is left without a supercharger.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,250 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThe D4Y2, like its predecessor the [[D4Y1]], lacks any armour and self-sealing fuel tanks. The fuel tanks are located in the same location (2 in each wing). The gunner is still unprotected.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nThe payload option should be a top priority, so getting to tier three modifications is of utmost importance. Rush the new belts and MGs, or the radiator or compressor if you choose to have better performance. Then get the bomb modification. After that, research all engine modifications and then the survivability modifications. Save the turret upgrades for last.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n[[File:D4Y2rockets.png|thumb|The D4Y2's fused rocket payload]]\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:D4Y2inflight.png|thumb|The D4Y2 in flight]]\nThe D4Y2 is a pilot's play, meaning that you can choose whatever role you wish in a D4Y2, since it has bombs, rockets, and a bomber airspawn.\n\n'''Interceptor''': The D4Y2 can carry fused rockets, meaning they'll explode after a certain distance. Usually Japanese planes are horrible interceptors, they are slow, easily set on fire by turrets, and have poor armament. However, the D4Y2 can carry rockets, turning the tables in the D4Y2's favour. Set a fuse on your rockets to whatever you please, as long as it is between 400 and 800 meters. Use impact fuse however, when ground pounding. To intercept a bomber, don't rely on your machine guns. Don't tail the bomber either. Instead, dive on it, or engage in a head-on if they don't have forward guns. Fire your rockets when you are exactly the distance away from the bomber as your fuse distance is. Remember to lead, as the rockets tend to curve and don't travel as fast as the MGs.\n\n'''Fighter''': The D4Y2 is a great fighter, but has two flaws, armament and energy retention. Speed is your armour, as well as altitude, because you cannot retain any energy in a boom and zoom attack. It isn't a good idea to boom and zoom either, unless the enemy aircraft is a bomber, or a damaged fighter, or any other slow target. Your fights will mostly occur near the ground, where the D4Y2 has good acceleration. You can turn with anything you wish. However, there is one danger with fighting near the ground. If you lose all of your energy when turnfighting (it '''will''' happen sometimes), you become the perfect target for a boom and zoom attack. Since you can't dive away from boom and zoomers on the ground, the D4Y2 is a sitting duck. The turret won't do anything either, but trying to dodge the incoming threat is still a good option, as long as you keep your speed up.\n\n'''Attacker''': Since the D4Y2 can carry bombs and rockets, we must discuss the attacker role of this aircraft. On new maps like Honolulu, as well as old maps like Iwo Jima, rockets will be a good pick. Rockets easily destroy cargo ships, especially ones on the move. Take the bombs on maps with light pillboxes. Use your armament only for AAA, howitzers, artillery, and lightly armoured trucks. Once all ammunition is spent, or if enemy fighters are sighted, return to the base.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It sported a 1,400 hp \"Aichi AE1P Atsuta 32\" engine. The D4Y2 would see 7 variants, and was the most widely used version of the D4Y series.\n\nSome variants had very unique roles such as the D4Y2 KAI ''Suisei Model 22,'' designed to be launched from a battleship by the means of a catapult.\n\nWith a range of 1,400 miles the D4Y2 was perfect for the defence of the Japanese territories. Combined with its extreme accuracy in a dive, it saw great success. However, with Allied aircraft upgrading from the F4F Wildcat to the F6F Hellcat, it was no longer fast enough to escape and started seeing massive casualties in missions which just months before would have had little to no casualties. The increased death rates of the pilots and crew saw pilots becoming less and less experienced, increasing the death rates even further. Slowly the time of the D4Y's was coming to an end.\n\nNo D4Y2's survived the war, but their legacy lives on as a feared a ruthless dive bomber and night fighter. Their achievements include the attack on the USS Enterprise and attack on the USS Bunker Hill which was damaged beyond repair at sea and had to return to port in the United States to repair.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n{{Youtube-gallery|nPvtxhDMW-E|'''D4Y2 <nowiki>[Rocket Fun Derp Time]</nowiki>''' - ''Jengar''|dDuMg-QvRfM|'''D4Y2 - Meteor Shower''' - ''tx141TX''|5lO_4fvWHwg|'''Update 1.71 - D4Y2''' - ''TheEuropeanCanadian''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[D4Y1]], the first series of the D4Y\n* [[D4Y3 Ko|D4Y3]], a D4Y1 with a new turret and engine\n* [[D4Y (Family)|D4Y family]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role and era\n\n* [[SBD-3]] - Early war American dive bomber\n* [[SB2C-4]] - Late war American dive bomber\n* [[A-35B (France)|A-35B]] - French dive bomber with 6 x machine guns\n* [[B17A]]/[[B17B|B]] - Swedish light/dive bomber\n* [[Ju 87 (Family)|Ju 87 D]] - German ground attack dive bomber\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4968-development-d4y-suisei-light-em-up-en|[Devblog] D4Y Suisei - Light 'Em Up]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/378378-d4y2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Yokosuka_D4Y|[Wikipedia] Yokosuka D4Y]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yokosuka}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
