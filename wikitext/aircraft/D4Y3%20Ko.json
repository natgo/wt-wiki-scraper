In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese dive bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 \"New E.R.A.\"]].\n\nThe D4Y3 is an overall improvement to the D4Y series, it has improved defensive armaments, better bomb loads, and a new radial engine which keeps itself cool. All these advantages give it a 3.0 battle rating, which unfortunately outclasses its armament, rendering it less effective at the fighter role than the [[D4Y1]] and [[D4Y2]].\n[[File:D4Y3-Ko6.png|thumb|The D4Y3 in flight]]\nThe D4Y3 is still a capable fighter despite these disadvantages, due to its high speed and turn time. It will find Spitfires excellent targets, as you can out turn spitfires and your guns will sooner or later knock out the pilot or rip off a wing, and sometimes damage the tail control. The D4Y3 is also strong in the ground attack role. Its three 250 kg (500 lb) bombs will have no trouble destroying light pillboxes, medium tanks, and bases. The machine guns can also destroy anti-aircraft artillery and light trucks.\n\n[[File:D4Y3-Ko3.png|thumb|D4Y3 in a dive]]\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe D4Y3 has superior performance to the first two [[D4Y (Family)|D4Y]] aircraft, as it has a radial engine, which won't overheat in combat conditions. The radial engine also has a less pronounced radiator, resulting in less drag. The D4Y3 is a capable turner but bleeds energy easily. It is recommended to do hard turns in combat situations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,050 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThe D4Y3 ditches self-sealing fuel tanks and armour for speed and agility. As such, the D4Y3 should be treated like any other Japanese aircraft, with the utmost caution.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nThe bomb load-outs should be a priority for this aircraft, and the frontal machine guns should also be a module of importance. The compressor, Engine, and Injection will prove useful. After researching the engine mods, rush the Suitability modules. Only then should you tackle the turrets. The Wings Repair and Fuselage repair should come last.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe D4Y3 is an excellent example of a multirole aircraft, as it is an excellent ground attack aircraft, fighter, and bomber. Since you get a bomber air spawn, you can drop your bomb on a base and then start to engage the many fighters below you. You should have no problems engaging them, as long as you keep your speed up and your energy high. One key thing to note is that you don't need to use your defensive turret to shoo away enemy interceptors. You can easily out-turn any interceptor at that battle rating. Besides the fighter role, the ground attack is the D4Y3's natural method of play. The 500 kg bomb will be excellent for destroying Pillboxes, and you can use your rifle-calibre machine guns to destroy any soft target you please.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Open the oil radiator and radiator to 10% when levelling off, to avoid overheat after prolonged periods of time. Propeller pitch should be kept at 90-100%, and stage two of the supercharger should only be activated at 3,000 meters (10,000 feet).\n\n[[File:D4Y3-Ko7RADIAL.png|thumb|The D4Y3 as seen from the front. The radial engine produces less drag, thus making it the fastest variant]]\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The removal of the tail hook and the addition of the Mitsubishi Kinsei 62 radial engine added 150 horse power while reducing weight. The D4Y3 would see 3 variants, D4Y3 model 33, D4Y3 model 33A, and D4Y3 model 33 night-fighter.\n\nDifferences between the Model 33 and the Model 33a was the A variant had the Type 1, 7.92mm rear firing machine gun replaced with an upgraded Type 2, 13mm rear firing machine gun. With the night-fighter variant being equipped with an upwards firing 20mm cannon. Only 3 night-fighters were built as the D4Y2 night fighters were being used with success with fighters already available and assembly lines already making them.\n\nWith a range of 1,400 miles the D4Y3 was perfect for the defense of the Japanese territories. Combined with its extreme accuracy in a dive it saw great success especially in the battles at the end of the war. Notably, crippling the USS Kalinin Bay and the USS Suwannee both escort carriers. Eventually they would convert the D4Y3 into a D4Y4, which was exactly the same as the D4Y3 except it carried an un-removable 800kg bomb for kamikaze attacks. Some D4Y4's were equipped with rockets to increase the speed at which the aircrafts would strike their targets increasing the damage they caused.\n\nNo D4Y3's survived the war, but a D4Y1 was reconstructed with a Pratt and Whitney R-1830 radial engine to represent a D4Y3. This plane can be seen at the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=japan&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=bomber&vehicle=d4y3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|_FXOCmAXPKY|'''War Thunder - Update 1.71 - D4Y3''' - ''TheEuropeanCanadian''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;[[D4Y (Family)|Related development]]\n* [[D4Y1]], the first series of the D4Y\n* [[D4Y2]], a D4Y1 with the ability to carry rockets\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role and era\n* [[SBD-3]]\n* [[SB2C-4]]\n* [[A-35B (France)|A-35B]]\n* [[B17A]]/[[B17B|B]]\n* [[Ju 87 (Family)|Ju-87 D]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/476272-d4y3-ko-multitask-er/ War Thunder Forum - D4Y3 Ko - Multitasker]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/378379-d4y3/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yokosuka}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
