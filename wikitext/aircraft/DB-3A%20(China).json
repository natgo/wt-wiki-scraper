It is a brilliant base / airfield-bombing plane with a maximum bombload of 1x 1,000 kg + 2x 500 kg bombs, allowing it to easily finish a base or cripple airfield modules in one run. The bombs drop one by one, allowing flexible targeting. It has greatly improved handling and stability comparing with the previous SB 2M, making flying a lot easier. However, the DB-3 is quite slow, making it an easy target to pick on. It also has next to no defensive firepower: only 3x 7.62 mm MG in total, the one in the nose has great coverage, however, most opponents are not likely to take head-ons. The top turret cannot even aim horizontally nor directly at the tail, meaning that the seemingly suicidal tactic of tailing a bomber can actually destroy a DB-3. The belly gun has good negative angle but its horizontal guidance is too limited. Therefore you can only target opponents at your front, upper half and lower rear. \n\nWhen taking off, the DB-3 will shift to the right, so it is best to set separate key-bind for left and right brakes to counter the torque. Given your weak guns, you can only survive if the room is rather empty or if the opponent also has weak firepower. If you are bombing a base, fly at treetop level to force any attacker to engage you from above so you can fight back. Bombing airfield is more dangerous, as you are not only exposed to anti-aircraft artillery fire but also attackers hiding in your gunner's dead zones. Climb to at least 2,000 m before approaching the airfield, then target the modules of fuel sector (surrounded by 4 towers), residential area (a bunch of tents) and hangar (6 giant houses). Bombing the airstrip is the easiest but it seems to give fewer rewards. If you see an attacker trying to shoot at you, you will have to nudge the plane so that the target is within your gunner's guidance which is very awful. The bullets will not do lots of damage as the target might constantly get into your dead zones. Most of the times against manoeuvring or heavily armed/armoured attackers, you will not survive long.\n\nLanding is easy and similar to the style of the SB 2M. Line up with the airstrip when it occupies around 1/3 of your windscreen and descent to treetop level. Cut throttle to around 0-40% to drop speed to 200 km/h, and deploy landing flaps and gears. Control the throttle so that the touchdown speed is around 140 km/h. Like the SB 2M, if you don't slow down enough the DB-3 will bounce off again and again which might lead to a crash. Once you landed, you can keep breaking as the nose will not dip down and cause a propeller strike. \n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Gunners are unprotected, and the 7.62 mm MGs lack damage\n* Quite slow and large, making it an easy target\n* Below average climb rate\n* Only has landing flaps\n* Negative deflection of the elevator will not pitch the plane down at 390+ km/h\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
