If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe DB-7 is a very fast aircraft for its rank, it can outrun most aircraft it faces in level flight. The DB-7 has four 7.5 mm light machine guns in the nose that are fixed and controlled by the pilot. Two additional guns are located in turrets facing the rear, one above and one below the fuselage. The upper turret has better coverage than the lower. Although the defensive armament may seem underwhelming, they are more than capable of dealing with planes of a lower BR. They can still be made to work against higher level planes if AP-T or AP belts are used. As always, one should aim for the pursuer's engine.\n\nThe recommended belt for the offensive weaponry is the Tracers belt (IT). For the defensive weaponry, the AP-T belt (IT/AP) is the best choice\n\nThe good level speed allows for hit and run tactics, however, some dedicated fighter pilots may choose to hunt you down regardless. In such cases try to run for allied fighters and drag the enemy behind. Alternatively, the superior climb rate in comparison to other bombers allows climbing above one's allies which subsequently act as meat shield i.e. other bombers are easier targets. Although this can turn into a false sense of security. Stay vigilant.\n\nIt is best to use the plane as a fast attacker. Keep your altitude and proceed to bomb points. Once your payload is delivered, you can engage enemy fighters which should still be climbing to reach your altitude while being careful not to become outnumbered or dive towards friendly forces in order to gain cover. Few are the planes which will be able to keep up with you if you choose the latter. If you are on a map with lots of vital soft targets, you can always engage those. One has to keep in mind that doing so will leave him exposed to enemy interceptors. If you decide to engage enemy fighters, you will find that the DB-7 is quite manoeuvrable for its size. Always keep an eye on your speed and avoid depleting too much of it in case you need to flee from the battle. The DB-7 can soak up a lot on LMG fire and return to base. The radial engines can also take a lot of punishment before going out. If the rest of its fuselage is not damaged, the aircraft can easily fly on one engine. HMGs and canons will quickly render the plane uncontrollable.\n\nWhile a lot of the above is true, it is much more important to stick with friendly forces since one can easily become outnumbered if on his own near the enemy's spawn point.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The French air force was the first air force to order the DB-7 (designated Boston at the time): as a result, the French DB-7s were the first to see service, fighting German units during the Battle of France. The DB-7 would later serve in the air forces of multiple air forces as an attacker, bomber and night fighter.\n\nThe original design of the DB-7 (Douglas Bomber 7) featured a pair of 450 hp engines, but after the Spanish Civil war proved that such an aircraft would be highly underpowered, the design was cancelled. However, in 1938, the Douglas Aircraft Company recommenced the development of the aircraft, now powered by a pair of 1100 hp Pratt & Whitney twin wasp engines; this aircraft was faster and carried a larger 2000 lb (900 kg) bomb load. The French immediately took interest to the aircraft and observed the development and testing process; even after a testing crash that killed a French observer, the French buying commission was sufficiently impressed to order 100 aircraft for use with the French Air Force.\n\nThe 100 DB-7 Bostons ordered by the French Air Force were delivered beginning from October 1939. The French were responsible for delivering the aircraft to France; as a result, the aircraft were shipped to Casablanca, where they were re-assembled and handed over to French units. By the start of the Battle of France, France possessed 70 of the 100 ordered aircraft, enough to equip three squadrons.\n\nFollowing the beginning of the Battle of France, the DB-7 squadrons were relocated to France, where they were used against German units, flying ~70 sorties against German ground forces and losing eight aircraft. With the fall of France looming ahead, the aircraft were transferred back to North Africa to avoid capture by German Forces. For a short time, the aircraft were under the control of Vichy France and flew sorties against Allied forces; after the French forces in Africa rejoined the Allies, the aircraft were relegated to second-line duties, being replaced by B-26 Marauders in the frontline attack role. Several aircraft would be relocated to France in the waning days of the war to fight against the Germans, but most of the French DB-7s would see no further combat service.\n\n''Note: while this aircraft is in the Great Britain aircraft tree, it is actually a French DB-7 with French markings.''\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Douglas DB-7 (DB-7B3) was a twin-engine light bomber/ground-attack aircraft of all metal construction. Jack Northrop started to develop this aircraft as early as 1936, on his own personal initiative. When, in 1937, the United States Army Air Corps command formulated its requirements for a next-generation ground-attack aircraft/bomber, the draft design of the Model 7A multi-purpose aircraft (which would combine the functions of a light bomber, a ground-attack aircraft, and a reconnaissance aircraft) was already complete.\n\nIn the meantime, the small Northrop Aviation Corporation was taken over by the Douglas Aircraft Company. Since the USAAC had not made their final choice about their main bomber, the Douglas Aircraft Company continued working on the aircraft, despite having no guarantee of its profitability. The first Model 7B prototype conducted its first test flight on October 26th 1938.\n\nThe French Purchasing Commission took an interest in the new aircraft and placed an order for a total of 100 aircraft in February 1939. The Model 7B prototype aircraft was altered at the customer's request: the modified aircraft, designated the DB-7 (Douglas Bomber 7), made its first flight on August 17th 1939. The first production bomber was delivered to the French in October 1939.\n\nThe production DB-7 was equipped with 1,000 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1830-SC3-G radial air-cooled engines with Hamilton Standard Hydromatic 23E50 three-bladed variable-pitch metal propellers.\n\nThe aircraft's defensive armament consisted of six 7.5 mm Chatellerault MAC 1934 machine guns of French manufacture. Four of these belt-fed machine guns, with 500 rounds each, were located in the nose section on each side of the navigator's glazed cockpit. One machine gun was mounted in the radio operator/gunner's cockpit in the rear upper gun position, and another one in the lower hatch. Both machine guns had 500 rounds each (5 pan magazines with 100 rounds). The DB-7 had an enlarged bomb bay, with its payload increased to an 800 kg capacity.\n\nThe American aircraft were designated DB-7B3 (B3 meaning \"three-seat bomber\") by the French Air Force. In the summer of 1940, DB-7s participated in combat operations in Southern France, where they suffered serious losses assaulting German tank columns without fighter cover. After the French surrender, these aircraft were used in the service of the Vichy French government who collaborated with Nazi Germany. In November 1942 the same aircraft were used to strike the British-American landing forces in Algeria during Operation Torch.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n{{Youtube-gallery|cxkPq8ICn3Y|'''The Shooting Range #25''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 00:42 discusses the DB-7.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* Douglas [[A-26 (Family)|A-26]] Invader\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Bristol [[Beaufighter (Family)|Beaufighter]]\n* Messerschmitt [[Bf 110 (Family)|Bf 110]]\n* Northrop [[P-61C-1|P-61]] Black Widow\n* Petlyakov [[Pe-2 (Family)|Pe-2]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/195735-douglas-db-7/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Douglas}}\n{{Britain bombers}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
