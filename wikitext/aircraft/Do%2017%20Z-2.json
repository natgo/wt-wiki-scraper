In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.53 \"Firestorm\"]]. The Do 17 Z-2 can carry more bombs than its predecessor, the [[Do 17 E-1]], and has more defensive armament. However, it retains the offensive 7.92 mm machine gun protruding from the cockpit found on the E-1.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis bomber, while not having enough payload for a base and being helpless against most fighters, makes an excellent ground attacker. Take out the convoys consisting of light tanks and unarmoured vehicles, gaining a ticket advantage for your team. It is recommended to stay at altitude until you are over the convoy you want to take out, then dive down, drop your bombs, and return to your airfield with the speed gained in the dive. After landing and rearming, try to sneak your way past the remaining fighters of the enemy team and destroy the ground targets left with your bombs and offensive armament.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This year, Donnell company came up with an initial design plan to compete for a six seat high-speed postal aircraft project, but the cabin was relatively narrow, the personnel were uncomfortable to ride, and the operation cost was high, so it was rejected, but it attracted the interest of the flight captain of Lufthansa Airlines at that time, and gave the evaluation of \"being as flexible as a fighter\" after the test flight. At that time, Germany did not dare to openly develop military bombers, so in March 1933, the newly established German Ministry of aviation issued the development plans of \"double vertical tail high-speed aircraft\" and \"cargo aircraft equipped with special equipment\", which were actually high-speed bombers.''\n\n''Z-type is the most productive and used modification, mainly bomber. Based on the combat experience during the Spanish Civil War, the front fuselage is redesigned, and the cockpit is larger. The Z-type originally planned to install the db600 engine, but because the output could not keep up, it was finally replaced by the bramo323 series Star air-cooled engine. The Z-type has several sub models, among which the z-0 is used for testing the engine, and the bramo323a-1 engine used by the Z-1 is proved to be insufficient in power, and the performance can not meet the requirements, especially the speed index is seriously reduced, so soon after, it was replaced with a 1000 HP bramo323p-1 engine to become the Z-2 type. Z-2 has been specially adjusted for the performance requirements of DO17. The increase in engine power increases the bomb load from 500 kg to 1000 kg, but the operational radius of a full bomb is only 330 km.''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=do_17z_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/266234-dornier-do-17-z-2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dornier}}\n{{Germany bombers}}"}}
