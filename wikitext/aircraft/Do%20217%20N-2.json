If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Do 217 N-2 plays similar to most other heavy fighters, in that it is reliant on delivering a quick knock out punch to an enemy to be effective. However, the aircraft has two unusual traits, which make for different play styles than other heavy fighters. The first is the lack of any form of turret weaponry. This makes the N-2 a unique member in the German heavy fighter line, as virtually all other heavy fighters either have a tail gunner or are agile enough to not need one. The second feature is the inclusion of a set of vertical firing cannons, known as Schräge Musik. This weapon package brings a unique benefit to the table. As most bombers lack the ability to fire their turrets directly under themselves, you can fire away with near-complete immunity to retaliation from enemy gunners.\n\nHowever, the N-2 is undeniably slow and has crushingly poor manoeuvring. This makes the lack of any form of turret defence all the more noticeable. Caution must be taken to avoid more nimble enemies when possible, as you will be greatly outclassed otherwise.\n\nWhile the aircraft as a whole seems heavily dependent on lumbering up to a high altitude, and then slowly hunting down bombers, there does exist a fun, if unconventional, alternative. The alternative approach is to go about strafing ground targets, while flying upside down. The main reason for upside down strafing is the Schräge Musik. By flying inverted, you can strafe a large number of ground units in a single pass, while remaining fairly high above the trees. This combines well with the fact that the vertical and forward cannons use the same ammo belts. This tactic can even be put to use around airfields, putting a quick end to anyone on the ground. The only thing to remember when doing this is to always keep a close eye on your altitude. Flying upside down will cause you to fall fairly quickly, so do remember to roll back to right side up in time to avoid crashing. Results are not guaranteed.\n\n* In simulator, the Schräge Musik provides a brand new way for bomber hunting. This weapon system is easy to learn but hard to master, and should only be used if the bomber is flying high, preferably above 800 m. if it is low, you are more likely to crash if you cannot control the aircraft well enough, or you can just use the forward-firing cannons. As you slide underneath a bomber, go into the Schräge Musik mode, and carefully align the reticle to the target. There is no set distance of how far below the target you should be, so the reticle will not always point towards where the shells will actually end up, so do fire some short bursts first to see if you are leading too much or not enough. Adjust the lead by controlling the pitch of the plane. Now as you watch the reticle move, you must also constantly scan the altimeter. This is because that in the Schräge Musik mode, you are just staring at the blank sky above so you are likely to lose sense of direction and not know whether you are diving or climbing. If the number jumps down rapidly, pull stick up immediately. To move the reticle sideways involve a combination of rudder and aileron input, which takes some practice. Each Schräge Musik cannon holds 200 rounds which leaves room for trial and error as they are indeed hard to aim. With precise aiming they are super efficient at destroying wings, fuselage and engines. \n\n===Radars===\n{{main|FuG 220}}\n\nThe Do 217 N-2 is equipped with a [[FuG 220]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft; a control box which is part of the radar damage model is located behind the pilot.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[FuG 220]] - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Guaranteed<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, detection of a target is practically guaranteed}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n|-\n| 5,000 m || 5,000 m || ±35° || -55°/+20°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This makes it excellent at head-on attacks against any aircraft, especially bombers and attackers\n* Rigid construction that can take a lot of punishment from MG fire. It also barely catches fire\n* Has access to a target detection radar which most planes don't have. Rather useful in clouds or with bad weather / low visibility\n* Decent dive acceleration allowing it to easily dive at more than 500 km/h, outrunning slower opponents like the I-16 and F4F\n* Improved ballistic performance of the 20 mm MG 151 over the FF/M allows for firing both the machine guns and cannons at the same time and hit the target accurately\n* The 20 mm AP shells, its huge ammo capacity and the 8 x 50 kg bombs give it ground pounding ability to some extent\n* Its appearance and name are very identical to its bomber variants. The player can sometimes utilise this and lure the unprepared enemy into a surprising head-on\n* Schräge Musik can be a devastating surprise, for example upside down strafing. While unconventional, it can be of great fun and effect\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Extremely poor manoeuvrability. Turn time is more than 27 second even when upgraded, meaning it might get out-turned by attackers like the IL-2, A-20G or even bombers like the B-25\n* Control surfaces tend to lock up at more than 500 km/h. Due to this, when diving it might not be able to pull up in time, or cannot pull the lead properly\n* No defensive firepower makes it totally defenseless against any chasers\n* Poor climb rate and energy retention makes it hard to intercept high-flying bombers\n* Poor roll rate makes it hard to respond to offensive / defensive manoeuvres (e.g. scissors). The I-16 now becomes a deadly opponent due to its superior roll rate\n* The fixed angle of the Schräge Musik makes it very hard to use, thus severely limiting its value in most scenarios\n* Its poor flight performance makes it thoroughly difficult to effectively combat other fighters\n* Is a big target which is easy to get hit\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Originally, planes of this variant were not equipped with defensive turrets, their bomb door was sealed shut, and no bomb release system was installed.\n\nA more advanced FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1 radar was mounted on the aircraft, different from the FuG 202 in its smaller weight, its modified antennas which provided lower aerodynamic resistance, and its enhanced accuracy. The effective detection range of the new radar was 100 to 2,000 m.\n\nThe above-mentioned measures helped significantly reduce the aircraft's takeoff weight, even though its armour had been reinforced (with an additional armour plate under the pilot's seat). The Do 217 N-2's speed and ceiling were higher than those of the N-1 variant.\n\nAs on the Do 217 N-1, a Schräge Musik mount could be installed on the aircraft.\n\nDuring full-scale production, some aircraft received an even more advanced FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 radar. This radar was able to operate when the British used passive radar interference, that is, fragments of metal foil scattered in the air by British bombers to blind German radars.\n\nSome Do 217 N-2s had a FuG 227 Flensburg radio direction finder tuned to the operating frequency of the British Monica radar which was installed in the tail section of RAF bombers to warn when German night fighters appeared. The use of the FuG 227 enabled German night fighters to reliably detect Allied bombers within a distance of up to 100 km and then pursue them.\n\nIn addition, one more radio direction finder, the FuG 350 Naxos Z, could be mounted on the Do 217N to detect British bomber units. It allowed the detection, within a distance of up to 50 km, of signals from the British H2S blind bombing radar system, which was installed on pathfinder aircraft flying in front of the bomber units.\n\nThe Do 217 N-2's production was discontinued in December 1943. A combined total of 364 Do 217s night fighters were built, including 130 Do 217Js and 234 Do 217Ns.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=do_217n_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|MNacjyimuCQ|'''The Shooting Range #95''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 12:02 discusses the Do 217 N-2.|LguBHOwyjyo|''(Arcade): {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''tx141TX''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Do 217 (Family)]]\n\n;Other aircraft equipped with Schräge Musik\n* [[Ki-45 tei]]{{-}}[[Ki-45 hei/tei (China)]]\n* [[Bf 110 G-4]]{{-}}[[Bf 110 G-4 (Italy)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/436317-do217n-12/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dornier}}\n{{Germany twin-engine fighters}}"}}
