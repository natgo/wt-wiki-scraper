In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]]. It was first conceived as a fighter for NATO's NMBR-1 fighter competition, where it lost against the Italian [[G.91 pre-serie]]. The French Navy, requiring a carrier-borne attacker, adopted the design, which was christened as the Etendard IVM. This is reflected in the Etendard's capability to dogfight other jet fighters while designated as a Strike Aircraft.\n\nThe many lessons learnt using the Etendard will be crucial for future French jets, which includes the [[Mirage F1C]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe Etendard has good acceleration up to 1050 km/h, after which the aircraft tends to have a very difficult time accelerating. Manoeuvrability is acceptable when above 800 km/h - not great, but not bad. However, dipping below 800 km/h causes the aircraft to lose much of its turning ability, which requires the pilot to pop out flaps to remain manoeuvrable. Energy retention is quite poor at all speeds, but once the aircraft is able to get back into a straight line, said energy will be regained quite quickly. The aircraft has a good rate of climb compared to its counterparts.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nAlthough it does not have an afterburner, the Etendard has a very competitive TWR and acceleration, thanks to its light weight and powerful engine. It also has a good climb rate, decent turn rate, and a fairly standard set of armaments. However, like many French jets at its rank, it tends to have poor energy retention, and any manoeuvring tends drastically reduce acceleration. This means that a turnfighting play-style is often difficult, and defensive flying is hard to do successfully- the player should avoid gaining a tail if at all possible.\n\nAs such, the aircraft's good climbing ability and acceleration make it better suited for a more passive boom and zoom play style, where it is unlikely that an enemy will be able to chase it down. Such a playstyle will require teamwork. The Etendard is by no means a solo carry, and diving in and out of furballs to support teammates is often necessary. In this play style, the player will be easily able to keep a speed above 800 km/h (below which the aircraft's manoeuvrability suffers greatly).\n\nIn case if the Etendard were to fall under 800 km/h, the only way to survive is either through regaining energy and run away, or pop out flaps. The Etendard is a jet that requires a pilot to use their flaps properly. This way, the Etendard can outturn its majority of opponents. Just be careful to not lose all of its energy. The key to using flaps for the Etendard is as follows:\n\n* Above 850 km/h, don't use any flaps, as flaps decreases the Etendard's manoeuvrability at higher speeds\n* 600-850 km/h, pop out combat flaps\n* 300-550km/h, utilise takeoff flaps\n* 300 km/h and below, lower landing flaps\n\nThe above flaps guide for the Etendard is a necessary component of the Etendard, as this is the only way to maintain ideal and competitive manoeuvrability over other jets. However, it is remain important that a pilot retain most of their aircraft energy, and thus, don't overextend the Etendard's manoeuvring capability.\n\nThe Etendard has two 30 mm cannons mounted on the bottom side of the aircraft. This can throw off many players' aim, and the only way to resolve this issue is through practice. Another good way to compensate this is by setting the gun convergence around 400-600m with vertical targeting on. While this might help, practice remains necessary.\n\nThe aircraft's air-to-air missiles, while less able to lock and track enemies than missiles mounted by other aircraft above its rank, can be very effective against slow targets and unmanoeuvrable bombers such as the [[B-57A|B-57]], [[Tu-14T]] or the Israeli [[Vautour IIA (Israel)|Vautour IIA]] and [[Vautour IIN (Israel)|Vautour IIN]].\n\nApart from that, the Etendard has access to CCIP for its rockets and bombs, a rarity for 9.0 aircrafts. Other aircrafts that has access to CCIP or CCRP around 9.0 includes [[A32A]], both [[Buccaneer S.1]] and [[Buccaneer S.2|S.2]], and the [[Su-7B]]. Combining the flight performance of the Etendard and access to ballistic computers, this aircraft makes one of the most accurate and effective attacker of its BR, especially in Ground RB. This compensates for its limited suspended armaments compared to its more dedicated attacker peers.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nThe Dassault Etendard was developed from an aircraft initially intended for the French Air Force to participate in the competition for the best ground attack aircraft capable of operating from makeshift <!-- original word was \"artisanal\", so this interpretation may not be accurate --> runways.\n\nThis design was not chosen by NATO, which preferred the [[G.91 (Family)|Fiat G.91]]. The French Air Force also did not want it and preferred to wait until the end of the development of the Mirage III. However, the prototype built for the French Air Force caught the attention of the Navy, which requested a navalised prototype in 1956.\n\nA new engine was then added to it: the Atar 8 (Atar 9 without afterburner); an in-flight refuelling probe; new high lift devices; a new fuselage with a larger wing area; foldable wing tips; a new reinforced structure to support catapult launches and landings; and finally, an enlarged nose cone to fit the new '''Aida radar''' for aerial and ground target acquisition. In addition, a SAAB AX 26 toss-bombing and ballistic computer was incorporated into the design. 5 pre-production airframes were ordered by the French Navy in May 1957. On May 21, 1958, at Melun Villaroche, Jean-Marie Saget took charge of the plane. The Etendard flew as fast as the [[Super Mystere B2]] despite not having an afterburner.\n\nDassault would produce 90 copies in Mérignac (not counting the prototypes). From the Etendard IVM no.1 to no.69, deliveries were made from December 1961 to May 1965.\n\nThe Etendard IVM was gradually withdrawn from service from 1978, due to the introduction of the Super Etendard.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=etndard_4m Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Az7bIMUyQys|'''{{PAGENAME}}  - With Flying Colours To A First Stupid Ace''' - ''Napalmratte''|-n_KnfIDCCY|'''Fast Boi, But Not Fast Enough: {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''Spit_flyer''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[G.91 (Family)]]\n* [[Super Mystere B2]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Dassault_Étendard_IV|[Wikipedia] Dassault Étendard IV]]\n* [http://www.airvectors.net/aveten.html <nowiki>[Air Vectors]</nowiki> The Dassault Etendard & Super Etendard]\n* [https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/etendard/ <nowiki>[Dassault Aviation]</nowiki> Etendard]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dassault}}\n{{France jet aircraft}}"}}
