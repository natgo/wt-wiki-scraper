It was introduced in [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]].\n\nThe F-104S.ASA is an Italian supersonic interceptor based on the American [[F-104 (Family)|Lockheed F-104 \"Starfighter\"]] series. The external appearance is much the same besides the additional ventral fins, but as the final variant of the Starfighter family, it boasts the best speed and payload capacity of any F-104. It can be used as a high-speed ground attacker with a sizeable load of assorted bombs and rockets. Alternatively, it can be a deadly interceptor if equipped with air-to-air missiles. Unique among Starfighters is its ability to carry a pair of Selenia Aspide semi-active radar homing missiles.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Taking any critical damage in the F-104S.ASA will almost instantly cripple it, to the point where you will have to fly back to base, or be a sitting duck for the enemy team. Taking a critical hit to the fuselage will disable you so badly you won't be able to reach supersonic speeds, which is your greatest advantage. The same goes for taking any sort of wing damage or tail damage: it will instantly result in a huge amount of drag on the air frame, reducing your already poor energy retention in manoeuvres making you an easy target to pick off from afar and in effective gun range. Lastly, the engine is a massive target for guns and missiles alike. Having a slightly orange engine will effectively put you out of the fight. And with the already heavy weight of the F-104S.ASA, you require the engine power to stay in the fight.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe one thing the F-104S.ASA does extremely well is speed, it is one of the vehicle's greatest advantage, and can be used to great effect if the pilot is careful about choosing which engagements to pursue. It is recommended to keep up a high air-speed at all times, which will allow the F-104S.ASA to swoop in and out of the combat zone while evading enemies. Sometimes, it is even possible to outrun enemy air-to-air missiles.\n\nHowever, the F-104S.ASA struggles with manoeuvrability. With such small wings, it simply can't produce the lift necessary to throw itself around the sky, and therefore has a very poor turning circle. This means that any turning engagement is most likely futile, and also re-emphasises the utility of a boom and zoom playstyle.\n\nWhen used in conjunction with its speed, the available armaments really allow the F-104S.ASA to shine. The AIM-9Ls, already difficult to dodge with their good manoeuvrability and flare-resistance, become nigh-on impossible to avoid when launched at supersonic speeds, particularly against much slower targets. The Selenia Aspide can also be a welcome addition in a high-altitude, long-range, all-aspect engagement however you will have to compromise for the 20mm Vulcan. Speaking of which, the extremely accurate and powerful M61A1 Vulcan cannon can be used instead for quick head-ons and to mop any remaining opponents at close-range.\n\nUnlike the F104S, the ASA is able to bring countermeasures to give it a fighting chance against the top dogs of the air. Your main enemies will be aircraft such as the [[F-14A Early|F-14 Tomcat]] or the [[MiG-27K|MiG-27]], it's best to try and avoid close engagements and instead focus on picking people from afar. As previously mentioned, you will not be able to turn well at high speeds so make sure that every person you engage won't become a threat if things don't go your way.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

The ASA is differentiated by the additions of the AIM-9L Sidewinder missile and the Italian Selenia Aspide semi-active radar homing missile. The avionics, countermeasure systems, and weapons were improved, however the cannon could not be carried along with the missile guidance equipment due to improvements in avionics. The ASA was also tested with Flare and Chaff pods, which was also one of the notable improvements over the S variant. The ASA would be updated once more beginning in 1995-1997 to the ASA/M standard. The changes were relatively minor and limited to the addition of modern AIM-9Ls, overhauling the electrical system, and adding new navigation features. These changes also resulted in a pure interceptor and therefore could not carry rockets or bombs.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f-104s_asa Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Ut1x2wooHgU|'''The Shooting Range #300''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 01:11 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* [[F-104S]]\n* [[F-104G (Italy)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/548752-f104-s-asa-and-its-missing-capabilities-wrong-radar-loadouts-and-more/\n* https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/history/f-104.html\n\n{{AirManufacturer Fiat}}\n{{Italy jet aircraft}}"}}
