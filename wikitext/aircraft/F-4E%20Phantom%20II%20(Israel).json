At first, the USA was unwilling to offer Israel the F-4, but developments in 1967-1968 led the USA to reconsider its position. Notably, a French embargo of Israeli aircraft and the defection of a Soviet MiG-21 convinced the USA to sell its F-4Es to Israel. The first of these aircraft arrived in January of 1968, nicknamed Kurnass (Heavy Hammer) in service.\n\nIsraeli Phantoms saw their first combat action in the War of Attrition (1967-1970) against Egypt, where they were used against Egyptian ground and air targets. During this time, more Phantoms continued to be delivered including six RF-4E reconnaissance Phantoms. During the Yom Kippur war, Israeli Phantoms were once again used against air and ground targets. This conflict also marked the debut of the AGM-65 Maverick in Israeli service shortly after the missile entered service with the USAF.\n\nIn total, Israeli Phantoms scored ~116 aerial kills against Arab aircraft between 1969-1982 compared to ~55 combat losses (total number disputed). The last Phantom was delivered in 1976, with a total of 204 aircraft delivered, including some as replacements for aircraft lost during the Yom Kippur war. In the last decades of the 20th century, the Phantom was complemented with newer aircraft such as the F-15 and F-16; the last Israeli Phantom was retired in 2004.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n=== References ===\n\n* Aloni, S.
