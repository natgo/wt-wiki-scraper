The F-6 series is a Photo Reconnaissance modification of the P-51A, P-51B, P-51C, P-51D & P-51K. The exact number of P-51s converted to F-6s is not known, but it is believed to be around 500 units.<ref>http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_F-6_Mustang.html</ref>\n\nOther Members of this Family Include the F-6B-NA (35 Converted P-51A), F-6C-NT (Unknown Number of Converted P-51C), F-6D-NA/NT (283 Converted P-51D), and the F-6K-NT (163 Converted P-51K)\n\nIn-Game, the F-6C-NA is a P-51B-10-NA modified with a Malcolm Hood, which balloons outwards and increases both headroom & side visibility. The Malcolm hood was used mostly by the RAF and their Mustang III's, though American use of the Malcolm hood did occur, the majority remained with the original Canopy design.\n\n===[[wt:en/news/7655-development-battle-pass-vehicles-f-6c-10-nt-en|Devblog]]===\nThe first field modifications of the P-51 Mustang series for tactical photo reconnaissance appeared in the UK in 1941. In 1942, the United States began their conversion of P-51 Mustang fighters of various series into a reconnaissance fighter by equipping them with one or two bulky K-24 cameras manufactured by Kodak. These aircraft were used by the US Air Force, Britain, Australia, and were also delivered abroad under the Lend-Lease program. The reconnaissance Mustang was actively used during the Allied offensive in Europe, as well as in Tunisia and in the Pacifics.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=p-51c-10_france Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|IfxpIFoBLoc|'''Battle Pass: Armoured Elephant''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 01:52 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[P-51 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7655-development-battle-pass-vehicles-f-6c-10-nt-en|[Devblog] Battle Pass vehicles: F-6C-10-NT]]\n\n{{France fighters}}\n{{France premium aircraft}}\n<references />"}}
