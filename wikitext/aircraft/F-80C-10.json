It was introduced in [[Update 1.33]].\n\nThe F-80C-10's major performance upgrade from the A-5 is that it comes with WEP. This additional power significantly increases acceleration, allowing it to match that of the British Meteor series. It also allows for a last-resort method to escape if it happens to get jumped on. However, WEP only lasts for 1:40, and once that runs out, there is no thrust increase available.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nLike most American fighters, your best option to attack is Boom and Zoom. At the start of the match, fly out towards the edge of the map. Climb at 2-3 degrees until you have reached ~770 km/h (~420 knots) at ~910 metres (~3,000 ft), then zoom climb at 20-30 degrees. Once you have slowed down to 287 km/h (155 kt), continue to climb at a solid 10 degrees. Optimally, you should have between 3.7-4.9 km (12,000-16,000 ft) depending on how high the highest enemy is, before turning in towards the area of conflict (continue to climb or maintain altitude). Only once you have selected a target should you dive and make your pass. Always keep your energy high, whether it be speed or altitude. Because the F-80 is frequently uptiered, the best option is to dive on unsuspecting targets that are occupied engaging your teammates.\n\nDefensive flying, rolling scissors, and to some degree, turn fighting, are options with the hydraulic boosters upgrade, as the straight wing as compared to 9.0 jets with swept wings provides better manoeuvrability at medium speeds (463-648 km/h, 250-350 knots). Any higher and the control surfaces begin to stiffen, any lower and you risk stalling out first, as jets with higher BR generally have a better thrust-to-weight ratio.\n\nIf you are given an awkward firing angle (e.g.: your target is near ground level and you are diving at a steep angle) or you fail to destroy them on your first pass, slowly pull your aircraft back up into a straight vertical climb to recover as much altitude as possible. If you persist on knocking out your target, you risk crashing into the ground from control stiffening or getting strafed by another enemy because you are losing your energy in a dogfight.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The aircraft was created by a group of Lockheed engineers (headed by Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson) in only 143 days.\n\nThe first flight of the XP-80 prototype was performed in January 1944. The first production version, designated the P-80A Shooting Star, entered service in 1946. The P-80 became the first combat-capable jet aircraft to enter service with the USAAF.\n\n1947 saw the appearance of the next production version of the aircraft, the P-80B. The ninth production P-80A-1 was converted to a new prototype, designated the XP-80B. It had an Allison J33-A-17 turbojet engine producing 1,816 kg of thrust, equipped with a methanol-water injection system. The airfoil was thinner, but the skin's thickness was increased. To install a water mixture tank, the plane's fuel quantity had to be sacrificed by reducing it from 1,781 to 1,610 liters The aircraft also received a Lockheed-designed ejection seat and a cockpit air-conditioning system.\n\nThe plane's armament consisted of six 12.7 mm Colt-Browning M3 machine guns with 300 rounds each in the forward fuselage. One 1,000 lb (454 kg) bomb or ten 5-inch (127 mm) unguided HVAR missiles could be suspended under each wing panel.\n\nA total of 240 P-80B fighter-bombers were built from March 1947 to March 1948, including P-80B-1s and 31 P-80B-5s. The В-5 variant was intended to be operated in Arctic conditions; its heated canopy prevented icing. In addition, special types of oil and special rubber were used to operate the aircraft in low temperature conditions.\n\nAt least five P-80Bs were equipped with a guidance system for Bell GAM-63 RASCAL air-to-surface missiles. Externally, these aircraft differed in the shape of the forward fuselage and the wing-mounted tanks. Also, they were fitted with extra spoilers on the upper and lower wing surfaces.\n\nIn June 1948, when the US military aircraft designation system was changed, the P-80B was renamed to the F-80B.\n\nWhen the Korean War started, F-80Bs were stationed in the USA and in Europe, being used by the USAAF mainly for training purposes. Later, 117 F-80Bs were brought up to the F-80C's standards and re-designated \"F-80C-12\". The remaining F-80Bs were withdrawn from service by the end of 1951.\n\n=== Notable pilots ===\n[[File:Robin_Olds_portrait.jpg|thumb|none|250px|link=User:U64962917#Olds,_Robin.|When United States ace pilot [[User:U64962917#Olds, Robin|Robin Olds]], showed up for a staff position and was told \"to go find something to do\", he opted to performed his own flight check (and first flight in a jet) in a '''P-80''' without prior authorization.]]\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f-80 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|hsKso9foSBA|'''Using Speed To Carry - F-80C-10''' - ''DEFYN''|6gS4gEoB0fI|'''Adapting To The Situation - F-80C-10 Commentary''' - ''DEFYN''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[F-80A-5]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/264991-lockheed-f-80c-10/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lockheed}}\n{{USA jet aircraft}}"}}
