If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe F-84F has the somewhat common base armament of 6 x M3 Browning machine guns. This combined with its large ammo capacity makes for an aircraft well-suited to dogfighting. Achieving air superiority should be the primary task for all F-84F pilots, the F-84F also excels in a support role, where most of enemies can't simply run away from it. In air battles, it has access to an air spawn, which means that you are able to engage enemies more quickly, giving the F-84F a very aggressive type of play-style. It is recommended to bring minimal fuel to boost its acceleration and climb rate, do note that bringing a lot of payload will seriously affect your overall mobility, the more payload the heavier, and slower, the aircraft is. If you are inclined to bring a lot of payload, make sure you dispose of it before entering a dogfight, as more often than not you will be knocked out as your flight characteristics won't be on par with most enemies you'll face. When the first enemies engage with allies, go over them and find targets with low energy states and destroy them. Do not chase lone planes, as although the enemy might look like easy 1v1 victory, the F-84F's low top speed makes it very hard to catch somebody. Try not to engage in a prolonged dogfight, because the F-84F has rather poor energy retention and when caught slow even good acceleration won't save the plane. In a prolonged turn fight, one may find themselves losing even against jets like the MiG-15. Another thing is that you have an adequate amount of munitions, so in theory you could stay in combat for a long time if you time your shots and selectively engage enemies you have the edge over. Destroying bombers and attackers is also a feasible option thanks to the powerful armament.\n\nThe aircraft can also be employed in ground strike or destruction of enemy bases with its more than sufficient maximum bomb load of 4 x 1,000 lb Mk.83 bombs and somewhat less impressive selection of 24 HVAR rockets.\n\n===Radars===\n<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->\nThe F-84F is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\nIt will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | AN/APG-30 - Rangefinding radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The maximum range at which a target can be tracked}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The range below which targets cannot be tracked by the radar}}\n! {{Annotation|Azimuth Tracking<br/>Angle|How far to each side the radar can track a target}}\n! {{Annotation|Elevation Tracking<br/>Angle|How far up and down the radar can track a target}}\n|-\n| 2,750 m || 300 m || ±9° || ±9°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

As a result, it developed a new variant of the Thunderjet, designated F-84F. The new aircraft featured, among other changes, a new swept wing and a more powerful engine than its predecessor. Although Republic initially intended the new aircraft to be an extensive modernization of the base F-84, possessing a high degree of part compatibility with preceding variants, in the end, only less than 20% of the parts were interchangeable, resulting in the F-84F Thunderstreak becoming its own independent design.\n\nFollowing its maiden flight in the early 1950's, the F-84F was ordered into production. However, the USAF focus on strategic bombers at the time resulted in some critical component manufacturing processes being prioritized for bomber production, ultimately leading to a staggered production start of the new F-84F.\n\nThe Thunderstreak officially entered service with the USAF in 1954, but was quickly phased out of active service due to engine issues before being reactivated in the early 1960's as tensions between the two superpowers began to rise again. Ultimately, the F-84F kept flying under American colors well into the early 1970's before finally being retired as newer aircraft replaced the Thunderstreak in active service.\n\nThe F-84F was also widely exported to NATO members. Chiefly among them were Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, China, the Netherlands as well as others. In total, well over 2,100 F-84F Thunderstreaks were built, with the Greek Air Force being the last to retire their F-84Fs in 1991.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/510660-f-84f-thunderstreak/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Republic}}\n{{Italy jet aircraft}}"}}
