The six machine guns altogether can make even a half-second hit on an enemy plane crippling for the enemy's modules.\n\nThe 12.7 mm machine gun can also be quite versatile in Air RB, as the M3 Browning has enough penetration power with ''Default'' and ''Ground Target'' belts to destroy light pillboxes.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Though not inconsequentially small, the payloads do impact the F-86F-30's flight characteristics enough that it is not suggested to use them in a fighter role at all if equipped with ordnance.\n\nUse rockets on battlefields with many lightly-armoured vehicles, while bombs against hard points like a well dug-in tank.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nWhile the F-86F-30's acceleration and top speed are lacking compared to its contemporaries, the F-86F-30's slats allow the plane to have an outstanding manoeuvrability. That said, one must beware of their speed as pulling high manoeuvres at high and max speed can put the plane under great stress which leads to the wings falling apart. The outstanding manoeuvrability comes at the cost of speed. Pulling hard turns will bleed your airspeed. Try to climb up before engaging the enemy to ensure you have enough energy to get out of a sticky situation. Hopefully, there will be a furball underneath you where you would be able to pounce on low-energy fighters with your guns. One advantage the F-86 has over the jets of other nations is the large ammo count of its 6 x 50 cals (1,800) although it would be wise to hit most of your shoots. Try staying above 500 km/h as any slower and you would lose a significant amount of energy in a pro-longed turn.\n\n=== Radars ===\n<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->\nThe F-86F-30 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\nIt will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target.

Between December 1954 to June 1961, the ROCAF received 160 surplus American F-86F-1 to F-86F-30 aircraft, and by 1958, the ROCAF possessed 320 such aircraft. The aircraft would engage in air combat with Chinese MiGs over the Taiwan Strait during the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1958. Additionally, ROCAF Sabres were among the first aircraft to be equipped with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, which were used with devastating effectiveness against Chinese MiGs during the Taiwan Strait Crisis.\n\nFollowing the end of the Chinese Civil War, the ROCAF received the F-86F series jet fighter from the United States, being surplus USAF airframes. The ROCAF received 160 airframes between December of 1954 to June of 1956, with further aircraft delivered afterwards contributing to a total of 320 F-86F aircraft. These aircraft were mostly upgraded to F-86F-40 standards. ROCAF F-86Fs engaged Communist MiG-15s and MiG-17s during the 1958 Taiwan Strait Crisis. During the crisis, Communist MiGs shot down or damaged 42 ROCAF aircraft but lost 15 of their own.\n\nHowever, the Taiwanese F-86F introduced a new weapon to the realm of aerial warfare - air-to-air missiles. In 1958, under Operation Black Magic, the United States equipped Taiwanese F-86Fs with the newly-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder. Each aircraft was fitted with two Sidewinders on underwing launch racks, which were used with considerable success against Chinese MiGs over the Taiwan Strait. ROCAF F-86Fs were the first aircraft to fire the missile in combat and achieved the first air-to-air missile kills on September 24th 1958, when multiple MiG-17s were shot down using the new weapon.\n\nThe AIM-9 Sidewinder severely undermined the air superiority of the Chinese MiG-17s, which had better thrust-to-weight ratio, vertical performance and climb rate than the ROCAF F-86s. The AIM-9 changed this, as Sabre pilots could engage with Chinese MiGs without needing to reach a similar altitude. However, while the AIM-9's deployment was a considerable setback for the PLAAF, the situation changed when a Chinese MiG-17 returned to base with an unexploded AIM-9B lodged in its airframe. The missile was given to Soviet technicians, and subsequently reverse-engineered into the R-3 series of missiles.\n\n=== Sabre in ROCAF ===\nIt's questionable if ROCAF received stock F-86F-40 or actually F-86F-30 with F-40 modification kits. The service history and combat history, including tales of firing Infrared guided air-to-air missiles would be covered in the page of ROCAF F-86F-40:\n\n{{Main|F-86F-40_(China)#History|l1=History of the F-86F-40 (China)}}\n\n===In-game plane details===\nThe F-86F-30 depicted in-game is an F-86F-30-NA model with the serial number 52-4589.\n\n52-4589 was issued to the 4th Fighter Wing towards the last weeks of the Korean War, flown by 1Lt Edwin Scariff from the 334th Fighter Squadron under the name ''JACKIE'S BOY'' with tail number \"FU-589\".<ref name=\"ThompsonF86Aces\">Thompson 2006, p.95</ref> In 1954, 52-4589 was given to the Republic of China Air Force (RoCAF) renamed as F-86011 \"011\".<ref name=\"ThompsonF86Aces\" /><ref name=\"RoseFJWBR\">Rose 2018</ref><ref name=\"YocumRoCAF\">Yocum 2017</ref> 52-4589 served in the No.17 squadron of the 5th Fighter Group,<ref name=\"YocumRoCAF\">Yocum 2017</ref> which transitioned to using the F-86 in January 1955.<ref name=\"LiRoCAF\">Li 2019, p.27</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f-86f-30_china Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* North American [[F-100D|F-100]] Super Sabre\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Dassault [[Super Mystere B2|Super Mystère]]\n* Grumman [[F9F (Family)|F9F]] Cougar\n* Hawker [[Hunter (Family)|Hunter]]\n* Lavochkin [[La-15]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-15 (Family)|MiG-15]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-17 (Family)|MiG-17]]\n* Saab [[J29D|J29]] Tunnan\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/272062-north-american-f-86f-30/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== References ===\n;Citations\n<references />\n\n;Bibliography\n* Baugher, Joseph F. \"F-86F in Foreign Service.\" ''<nowiki>joebaugher.com</nowiki>'', 05 NOV 1999, [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p86_12.html Website].\n* Li, Jordan.
