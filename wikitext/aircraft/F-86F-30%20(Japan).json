If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nWhile the F-86F-30's acceleration and top speed are lacking compared to its contemporaries, the F-86F-30's slats allow the plane to have an outstanding manoeuvrability. That said, one must beware of their speed as pulling high manoeuvres at high and max speed can put the plane under great stress which leads to the wings falling apart. The outstanding manoeuvrability comes at the cost of speed. Pulling hard turns will bleed your airspeed. Try to climb up before engaging the enemy to ensure you have enough energy to get out of a sticky situation. Hopefully, there will be a furball underneath you where you would be able to pounce on low-energy fighters with your guns. One advantage the F-86 has over the jets of other nations is the large ammo count of its 6 x .50 cals (1,800) although it would be wise to try and hit most of your shots. Try staying above 500 km/h as any slower and you would lose a significant amount of energy in a prolonged turn.\n\n=== Radars ===\n<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->\nThe F-86F-30 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\nIt will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target.

Following the disbanding of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy in 1945, this decision was written into law in the 1947 Constitution. While the original article declared that Japan would never resort to war as an instrument to settle disputes and would never maintain land, sea or air forces or other instruments of war, later on the exact meaning of this article was questioned by successive governments as it meant Japan was fully dependent on the occupying Allied forces to come to its defence in case of an armed conflict. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 only furthered this concern, and a new interpretation of the constitutional article came into being: while Japan was prohibited from maintaining an offensive force, the article did not state that they were also prohibited from maintaining a purely defensive force.\n\nThe formal establishment of a mutual defence clause in the 1951 US-Japan Peace treaty led to the founding of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954, with the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force being its air component. As a result of negotiations concerning the founding of the JASDF, it was eventually decided that the new armed force would use the North American F-86F as its standard day-fighter, with license production being undertaken by Mitsubishi in the form of assembly of knock-down kits produced by the North American factory in California. However, as it would take time for production to start, the decision was taken to hand over USAF aircraft to the nascent JASDF pending the arrival of the first domestically-produced F-86Fs. This first delivery included 30 North American F-86F Sabres and 55 Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star jet-trainers.\n\nThe official handover of the first seven F-86Fs for the JASDF took place at Kisarazu Base on December 1st 1955; the last of the 30 aircraft was handed over four months later in April of 1956. This first tranche of 30 aircraft, consisting of 10 F-86F-25-NHs and 20 F-86F-30-NAs, was originally used as a stop-gap pending the delivery of the F-86F-40 variant intended for the JASDF. These aircraft served to equip the 1st Air Wing, which was officially declared operational on October 1st 1956. In the four years they served as daylight fighters, 2 aircraft were written off in accidents. As soon as sufficient North American and Mitsubishi-produced Block-40 aircraft became available, the 28 surviving F-86F-25s and -30s were put into storage.\n\nThis was not the end of their story, as 18 aircraft were converted to RF-86F reconnaissance aircraft in 1961. These aircraft were used to equip the 501st Squadron where they would have a surprisingly long career: the last of these RF-86Fs were only withdrawn from service in 1979.\n\nThe following F-86Fs were transferred from the USAF to the JASDF:\n\n* F-86F-25-NH: 51-13361; 51-13368; 51-13369; 61-13376; 51-13385; 51-13390; 51-13414; 51-13474; 52-5327; 52-5439\n* F-86F-30-NA: 52-4542; 52-4618; 52-4679; 52-4684; 52-4693; 52-4699; 52-4705; 52-4708; 52-4745; 52-4758; 52-4836; 52-4844; 52-4845; 52-4905; 52-4909; 52-4913; 52-4914; 52-4916; 52-4923; 52-4939\n\nThese aircraft were (randomly) renumbered in JASDF service as 52-7401/7409 and 62-7410/7430. Aircraft later converted to RF-86F standard were renumbered from the x2-74xx to x2-64xx.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f-86f-30_japan Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* Canadair [[F-86 (Family)|Sabre]] (those Sabres manufactured with the designator \"CL\")\n* North American [[F-86K (France)|F-86D]] Sabre\n* North American [[F-100D|F-100]] Super Sabre\n* North American [[FJ-4B|FJ-4]] Fury\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Dassault [[Super Mystere B2|Super Mystère]]\n* Grumman [[F9F-8|F-9]] Cougar\n* Hawker [[Hunter F.1|Hunter]]\n* Lavochkin [[La-15]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-15]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-17]]\n* Saab [[J29D|J29]] Tunnan\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/272062-north-american-f-86f-30/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p86_12.html <nowiki>[Joe Baugher]</nowiki> F-86F in Foreign Service]\n\n{{Manufacturer MHI}}\n{{AirManufacturer NAA}}\n{{Japan jet aircraft}}"}}
