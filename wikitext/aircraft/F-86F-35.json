It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5924-development-shop-jet-packs-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/7417-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-in-gaijin-net-store-en|9th Anniversary Sale]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe {{PAGENAME}} boasts of a excellent speed compared to its other counterparts, at least until the [[Shenyang F-5]], [[MiG-17AS]] and [[Hunter FGA.9]] were released as premium vehicles. This aircraft was one of the first Premium jets available for sale, therefore it is unable to carry either air-to-air or air-to-ground missiles. Retaking on speed, this aircraft is quite fast in a straight line but loses a lot of energy and speed especially when facing a turn. Therefore, if in a pursuit, a precise shot with the [[M3 Browning (12.7 mm)]], can wreak havoc on an enemy aircraft. However, these machine guns aren't so powerful in the jet age when compared to 20 mm cannons, emphasizing the importance of firing accurately and making every shot count.\n\nThis Sabre fighter is an aircraft with a very special camouflage which identifies it as one of the U.S. Air Force Skyblazers, a USAF acrobatic team. The aircraft then is great in manoeuvres at high speed, which makes it a  good aircraft for air combat. You can also use it as well for ground attack if managing the 12 [[HVAR]] rockets it can carry. The only drawback to this manoeuvrability is that you lose quite a lot of speed in a turn. As well, the acceleration isn't great and makes the climb rate inferior to one of the other premium jets or other aircraft in its battle rating.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Along with this the F-86F-35's slats allow the plane to have an outstanding manoeuvrability. That said, one must beware of their speed as pulling high manoeuvres at high and max speed can put the plane under great stress which leads to the wings falling apart. The outstanding manoeuvrability comes at the cost of speed. Pulling hard turns will bleed your air speed. Try to climb up before engaging the enemy to ensure you have enough energy to get out of a sticky situation. Hopefully, there will be a chaotic fight underneath you where you would be able to pounce on low-energy fighters with your guns. One advantage the F-86 has over the jets of other nations is the large ammo count of its 6 x 50 cals (1,800) although it would be wise to hit most of your shots. Try staying above 500 km/h as any slower and you would lose a significant amount of energy in a pro-longed turn.\n\n=== Radars ===\n<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->\nThe F-86F-35 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\nIt will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target.

In 1950, it was deployed to Korea to combat the communist MiG-15s, and went on to score 560 kills to only 78 losses against the MiGs. Post-Korea, it went on to serve many other nations such as Pakistan, Taiwan, and Bolivia, the latter nation retiring its Sabres in 1994. Over 9,000 Sabres were built, including versions built in Canada and Australia, making the F-86 the most-produced Western fighter jet in military history.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f-86f-35 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|sYOTN08t_rc|'''The Pure Sabre Experience!
