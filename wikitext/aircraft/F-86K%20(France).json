It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 \"Imperial Navy\"]].\n\nThe original F-86D was developed as bomber interceptor and was outfitted with a retractable ventral rocket-rack which housed 24 x 2.75 in (70 mm) [[FFAR Mighty Mouse|Mighty Mouse]] folding-fin aerial rockets. Lacking cannons or air-to-air missiles, the F-86D was limited in role strictly as a bomber hunter.  In 1953 the Italians approached North American in an attempt to modify the existing F-86D into a fighter-interceptor, however, the proposed changes proved too costly. This cost overage required scaling back the requirements and from this was produced the F-86K, a fighter-interceptor aircraft which was outfitted with 4 x 20 mm cannons and two AIM-9B Sidewinder missiles. Originally this aircraft was produced for the U.S., however, later the Italian manufacturer Fiat was licensed to also manufacture and produce this version of the fighter.\n\n{{Quote\n|'''Fun Fact''': The Sabre Dog was initially to be designated F-95, but had its name changed to F-86D instead, in order to make it seem like a variant of the existing Sabre and not an entirely new aircraft. In reality, however, the F-86D was only about 25% similar to the original F-86 and the name change was only done to secure further support for the project.\n|  War Thunder Dev Blog\n}}\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe F-86K is a good aircraft at its rank, but not the best. The F-86K has very good low-end acceleration due to its afterburner, however, this aircraft is still only a subsonic fighter. Like every other jet, it's bad at manoeuvring at low speeds and its control surfaces compress at high speeds. However, the F-86K can handle top speed relatively well compared to other aircraft of its rank. If the F-86K can do one thing very well, it excels when going into vertical flight.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

The cockpit's frontal glass is made of 38 mm of bulletproof glass that helps against incoming small calibre rounds.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe F-86K should be used mainly as a support fighter, due to its sub-par manoeuvrability compared to other aircraft at its rank such as the MiG-17 at low speeds. In a 1 vs 1 dogfight, the F-86K outclassed when pitted against a MiG-17 unless you fight in a vertical, which this aircraft should do most of the time. When it comes to bomber hunting, this aircraft has four M24A1s, however these are also fantastic to use during a head-on attack. However, don't commit to head ons, instead fire a burst from maybe .8 km out then pull out. This is to decrease the chances of both of you crashing and increasing your chance of surviving. Your opponents will mainly be slightly lower-ranked aircraft like the MiG-15 Bis or F-86 A5 Sabre which you can easily out climb or outrun. However, sometimes you will get up-tiered to a higher rank and unfortunately, any thrust advantage is nullified when facing F-100s which are supersonic aircraft. There is a potential to be matched up against Hunter F.6s which can be armed with the devastating SRAAM missiles.\n\n===Radars===\n{{main|AN/APS-21}}\nThe F-86K is equipped with an [[AN/APS-21]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[AN/APS-21]] - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Guaranteed<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, detection of a target is practically guaranteed}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n|-\n| 45,000 m || 28,000 m || ±85° || ±16°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The new design was the first interceptor developed to be operated by a single crew member and utilized unguided rockets in combination with a complex fire control system, rather than conventional guns, in order to destroy its target. Already by April, the project had received official endorsement from high-ranking military officials and development of a production version began in parallel.\n\nWhile a production contract was signed in October, the first prototype, designated YF-95, conducted its maiden flight in December 1949. In the early '50s, Soviet nuclear testing and the subsequent start of the Korean conflict led to an accelerated development of the YF-95. Despite this, problems during development caused production to be delayed, resulting in the aircraft reaching its first units only in March 1951. During the delay however, the designation of the aircraft changed to F-86D and it received its unofficial nickname \"Sabre Dog\".\n\nIn January 1953, North American was approached by an offer from the Italian military to develop a twin-seater version of the F-86D armed with cannons. As the cost and necessary redesign work turned out to be too great, an agreement was made to produce the aircraft in its original design, but with cannon armament and a simplified fire control system instead. This new export version of the Sabre Dog received the new designation of F-86K.\n\nInitially, the F-86K was produced exclusively in the U.S., but would later also be manufactured under licence by the Italian Fiat company. The F-86 entered service in 1955 and apart from the Italian Air Force, the F-86K also served with many other operators worldwide including France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Honduras, Venezuela. Around 340 F-86Ks were produced out of over 2,800 Sabre Dogs built in total. Most of the F-86Ks would be decommissioned by the late '60s, while some even went on to serve into the '70s.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6176-development-f-86k-sabre-dog-the-grand-tourist-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f-86k_late Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"150\">\nImage:F-86k_img1.jpg|\nImage:F-86k_img2.jpg|\nImage:F-86k_img3.jpg|\nImage:F-86k_img4.jpg|\nImage:F-86k_img5.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|EblcQD-cZSY|'''The Sabre That Isn't Really A Sabre''' - ''Spit_flyer''|NuacwZrhw3M|'''The Shooting Range #159''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the F-86K (France).}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* Canadair [[F-86 (Family)|Sabre]] (Sabres manufactured with the designator \"CL\")\n* North American [[F-86 (Family)|F-86A/F]]\n* North American [[F-100D|F-100]] Super Sabre\n* North American [[FJ-4B|FJ-4]] Fury\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Grumman [[F9F-8|F9F]] Cougar\n* Lavochkin [[La-15]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-15]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-17]]\n* Hawker [[Hunter F.1|Hunter]]\n* Dassault [[Super Mystere B2|Super Mystère]]\n* Saab [[J29D|J29]] Tunnan\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6176-development-f-86k-sabre-dog-the-grand-tourist-en|[Devblog<nowiki>]</nowiki> F-86K Sabre Dog: The Grand Tourist]]\n* [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p86_17.html [joebaugher<nowiki>.com]</nowiki> North American F-86K Sabre]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/453521-f-86k/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer NAA}}\n{{France jet aircraft}}"}}
