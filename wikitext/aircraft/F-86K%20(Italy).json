In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]].\n\nThe original F-86D was developed as bomber interceptor and was outfitted with a retractable ventral rocket-rack which housed 24 x 2.75 in (70 mm) [[FFAR Mighty Mouse|Mighty Mouse]] folding-fin aerial rockets. Lacking cannons or air-to-air missiles, the F-86D was limited in role strictly as a bomber hunter.  In 1953 the Italians approached North American in an attempt to modify the existing F-86D into a fighter-interceptor, however, the proposed changes proved too costly. This cost overage required scaling back the requirements and from this was produced the F-86K, a fighter-interceptor aircraft which was outfitted with 4 x 20 mm cannons and two AIM-9B Sidewinder missiles. Originally this aircraft was produced for the U.S., however, later the Italian manufacturer Fiat was licensed to also manufacture and produce this version of the fighter.\n\n{{Quote\n|'''Fun Fact''': The Sabre Dog was initially to be designated F-95, but had its name changed to F-86D instead, in order to make it seem like a variant of the existing Sabre and not an entirely new aircraft. In reality, however, the F-86D was only about 25% similar to the original F-86 and the name change was only done to secure further support for the project.\n|  War Thunder Dev Blog\n}}\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe F-86K is a good aircraft at its rank, but not the best. The F-86K has very good low-end acceleration due to its afterburner, however, this aircraft is still only a subsonic fighter. Like every other jet, it's bad at manoeuvring at low speeds and its control surfaces compress at high speeds. However, the F-86K can handle top speed relatively well compared to other aircraft of its rank. If the F-86K can do one thing very well, it excels when going into vertical flight.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nThe plane is equipped at the front with a 6.35 mm steel plate protecting the pilot's wrist and up. The cockpit's frontal glass is made of 38 mm of bulletproof glass that helps against incoming small calibre rounds. All the while the pilot's seat is made of 12.7 mm of steel which protects his back of any incoming small calibre rounds and shrapnel.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe F-86K should be used mainly as a support fighter, due to its sub-par manoeuvrability at low speeds compared to other aircraft at its rank such as the [[MiG-17]]. In a 1 vs 1 dogfight, the F-86K is outclassed when pitted against a MiG-17 unless you fight in the vertical. When it comes to bomber hunting, this aircraft has four 20 mm M24A1 cannons which is more than enough, but you will sadly almost never see a bomber. These are also fantastic to use during a head-on attack, but don't commit to head-ons. Instead, fire a burst from maybe .8 km out then pull out. This is to decrease the chances of both of you crashing. Your opponents will mainly be other similarly tiered aircraft, such as the [[F-86F-2]] and [[J32B]].\n\nThe 2 x AIM-9Bs are perfect for the rare chance you see a bomber, or if someone is trying to run away from you. However, these should never be used against a plane that is actively turning due to the poor tracking rate.\n\n=== Radars ===\n{{main|AN/APS-21}}\nThe F-86K is equipped with an [[AN/APS-21]] search radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[AN/APS-21]] - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Guaranteed<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, detection of a target is practically guaranteed}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n|-\n| 45,000 m || 28,000 m || ±85° || ±16°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Many foreign countries wanted a high altitude interceptor. This need was created by the Soviet bomber threat many Western countries feared of. The U.S. felt the F-86D would be the perfect candidate for NATO countries, however, they didn't give the F-86D away. This was due to sensitive material the F-86D possessed, especially the state-of-the-art fire control system. Not only was the fire control system sensitive info, but it was also unreliable and the U.S. did not want to give unreliable equipment to other NATO countries. So the U.S. came up with the F-86K, an almost exact copy of the F-86D other than an improvised fire control and a slightly longer nose. After the F-86K was designed, production started with NAA (North American Arms) making around a hundred F-86Ks. These were shipped to NATO countries and Italy, but the U.S. also sent sets of parts to Italy around 1956. Fiat took these sets and assembled their own F-86Ks. Some of the Fiat assembled F-86Ks were shipped to France or other NATO countries. Italy continued to use F-86Ks up until they started to slowly get rid of them starting 1964 to make space for the F-104 Starfighter. The last Italian F-86K was decommissioned in 1973.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f-86k_late_italy Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|NuacwZrhw3M|'''The Shooting Range #159''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the F-86K (France).}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* Canadair [[F-86 (Family)|Sabre]] (those Sabres manufactured with the designator \"CL\")\n* North American [[F-86 (Family)|F-86A/F]]\n* North American [[F-100D|F-100]] Super Sabre\n* North American [[FJ-4B|FJ-4]] Fury\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Grumman [[F9F-8|F9F]] Cougar\n* Lavochkin [[La-15]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-15]]\n* Mikoyan-Gurevich [[MiG-17]]\n* Hawker [[Hunter F.1|Hunter]]\n* Dassault [[Super Mystere B2|Super Mystère]]\n* Saab [[J29D|J29]] Tunnan\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p86_17.html [joebaugher<nowiki>.com]</nowiki> North American F-86K Sabre]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/453521-f-86k/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Fiat}}\n{{Italy jet aircraft}}"}}
