Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n''Air battles''\n\nThe F.C.20 Bis is an attacker, very good at its BR. At the beginning of the battle, attack ground targets or climb to altitude and attack bombers, attackers and interceptors. Your 37 mm cannon is very powerful, even one shot can destroy a plane, in fact the 37 mm cannon can be used against ground targets with armour. If an enemy plane is approaching to attack you from behind, use your rear [[Scotti (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm Scotti machine gun]] with the universal belt that contains 2 AP-I bullets and 2 API-T bullets per belt.\n\nUse the tracer ammunition belt that contains 4 API-T bullets per belt for the [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT]] offensive machine gun. For the [[Breda Model 39 37/54 (37 mm)|37 mm Breda Model 39 37/54]], use the air targets belt that contains 4 HEF-T bullets per belt against enemy aircraft, and the armoured targets belt that contains 4 APHE bullets per belt against ground targets. The later belt is good because it has a post-penetration damage that increases the damage caused by these shots.\n\n''Ground battles''\n\nWhen using the F.C.20 Bis in mixed ground battles, use the following payloads: 2 x [[SAP 100M (100 kg)|SAP 100M]] or 2 x AP 160. After spawning with the F.C.20 Bis, increase your altitude and dive to drop your bombs with greater accuracy. Set the fuse on the bombs to a minimum of 1 to 1.5 seconds.. After delivering your bombs, gain some altitude and perform dive attacks with the Breda Model 39 37/54 to shoot through the top of ground vehicles where you can easily penetrate them and cause damage or destroy them.\n\n''Naval battles''\n\nYou can use the F.C.20Bis in land mode, use the following payloads: 2x [[SAP 100M (100 kg)|SAP 100M]] or 2x AP 160. Set the fuse on the bombs to assault fuse, after you spawn with the F.C.20 Bis, increase your altitude and choose a naval target. After selecting it, fly in its direction until you're above, perform a vertical dive attack. While you are diving, evade the AA shots and after positioning yourself perpendicularly on the enemy ship, try to drop the bombs in the vital points of the ship (turrets, bridge, engine bay), then fly away, dodging anti-aircraft fire.\n\n'''AB mode'''\n\nIn arcade mode, you can attack ground targets or you can dogfight with enemy planes with your manoeuvrability. Make sure that no one is behind you because if a fighter comes from behind you can not easily defend yourself.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

Rosatelli on the CR.25, he decided, in order to reduce design time, to adopt for the new aircraft the side wings, engines and undercarriage of the twin-engine FIAT.\n\nThus the F.C.20 (FIAT CANSA 20) was built and was proposed to the Regia Aeronautica in competition with the Caproni-Bargamasche Ca.331, AUT.45 of the Aeronautica Umbra, Ambrosini SAI.9 and IMAM Ro.61.\n\nThe Aeronautical Administration ordered two examples of Ca.331, AUT.45 (later cancelled) and F.C.20, the order was communicated to CANSA and on 15 October 1938 the two prototypes were assigned serial numbers MM 403 and MM 404.\n\nThe F.C.20 continued its evaluation cycle at Guidonia, without arousing any particular enthusiasm and probably would have been abandoned if, at the request of the new Chief of Staff General Fouger, the competition for an assault and ground attack aircraft had not been announced together with that for a twin-engine dive-bombing aircraft.\n\nCANSA immediately saw the chance to save its aircraft and immediately undertook the transformation of the two prototypes.\n\nNew versions of the F.C.20 were thus born, one of which, the '''F.C.20Bis''', was to be a a true remake of the original aircraft. The most noticeable renovations were in the fuselage, which underwent extensive structural and architectural modifications.\n\nThe crew area was protected by armouring the front fuselage, the rear turret, the floor and the pilot's seat. The crew was reduced to only two persons: pilot and gunner-radio operator.\n\nThe armament consisted of a Breda Model 39 37/54 gun from two [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT]] machine guns fixed in the fighter with 350 shots each, and a [[Scotti (12.7_mm)|12.7 mm \"Scotti\"]] mounted in a Caproni Lanciani Delta E dorsal turret with 500 shots.\n\nIn addition to the 250 kg wing attachments, the installation of a \"Nardi\" ventral splitter with 2 kg anti-personnel bombs was also planned, but it does not appear that this was installed.\n\nOther variants:\n\n* F.C.20\n* F.C.20Ter\n* F.C.20Quater\n\n'''Italian military service'''\n\nFew production FC.20Bis were built and it is known that three served the 174th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron in July 1943 but were not used operationally. Italian military operations ceased with the armistice of September 1943.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fc_20_bis Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[Ki-45 (Family)|Ki-45]]\n* [[Bf 110 C-6]]\n* [[XA-38]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/504173-cansa-fc20-bis/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Fiat}}\n{{Italy strike aircraft}}"}}
