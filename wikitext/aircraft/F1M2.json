It has surprisingly good manoeuvrability, decent armament, as well as the ability to land on water due to its floatplane design. All in all, it is a fun aircraft to fly in both air and naval battles.\n\n'''Air battles''':\n\nThe F1M2 would seem to be a relatively bad fighter, given that it has massive floats. However, the opposite is actually true. The F1M2 is very capable as a fighter, and has very impressive manoeuvrability for an aircraft of its type. However, be aware that the large, heavy floats result in a worse turning circle than most dedicated biplane fighters such as the [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]], [[He 51 (Family)|He-51]] or [[Fury Mk I|Fury]]. Though the F1M2 is still an able turner and can keep up with some fighters such as the [[P-26 (Family)|P-26]], pursuing a direct fighter engagement is not advised as it is generally a bit worse than dedicated fighter aircraft. As well, the F1M2 is rather slow, so don't expect it to outrun anything (other than extremely slow aircraft like the [[Po-2]] or [[Swordfish Mk I|Swordfish]], of course).\n\nThe F1M2 is equipped with two 7.7 mm Type 97 machine guns which are quite adequate for tearing biplanes apart. However, these guns are relatively bad for everything else, and won't do much damage to aircraft built out of metal. Of course, most aircraft at its BR are wooden biplanes, so the weapon is quite adequate. As well, the F1M2 can carry two 60 kg bombs, which are more than enough to destroy any lightly-armoured targets. Finally, the F1M2 has an ace up its sleeve - the 7.7 mm defensive gun. This weapon is mounted on a flexible mounting at the rear, and is a potent anti-aircraft weapon. In general, due to its lack of powerful guns or suspended ordnance, the F1M2 should be played more as a \"heavy\" fighter, utilizing its great manoeuvrability, airspawn, and defensive armament.\n\n'''Naval battles''':\n\nNaval battles are the area where the F1M2 shines. Due to its floatplane design, it can easily cap bases by landing on them. When flying in this capacity, beware of any PT boats in the nearby area, and never land when there are enemy vessels close by. Though most ships at its BR have little to no heavy armament, they are still very capable of shredding a plane sitting on the water - a literal sitting duck. As well, the F1M2 can use its 7.7 mm machine guns and bombs against enemy torpedo boats, but this is generally rather ineffective. The 7.7 mm MGs are rather bad at doing heavy damage against PT boats, and the 60 kg bombs have to be dropped at extremely low altitudes in Naval RB to have good accuracy. Thus, in naval battles, it's best to play the F1M2 as an aircraft to quickly capture points.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was originally built as a catapult-launched reconnaissance floatplane specializing in gunnery spotting for battleships and heavy cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nFlight tests of the first prototype Ka-17 (F1M1) aircraft (with a Nakajima Hikari 1 engine) were performed in June 1936. The tests showed that the seaplane had multiple issues, mostly having to do with poor directional stability. In addition, the F1M1's seaworthiness was doubtful.\n\nTwo years were spent performing a serious redesign. A new central float was built for the F1M, replacing the Nakajima E8N1 hydroplane float used on the prototypes. The Nakajima Hikari engine was replaced with a more powerful Mitsubishi Zuisei 13 fourteen-cylinder double-row air-cooled engine (the same as that used for Zero fighters) with a maximum take-off power of 875 hp.\n\nAn improved version of the hydroplane, designated as the Type 0 Observation Seaplane Model 11 (F1M2), began full-scale production in 1940.\n\nThe F1M2 was armed with two 7.7 mm Type 97 Model 3a synchronized fuselage-mounted machine guns with 500 rounds each, and one more 7.7 mm Type 97 (Lewis Mk.III) machine gun with 582 rounds (6 standard magazines) was mounted in the turret in the observer's cockpit to protect the rear of the plane from attacks from above. The lower wing panels had lugs installed to suspend two 60 kg, two 30 kg, or six 20 kg bombs.\n\nAt the beginning of the Pacific War, the F1M2s took part in the Battles for the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The seaplanes were launched from floating bases and later from battleships, cruisers, and coastlines. The Rei Kans were used as scouts, gunnery spotters, light bombers, and anti-submarine aircraft. In June 1942, they were used as dive bombers over the Aleutian Islands; they also covered the Japanese positions there from the air as sea fighters.\n\nA total of 1,118 F1M2s were manufactured, and their production was discontinued in March 1944. The aircraft remained in service until the end of the war.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f1m2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mitsubishi}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
