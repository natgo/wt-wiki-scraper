Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is pretty good in a dogfight with the right energy situation. While it may not be able to out-turn every enemy it faces, it has decent enough maneuverability to face the majority of the planes it faces. The plane does suffer from a relatively poor climb rate and below average top speed, but once it gains the altitude it needs to gain speed, it can be quite a fighting plane.\n\nThe 20 mm can cause a lot of damage if it does catch the enemy. One important note is to avoid large dogfighting furballs, as there will be an enemy Me 262 or other jet that will notice the large {{PAGENAME}} and aim to gun it down. Instead, use the {{PAGENAME}} to go against outliers and stragglers to deal with them one by one.\n\nIf the plane's flight performance is not to one's liking, one can use the {{PAGENAME}} as a ground-pounder. Allow teammates to gain an aerial superiority in the fighting area while using the guns and suspended armaments to attack ground units. The cannons are effective against light vehicles and vehicle top armour. The 2000 lb bombs are powerful enough to destroy any target, allowing pinpoint targeting of dug-in vehicles and end their game quickly. The {{PAGENAME}} also has access to Tiny Tim Rockets, which have extremely high penetration and post penetration damage. After dropping the payload and strafing targets, quickly return to base and rearm to return with more weaponry and effect.\n\nIt is best not to linger over a combat zone, as the {{PAGENAME}}'s presence will attract the attention of players, who may spawn in fighters or SPAA and try to shoot it down. In higher rank matches, SPAA will jump at the chance to shoot down a slow, lumbering jet like the {{PAGENAME}}. Instead, it is best to quickly pinpoint a target, destroy it and then return to base. Keep on doing this as many times as possible. Fly low and around the edge of the map in order to avoid any anti-aircraft guns, observing the map and looking out for any potential targets. If the {{PAGENAME}} has attracted any unwanted attention from an enemy aircraft, the first action should be to call for help. It can save a lot of hassle if a friendly SPAA or fighter can take out the enemy plane. If not, the {{PAGENAME}} pilot will need to analyse the enemy and work out if the {{PAGENAME}} has any advantages over it. If it is a high-rank plane like a MiG-15 or Sabre, the options are pretty limited. The {{PAGENAME}}'s survival chances mostly depend on the pilot's skill to outwit the opponent, or their skill to outwit the {{PAGENAME}}'s pilot.\n\n===Radars===\n{{main|AN/APS-21|AN/APG-26}}\nThe F3D-1 is equipped with an [[AN/APS-21]] search radar, as well as an [[AN/APG-26]] target tracking radar.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nIn late 1945, the US Navy was in search of a new carrier-based fighter that was to be jet-powered and able to fly in all weather. The two-seated, twin-engine fighter was to be equipped with a radar and with specifications for a top speed of 500 mph (805 km/h), an operating altitude of 40,000 ft (12,192 m),<ref name=\"BoeingF3D\" /> and able to detect an enemy 125 miles (201 km) away.<ref name=\"JoebaugherF3D\" /> The Douglas Aircraft Company were among the many companies that were asked to produce an aircraft able to meet these specifications. Led by designer Ed Heineman, Douglas produced the designs that the US Navy thought suited best and were offered a contract for three prototypes under the designation ''XF3D-1'', with the nickname '''Skyknight''', on 03 April 1946.<ref name=\"JoebaugherF3D\" />\n\nThe XF3D-1 prototype made its first flight on 23 March 1948.<ref name=\"CombatAirF3D\" /> Due to the favorable performance, the plane was then ordered on May 11th for production of 28 units as the '''F3D-1'''. The first production F3D-1 was delivered in early 1950.<ref name=\"JoebaugherF3D\" /> By February 1951, the F3D-1 was put into service. However, despite its status, the F3D-1 did not meet all standards for aircraft carrier operations, mainly due to underpowered engines.<ref name=\"CombatAirF3D\" /> As such, priority shifted over towards the F3D-2 variant and only 28 F3D-1 planes were produced.<ref name=\"JoebaugherF3D\" /> In all, Douglas would produce 268 F3D Skyknights for U.S. service.<ref name=\"BoeingF3D\" />\n\nWhile the F3D-1 stayed stateside to train pilots and radar operators, the F3D-2 were sent to the Korea War in Spring of 1952.<ref name=\"JoebaugherF3D\" /> The F3D-2 Skyknights were assigned to Marine Corps night fighter squadrons to escort bombers in nighttime raids.<ref name=\"CombatAirF3D\" /> While there, the F3D Skyknights racked up one of the best aerial victory record in Korea for a night-fighter, even scoring the first aerial jet-to-jet night victory against a [[Yak-15]] in 03 November 1952. Only one F3D Skyknight was shot down during the rest of the Korean War.<ref name=\"MilitaryFactoryF3D\" />\n\nAfter the Korean War, the F3D Skyknights became used as trainers or testing beds for the then-new air-to-air missiles (AAM) such as the AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. In the 1962, the F3Ds were renamed to the ''F-10'' Skyknights, with the F3D-1 and F3D-2 being redesignated as ''F-10A'' and ''F-10B'' respectively. These would later be used in Vietnam, making the Skyknights the only jet fighter to have flown in the Korean and Vietnam War. The Skyknight's role in Vietnam was reduced, focusing more on electronic warfare with electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment as the ''EF-10B'' in order to counter the new SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile. The Skyknights were also used to conduct reconnaissance over Cuba during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.<ref name=\"MilitaryFactoryF3D\" />\n\nIn 1969 though, all US Navy F-10s were retired and used for testing on the new avionics systems which were implemented into the F-14 Tomcats. The Marines used their F-10s until May 1970.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f3d_1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|76ArCiYaEog|'''The Shooting Range #81''' - ''War Machines'' section at 00:31 discusses the F3D-1.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/392616-douglas-f3d-1-skyknight/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Douglas_F3D_Skyknight|[Wikipedia<nowiki>]</nowiki> Douglas F3D Skyknight]]\n* [https://www.combatairmuseum.org/aircraft/douglasf3skyknight.html [Combatairmuseum<nowiki>.org]</nowiki> Douglas F-3D-2T2 (TF-10B) Skyknight]\n* [https://www.boeing.com/history/products/f3d-f-10-skyknight.page [Boeing.<nowiki>com]</nowiki> Historical Snapshot - F3D/F-10 SKYKNIGHT FIGHTER]\n* [http://www.airvectors.net/avskykt.html [Airvectors<nowiki>.net]</nowiki> The Douglas F3D Skyknight]\n* [http://www.joebaugher.com/navy_fighters/f10_1.html [<nowiki>Joebaugher.com]</nowiki> Douglas F3D-1/F-10A Skyknight]\n\n=== References ===\n\n<references>\n<ref name=\"BoeingF3D\">Boeing. \"Historical Snapshot: F3D/F-10 SKYKNIGHT FIGHTER.\" Boeing, [https://www.boeing.com/history/products/f3d-f-10-skyknight.page Website].</ref>\n<ref name=\"CombatAirF3D\">Combat Air Museum. \"Douglas F-3D-2T2 (TF-10B) Skyknight\" Combat Air Museum, [https://www.combatairmuseum.org/aircraft/douglasf3skyknight.html Website].</ref>\n<ref name=\"JoebaugherF3D\">Baugher, Joseph F. \"Douglas F3D-1/F-10A Skyknight\" joebaugher.com, 30 Jan. 2000, [http://www.joebaugher.com/navy_fighters/f10_1.html Website].</ref>\n<ref name=\"MilitaryFactoryF3D\">Military Factory. \"Douglas F3D-1/F-10A Skyknight\" Military Factory, 31 May 2016, [https://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=495 Website].</ref>\n</references>\n\n{{AirManufacturer Douglas}}\n{{USA jet aircraft}}"}}
