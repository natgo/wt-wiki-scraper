If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nDue to its great energy retention and high dive speed, the Corsair is very good at Boom and Zooming. It is recommended to be used this way, especially against any Japanese planes. Against any German planes BnZ is still recommended, but some planes you can out turn ([[Fw 190 A-4]]). As with every American fighter, always climb at the start of a match. The only way to be successful with this plane is to climb high and end up higher than the enemy. Using this tactic will greatly increase your chances of getting the enemy and forcing the enemy down low where you can finish them off.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the USMC Corsair's engine is optimized for operation at lower altitudes and climbs marginally faster in the lower altitudes than the F4U-1A due to the tweaking of the engine's capabilities. In addition to this, removal of the carrier landing equipment lightened the {{PAGENAME}} few hundred kilograms compared to the original F4U-1A, resulting in a slight advantage in manoeuvrability. This positively affects both the vertical and the horizontal manoeuvres along with providing slightly faster acceleration and a minor edge with its maximum speed.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This aircraft was designed from the outset as a carrier borne fighter. It featured an inverted gull wing to keep the huge propeller off the ground while keeping the landing gear short for carrier operations. Even after the completion and launch of the F4U-1, a number of problems were discovered which initially prevented the aircraft from being used as a carrier-based fighter such as bad stall characteristics due to the gull wing, no visibility over the nose for carrier landings and bouncing off the deck after landing. The Navy was forced to use the first F4U-1s for Marine Corps ground-based operations until January 1945 when most of these problems were overcome.\n\nIn the middle of 1943, the F4U-1A variant made its debut. To improve visibility, which was especially important when landing on an aircraft carrier, the cockpit canopy was modified to a convex shape, and the pilot's seat was raised 17.8 cm. Dive speed problems were solved with a stall strip just outboard of the gun ports on the starboard wing's leading edge.\n\nThe F4U-1A was produced not only at the Chance Vought factory, where the aircraft was designed but also at the Brewster and Goodyear factories (with the designations F3A-1A and FG-1A, respectively). The latter model differed in that its wings could not fold. The Chance Vought factory produced a total of 2,126 F4U-1As.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f4u-1a_usmc Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"200\">\nFile:F4U-1A (USMC) Rework Model.jpg|<small>Reworked model of the {{PAGENAME}}</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|g4R3iiCmiBQ|'''The Shooting Range #1''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:26 discusses the F4U Corsair.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/325083-f4u-1ausmccd/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vought}}\n{{USA fighters}}"}}
