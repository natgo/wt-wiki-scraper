The Corsair optimally performs with stealth ammunition loaded for best damage output, allowing an experienced pilot to take out several targets before returning to base and reloading. It is best to selectively aim for the most critical parts of an enemy plane if you want to maximise kill efficiency while you're in the sky. A few 20mm shells to an enemy engine or cockpit will destroy their plane with a little luck. While this may seem easier said than done, diving onto your opponent is almost a guaranteed kill, and if you are unlucky, you still have an incredibly impressive dive speed under your belt to keep you from being a target. While flying this plane, like any U.S. fighter, you'll be in the most danger when you are 'floored' (at a low altitude), since your only escape is diving.\n\nFacing mainly Japanese planes in Realistic Battles and Simulator Battles, it is important to note not to turn with A6M5s and the like, but to use Boom and Zoom tactics.\n\nThe quadruple AN/M2 armament of the Corsair can prove surprisingly effective against all manner of enemy vehicles. Ground target belts will make short work of light armour, but even heavier tanks like the Panther can be dealt with if the pilot attacks the roof from a steep enough angle, though it may take several passes. Diving from one to two thousand meters, as close as possible to the vertical, and hosing down the enemy will reliably cause engine fires and potentially knock out some or all of the turret crew. Using the Corsair's energy retention to regain altitude allows the pilot to repeat this process many times. With enough practice, the F4U-1C's bottomless ammo reserve will allow you to disable or outright destroy several enemies on the ground while maintaining enough energy to take on any aircraft to come your way.\n\nThe F4U-1C is an excellent plane in all game modes, however, be aware of the very restrictive cockpit, which makes it extremely difficult to spot targets in Simulator Battles, especially those behind you.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The F4U-1D Corsair was designed in order to meet the Navy's requirement for capable carrier-based fighter-bombers. To meet this need, the -1D incorporate a Pratt and Whitney R-2800-8W water injection engine, increasing the engine power and the plane's speed from that of the F4U-1A. This gave it the increased performance necessary to carry a larger armament. Two pylons were added to the center wing section, that could hold 154 gallon fuel tanks, bombs up to 1,000 lbs, or napalm bombs. Because of the ability to carry more fuel externally, the 63 gallon fuel tanks in the wing tips were removed. Later in production, the ability to carry four 5 in rockets under each wing was added. In addition, the propeller diameter was reduced from 13 ft 4 in to 13 ft 1 in.\n\nThe F4U-1C was basically the same as the F4U-1D, except in primary armament. The -4D had a primary armament of six .50 in machine guns, as was standard for most Corsair variants. The F4U-1C replaced the .50 in machine guns with four 20 mm cannons. When rocket tabs were added to the F4U-1D, they were also added to the F4U-1C. This allowed it to carry eight 5 in rockets, along with the bombs and/or fuel tanks. All of the F4U-1Cs were fitted with the smaller propeller, with a diameter of 13 ft 1 in, whereas the -1D did not change the propeller size until after production had already started.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Chance Vought F4U Le Corsaire. The F4U-1C \"Corsair\" was a single-seater, single-engine carrier-based fighter.\n\nThe unusual W-shaped wings of the F4U required propeller of a diameter of about four meters. Those were the biggest propellers ever used in a single-engine fighter. Therefore, a conventional wing would have required a significant extension of the landing gear, reducing their strength. So the Chance Vought designers decided to use a new wing design and keep the landing gear at a normal length. Wind tunnel tests proved the new wing design's effectiveness. To reduce weight and improve aerodynamics, the plane's design used spot welding.\n\nIn 1943, the F4U-1C variant was developed. It differed mainly from the F4U-1A in its armament: instead of six machine guns, the plane had four 20-mm cannons. Because of its low rate of fire, the new Corsair was used primarily to attack ground targets and for nighttime interceptions and took practically no part in aerial fighter combat.\n\nThe F4U-1C was produced on a relatively small scale. Only 200 were made.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n[[File:Reworked F4U-1C Model.jpg|thumb|none|350px|Reworked model of the '''{{PAGENAME}}'''.]]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[F4U (Family)|F4U Family]]\n* [[F4U-1A]]\n* [[F4U-1D]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/325083-f4u-1ausmccd/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n* \"[https://www.jdsf4u.be/f4u-1c-vought-corsair F4U-1C Vought Corsair]\", ''F4U Corsair - The Bent Wing Bird plane site'', Retrieved on 28 March 2020.\n* \"[https://www.jdsf4u.be/type-of-plane-f4u Types of Plane F4U - Variants]\", ''F4U Corsair- The Bent Wing Bird plane site'', Retrieved on 28 March 2020.\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vought}}\n{{USA fighters}}"}}
