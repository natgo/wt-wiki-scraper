In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe F4U-1D is a further development of the preceding [[F4U-1A]], featuring much improved performance thanks to a more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics. \n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe stock performance is not that great. The engine overheats extremely easily, even just at 100% throttle, and once it has overheated it takes a century to cool down. Don't even think about using WEP except takeoff or very extreme emergencies or else your engine will die. However, once spaded it can perform very well using Boom and Zoom tactics, and can even out turn some aircraft. It will quickly lose energy in a turn, so it is primarily an energy fighter.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,096 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nDue to its great energy retention and high dive speed, the Corsair is very good at Boom and Zooming. It is recommended to be used this way especially against any Japanese planes. Against any German planes Boom & Zoom is still recommended, but some planes you can out turn, such as the [[Fw 190 A-4]]. As with every American fighter, '''always''' climb at the start of a match. The only way to be successful with this plane is to climb high and end up higher than the enemy. Using this tactic will greatly increase your chances of getting air kills and forcing the enemy down low where you can finish them off.\n\nWhen you are diving on a Japanese plane and it turns around, do not follow it in the turn to get a couple shots off. Instead pull an Immelmann turn, and you will end up right on the tail of an opponent with a lot less energy while you still have a lot. The same tactic can work against German aircraft to an extent as well.\n\nSuitable for both dog-fighting and ground attacking as the Corsair fulfils many roles.\n\nWith 8 rockets a great variety of targets can be taken care of. Four tanks of any size, if aimed well, four light pillboxes, or a single destroyer. 2,000 lbs (~1,000 kg for in-game purposes) deliver enough punch for 2/3 of a strategic base, or 1/2 Japanese Carrier.\n\n====== Simulator mode procedures ======\nHands-off carrier take-off (Auto engine control, no secondary weapons): Ignite engine, flaps: raised, elevator trim: 20%, aileron trim: 11%, rudder trim: 6%, WEP throttle, hands off controls until you get lifted off the ground.\n\n====Specific enemies worth noting====\n<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->\nWhen facing the Japanese, you always have to look out for A6Ms, Ki-61s, and Ki-43s. Against all past mentioned you should '''never''' turn-fight them, boom-and-zoom each and let your superior speed, energy retention, and dive speed save you.\n\nWhen facing the Germans or Italians, you have to be wary of Bf 109 F-4's and Bf 109 G-2's, each will outclimb you, outgun you, and accelerate faster than you. The best way to counter a 109 is to jump one that is on an teammate's tail, and pour your 6 x .50 cals into them. Unlike the Japanese planes, a 109 can take a lot of hits, and its fires can go out as well, so be wary. You do not have to worry much about Fw 190's, the only thing worth mentioning is to never head-on one, and if you do happen to get one on your tail, either out dive it or turn-fight it.\n\n====Counter-tactics====\n<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->\nThe best countermeasure against the F4U-1D is to outclimb it. If you do then it will be a sitting duck. If you are at the same altitude as it, try to engage it in a turn-fight if you have more energy than it (be mindful, a skilled pilot can make his F4U-1D out-turn the agile Bf 109 F-4).\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

To meet this need, the  -1D incorporate a Pratt and Whitney R-2800-8W water injection engine, increasing the engine power and the plane's speed from that of the F4U-1A. This gave it the increased performance necessary to carry a larger armament. Two pylons were added to the center wing section, that could hold 154 gallon fuel tanks, bombs up to 1,000 lbs, or napalm bombs. Because of the ability to carry more fuel externally, the 63 gallon fuel tanks in the wing tips were removed. Later in production, the ability to carry four 5 in rockets under each wing was added. In addition, the propeller diameter was reduced from 13 ft 4 in to 13 ft 1 in.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nWhen designing the single-engine carrier-based fighter-bomber designated as the Chance Vought F4U-1D Le Corsaire (\"The Corsair\"), it was decided to ignore the new weaponry from the F4U-1C and use six of the proven 12.7 mm machine guns (as had been on the F4U-1A).\n\nThe plane's main innovation was its capacity to hold two 454-kg bombs and one 907-kg bomb. Thus, the F4U-1D could be used as a heavy fighter-bomber. Also, additional fuel tanks could be installed instead of bombs. In addition, a more powerful engine was added, and the last 266 F4U-1Ds and 295 FG-1Ds could carry eight 127-millimeter HVAR rockets.\n\nThe F4U-1D, the first large-scale variant after the F4U-1A, was produced not only at Chance Vought factory, but also at the Goodyear factory. Planes from the latter became known as FG-1Ds. The Brewster plant, which had produced the F4U-1A, did not work on the production of this variant, as its contract was annulled.\n\nAll in all, 1685 F4U-1Ds were made at the Chance Vought factory and 1997 FG-1Ds at the Goodyear factory.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n[[File:F4U-1D Reworked Model.jpg|thumb|none|350px|Reworked model of the '''{{PAGENAME}}'''.]]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[F4U (Family)|F4U Family]]\n* [[F4U-1A]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/325083-f4u-1ausmccd/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* \"[https://www.jdsf4u.be/f4u-1d-vought-corsair F4U-1D Vought Corsair]\", ''F4U Corsair - The Bent Wing Bird plane site'', Retrieved on 28 March 2020.\n* \"[https://www.jdsf4u.be/type-of-plane-f4u Types of Plane F4U - Variants]\", ''F4U Corsair- The Bent Wing Bird plane site'', Retrieved on 28 March 2020.\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vought}}\n{{USA fighters}}"}}
