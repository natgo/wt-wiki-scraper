It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 \"New E.R.A.\"]].\n\nThe F4U-4 is excellent at Boom & Zoom fighting. Its high energy-retention and acceleration make it the true pinnacle of the Corsairs. Although you don't get an air spawn, the climb rate of the F4U-4 makes up for that. When engaging an enemy, you should try and maintain an altitude advantage while keeping your speed up; speed is life, altitude is life insurance. Once you gain an altitude advantage, dive on your opponent and fire. Your engine lacks fuel injection, so experiencing negative G forces is likely to temporarily shut down your engine. The six .50 calibre (12.7 mm) machine guns, while not as destructive as the quadruple 20 mm cannons of the F4U-4B or the eight .50 calibre (12.7 mm) machine guns on the P-47, will destroy any lighter aircraft with ease, with plenty of ammunition that allows spraying and still being dangerous in the later stages of the match.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nBeing true for the entire Corsair series the most distinctive features of this plane is its huge R-2800-P&W 18 Cylinder Radial engine and its inverted gull wing.\n\nOne Advantage of the Inverted gull wing;\n\n:The Wing is impossible to rip in a dive as long as you don't pull a turn greater than 25 G's, which is almost impossible because the aircraft does suffer from compression above 800 kph.\n\nOne disadvantage of the aircraft is its high-speed dive characteristics;\n\n:During the dive the aircraft tends to yaw severely to the right making you roll, possibly making the shot you need miss.\n\nThe worst enemies for the F4U are the Ki-84, N1K1, A7M's, and some late mark Zeros. Their extreme turning ability would make any of the F4U-4's attempt at turn fighting worthless. In the worst case scenario when these aircraft managed to get an energy advantage over the F4U-4, escape from the encounter with a dive and try to lose the aircraft through the assistance of allied anti-air fire from friendlies or the airfield.\n\nIn Simulator battles, the F4U-4 is exceptionally good at dogfighting due to its forgiving flight characteristics and excellent visibility. The six M2 Brownings are also easy to aim and can be sprayed for quite some time. Due to its stable nature you can out-turn pretty much any opposing aircraft if it comes to it, though boom and zoom tactics are what you should be sticking to. Enemies especially worth noting are most Soviet and Japanese fighters. Soviet fighters can keep up with you in a dogfight quite well and the Japanese' turn rate is something to watch out for. On the other hand, however, both Soviet and Japanese fighters get set on fire quite easily, and once you get a good burst in, you have (in most cases) secured the kill.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Once it reaches max speed, only Yak-3 (VK-107), Yak-3U, La-9, and Do 335 B-2, can catch it at sea level. This means diving away and extending is a reliable escape tactic.\n* Respectable armament of six .50 Cal machine guns with late war belts\n* Powerful engine, which allows for excellent energy retention\n* Decent secondary weapons for destroying ground targets\n* Excellent roll rate and good elevator authority at all speeds\n* While turnfighting is almost never \"plan A\" in this plane, turn performance is quite good above 400kph.\n* Longer WEP duration than previous corsairs (approximately 12 minutes total)\n* Landing gear can be deployed at most speeds without breaking, which is immensely helpful when attempting to land at higher speeds (often necessary when damaged)\n* Improved flight performance in all aspects over F4U-1s.\n\n'''Cons'''\n\n* Armament insufficient for high-speed snapshots, require more time on target than planes with cannons.\n* Engine prone to overheating after prolonged usage of WEP (RB), though this can be mitigated with manual engine control\n* Turn-fighting heavy aircraft at low speeds is not advised, as the engine isn't strong enough to compensate for the speed lost in prolonged turnfights\n* Rudder becomes less responsive in high speed dives\n* Supercharger setup leaves the plane weakest between 1000-2000 meters and 6000-7000 meters — at these altitudes, the previous supercharger gear is no longer able to maintain manifold pressure (plane begins to lose power and WEP does not increase power), yet the power draw from the engine to run the next supercharger gear is too much to make it worthwhile to switch until more altitude is gained.\n* Bleeds speed very quickly in vertical manoeuvres.\n* Supercharger setup allows for plane to be fast at high altitudes, but limited power-to-weight ratio on 3rd gear makes climbing or accelerating difficult above 7,500 m; this forces pilots to spend more time extending away from enemy planes before re-engaging.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

In order to improve and modernize the Corsair, so it would be able to fight the new Japanese planes in the Pacific, a number of changes were made. One of the major changes was the engine. The Pratt and Whitney R-2800-8W engine was replaced by the more powerful R-2800-18W engine. This -18W engine boosted the speed of the Corsair by up to 46.3 kph (25 kn, 28.76 mph). When injected with an alcohol/water mixture, the performance could be boosted even further. In order for the propeller to be able to handle the more powerful engine, the propeller had to be changed from 3 blades to 4 blades. Modifications to the fuselage were required, including the addition of a scoop to the lower engine cowling. In addition, the cockpit was completely redesigned.\n\nThe armament of the -4 corsair was six .50 in machine guns, up to 4,000 lbs of bombs and/or eight 5 in rockets. There were multiple variants of the F4U-4. There was the F4U-4B, which had only slight modifications for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy. They were never actually delivered to the Royal Navy, as the US kept them instead.The F4U-4C was another variant, which had four 20 mm cannons instead of six .50 in machine guns. There were also two night fighter variants, the F4U-4E and the F4U-4N. The -4E had an APS-4 search radar on the starboard wing tip, while the -4N had an APS-6 search radar instead. Both night fighter versions replaced the six .50 in machine guns with four 20 mm cannons. There was also F4U-4K, an experimental drone variant, and the F4U-4P, a photo reconnaissance variant.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f4u-4 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|LW_BVvR7CIg|'''The Shooting Range #122''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:50 discusses the fate of the F4U Corsair after WW2.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[F4U (Family)|F4U Family]]\n* [[F4U-4B]]\n* [[F4U-1A]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4960-development-f4u-corsair-sky-pirates-are-back-en|[Devblog] F4U Corsair: Sky pirates are back!]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/378367-f4u-4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n* \"[https://www.jdsf4u.be/f4u-4-vought-corsair F4U-4 Vought Corsair]\", ''F4U Corsair - The Bent Wing Bird plane site'', Retrieved on 28 March 2020.\n* \"[https://www.jdsf4u.be/type-of-plane-f4u Types of Plane F4U - Variants]\", ''F4U Corsair- The Bent Wing Bird plane site'', Retrieved on 28 March 2020.\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vought}}\n{{USA fighters}}"}}
