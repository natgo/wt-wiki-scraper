In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American naval fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 \"New E.R.A.\"]].\n\nThe F4U-4B is similar to the [[F4U-4]] which precedes it, mainly in handling, but the main difference and the reason why it sits at a higher BR is the vastly more powerful armament of 4 x 20 mm AN/M3 cannons and an up-rated engine, giving it much more flexibility in its playstyle.\n\nWhile it retains the standard Corsair traits of excellent performance in the horizontal, namely speed, energy retention, and instantaneous turn, its improved engine allows some fighting to be done in the vertical. This is to an extent of course and you don't want to try and out vertical a Griffon Spitfire or a Bf 109 K-4 unless you absolutely know what you're doing, but you can easily stall out planes like Fw 190 As which don't excel in the vertical. This is also aided by the flaps which are very good; the takeoff and landing flaps lower the stall speed immensely but rip easily above 250 km/h (155 mph) IAS, and the combat flaps boosting the turning significantly and can be used up to about 450 km/h (279 mph) IAS. Even without flaps, F4U-4B is an impressive turner despite its weight and can turn with many planes at high speeds (above ~500 km/h/~300 mph), at least enough to get a shot off. With flaps it can turn with a surprising number of planes at low speeds, although as before this is to an extent. Also, be wary of the rudder which rapidly loses effectiveness above 550 km/h (340 mph) and makes shots difficult against evading enemies, although this is alleviated a bit by the powerful armament and fairly good roll rate.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Even very short bursts can be lethal against aircraft. Belts with AP-T shells are quite good against ground targets, even the Air Targets belts can make short work of medium tanks in air battles.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe F4U-4B should be flown primarily at low altitude because its engine lacks power at higher altitudes. Here, it boasts an impressive climb rate (about 25 m/s when spaded), very good acceleration, and a high top speed. You should aim to be around 3-4km at the start of the battle and go after low enemies using boom and zoom tactics, then use your speed to outrun anyone who dives on you. You can then use your engine power and energy retention to gain an energy advantage over them and easily kill them. If you find yourself in a tough situation, don't be afraid to go a bit aggressive because this plane accelerates very well at low altitude and the extremely powerful guns makes it easy to secure kills quickly, but don't stall yourself out at the deck amidst a cloud of enemies since you'll be an easy kill.\n\n====Specific enemies worth noting====\n<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->\nThis plane can easily dogfight with Fw 190 Ds/152s, Tempest Mk Vs, Sea Furies, and similar planes, can dogfight with difficulty with Bf 109s and similar, and should avoid dogfighting unless as an absolute last resort against Spitfires, Ki-84s, A7Ms, N1Ks, and similar. Fortunately, the F4U-4B is usually faster than most planes it can't dogfight. It's far faster than most Japanese and Italian props and all Spitfires up to the Mk 22 at low altitude. In an up-tier against superprops like Tempest IIs, Spitfire Mk 24s, and P-51Hs and F8Fs if you get a mixed battle, you have to rely on coming in with an advantage as with any other plane in an uptier, though this is made easier with the F4U-4B's excellent top speed.\n\nThe F4U-4B is devastating in the right hands, and is one of the best planes the US tech tree has to offer.\n\n====Counter-tactics====\n<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->\nYou're best off engaging the F4U-4B at higher altitudes where its performance suffers. You can also try bleeding their energy in hard vertical manoeuvres where it struggles, but be careful while doing this especially at low altitude since a potential opponent can still use the Corsair's stall characteristics combined with its engine power to get a shot off, which can be devastating no matter how short a burst.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The F4U-4 was based on the F4U-1A Corsair. In order to improve and modernize the Corsair, so it would be able to fight the new Japanese planes in the Pacific, a number of changes were made. One of the major changes was the engine. The Pratt and Whitney R-2800-8W engine was replaced by the more powerful R-2800-18W engine. This -18W engine boosted the speed of the Corsair by up to 46.3 km/h (25 kn, 28.76 mph). When injected with an alcohol/water mixture, the performance could be boosted even further. In order for the propeller to be able to handle the more powerful engine, the propeller had to be changed from 3 blades to 4 blades. Modifications to the fuselage were required, including the addition of a scoop to the lower engine cowling. In addition, the cockpit was completely redesigned. The F4U-4 was armed with six .50 in machine guns, up to 4,000 lbs of bombs and/or eight 5 in rockets.\n\nA variant was to be created for the British Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy. It was called the F4U-4C, but none were delivered to the Fleet Air Arm, for whatever reason. The F4U-4C was then redesignated the F4U-4B. The only major difference between the F4U-4 and the F4U-4B was a change of primary armament. The -4B replaced the six .50 in machine guns with four 20 mm cannons. The F4U-4B was used by the US Navy and Marine Corps. Notably, they were used by VMF-214 (Marine Fighter Squadron 214) of the Marine Corps, nicknamed \"Blacksheep\". VMF-214 flew F4U-4B strikes off USS ''Sicily'' (CVE-118) between August and November 1950 during the Korean War.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f4u-4b Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|LW_BVvR7CIg|'''The Shooting Range #122''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:50 discusses the fate of the F4U Corsair after WW2.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[F4U (Family)|F4U Family]]\n** [[F4U-1A]]\n** [[F4U-4]]\n** [[F4U-4B VMF-214]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4960-development-f4u-corsair-sky-pirates-are-back-en|[Devblog] F4U Corsair: Sky pirates are back!]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/378370-f4u-4b/ [Forum<nowiki>]</nowiki> Vought F4U-4B Corsair - Aircraft Data Sheets]\n\n=== References ===\n\n;Bibliography\n* \"[https://www.jdsf4u.be/f4u-4b-vought-corsair F4U-4B Vought Corsair]\", ''F4U Corsair - The Bent Wing Bird plane site'', Retrieved on 28 March 2020.\n* \"[https://www.jdsf4u.be/type-of-plane-f4u Types of Plane F4U - Variants]\", ''F4U Corsair- The Bent Wing Bird plane site'', Retrieved on 28 March 2020.\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vought}}\n{{USA fighters}}"}}
