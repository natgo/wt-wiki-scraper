Use this aircraft as a boom and zoomer.\n* Play it as an attacker, use the famous 114 x SNEB rocket payload. This payload is the best for the Enduring Confrontation. There is enough firepower to eliminate all the enemies on the battlefield with careful aim. And a convoy is just a piece of cake. For the tanks, send six rockets, two for howitzer and two to four rockets for a pillbox. When you run out of rockets, you have two choices:\n*# Return to the airfield to reload\n*# Use it as a fighter, but you'll be turning 2.7s slower, select those fighters which have a poorer turning radius.\n* Fly the aircraft as a fighter/bomber, take the payload with the 3 x 1,000 lbs bombs and attack the bases. Once you're out of bombs, you can dogfight other planes.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The U.S. decided to help France by making the F4U-7. The F4U-7 was essentially the AU-1 Corsair and F4U-4 Corsair mixed together. It combined the engine from the F4U-4 and airframe, but it also had the payload capacity of the AU-1 Corsair. This allowed it to be powerful against fighters but also effective against ground targets. The U.S. actually bought the F4U-7s first, then through MAP (Military Assistance Program), France received them.\n\nIn 1956, due to the inaccuracy of free-fall bombs and unguided rockets, France experimented with the F4U-7 in its ability to carry [[SS-11]] guided missiles. France couldn't afford sortie after sortie with a shortage of pilots, so the only way to combat that was to make weapons more accurate. Use of the SS.11 on the F4U-7 required intense training as there would be 2 sticks, one to fly the plane and one to guide the missile to its target. This required the pilot to have \"2 brains\" as you would have to fly while watching the ATGM. France found it to be a success, so they decided to select a squadron to start the process on, but however, they decided to not pursue it. France couldn't take 15 Corsairs at a time to be fitted with ATGMs due to their small fleet of only around 115 F4U-7s. However, the idea did live on with the MD.311 Flamant.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f4u-7 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|LW_BVvR7CIg|'''The Shooting Range #122''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:50 discusses the fate of the F4U Corsair after WW2.|VHJN6ZWOmnY|'''The bane of tanks''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:11 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5502-development-f4u-7-the-corsair-under-a-french-tricolore-en|[Devblog] F4U-7: The Corsair under a French Tricolore]]\n* [https://wwiiafterwwii.wordpress.com/2017/04/14/guided-missiles-on-corsairs/ <nowiki>[wwiiafterwwii.wordpress.com]</nowiki> Guided missiles on Corsairs]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vought}}\n{{France fighters}}"}}
