Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIn Arcade battles the F8F-1B can perform at its prime, which is, accordingly, remarkably. Due to the lack of damage due to overheating and such, the F8F-1B can easily outstrip any piston-engined fighter in a climb once upgraded. Prior to the engine-injection upgrade, the 1B performs very well, but not as sublimely as it does with the latter modification. Thus, climbing and BnZ match perfectly with the F8F-1B in AB due to its astounding climb rate, speed, acceleration, and weaponry.\n\nRegarding weaponry, fire in very short bursts with the M3 20mm because they will jam rather quickly. The most ideal belt is Air Targets, as the belt has - together with the stealth belt, but the Air Targets belt has instead of a practice shell an API-T shell - the most HEF-I shells.\n\nIn RB, the F8F-1B is a monster. It possesses a fantastic climb rate, roll rate, high-capacity armament, and flight performance. Top speed and level speed are top notch in this aircraft, as is the dive-speed tolerance (~800 kph). Unfortunately, this power comes at a great price. Called the \"Ovencat\" by some players, the F8F-1B's engine will overheat in less than a minute while utilizing WEP. It is not recommended for any pilot to use WEP UNTIL unlocking the \"Radiator\" modification!. Therefore, always side-climb at the beginning of a match as the 1B needs all the energy it can get, especially when facing opponents such as the FW-190 D which can out-climb an F8F-1B in continuous climb due to the lower thermal restraints of its Junkers engine.\n\nThe F8F-1B suffers at altitudes over 6,500 m. Below that, of course, utilize Boom & Zoom as your main tactic. Acceleration is magnificent as is dive speed. You will find it rather difficult to rip your wings in a dive. Careful not to push the Bearcat too far, though, as rolling manoeuvres and fast-paced moves can easily rip its wings.\n\nThe M3 20 mm cannons have an extremely fast fire rate and thus may drain your ammunition storage rather quickly. However, the massive 826 round storage should be plenty for quite a lot of battling in the skies!\n\nThe F8F-1B can also be used as an effective fighter-bomber. It can carry a large payload of Tiny Tims, bombs, and assorted rockets, making it an effective attacker.\n\nTurning is not recommended in RB due to the 1B's mediocre turn rate.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== Development ===\nThe concept of the G-58 (the Grumman designation for what would become the F8F Bearcat) began on 23 June, 1942. The Vice President of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation Jake Swirbul met with F4F Wildcat pilots that had fought in the Battle of Midway. Jimmie Thatch - one of the pilots - emphasized the fact that climb rate is one of the most important characteristics of a good plane.\n\nClimb rate is linked to power-to-weight ratio, so to increase climb rate a powerful engine and small, lightweight airframe are necessary. Not only would the G-58 have to have a good climb rate, but it also needed to be able to operate from escort carriers, which the F6F Hellcat was too large to operate from, and as such only the obsolete F4F Wildcat could operate from the escort carriers. A small, light aircraft could accomplish both goals; it could operate from the escort carriers and it could have a good climb rate. Grumman began developing the G-58 Bearcat in late 1943, after studying carrier warfare in the Pacific for a year and a half.\n\nIt is thought by some that the FW-190 influenced the design of the G-58, but it has never been confirmed, and it's still up for debate. The Grumman test pilots flew and examined a captured FW-190 in 1943 in England, and the G-58 also has a number of features very similar to the FW-190 such as the landing gear and cowling arrangements, but there is no hard evidence that the data from the testing of the FW-190 was used to develop the G-58.\n\n=== F8F-1B ===\nThe F8F-1B was an improvement over the F8F-1 Bearcat. The armament of the F8F-1 (four 12.7 mm machine guns) was changed to four 20 mm cannons on the F8F-1B. That was the only major difference between the two models.\n\n=== Service ===\nThe First Indochina War of 1946-1954 was the conflict which would first test the Bearcat in combat. In 1951, 200 Bearcats were delivered to France, and the French Bearcats were used extensively during the First Indochina War.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f8f1b_france Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|4v3fxupuZPA|'''Last piston fighters''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 5:28 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|PNkoJ-MFERc|'''Best naval fighters''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:24 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|ceCcHSoUiLE|'''French F8F-1B [Jet Killer!]''' - ''Jengar''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[F8F (Family)]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[F6F (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/F8F/F8F-1_Standard_Aircraft_Characteristics.pdf Standard Aircraft Characteristics of the F8F-1]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Grumman}}\n{{France fighters}}"}}
