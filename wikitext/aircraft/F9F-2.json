It was introduced in [[Update 1.37]].\n\nThe Panther will typically find itself outclassed as it often faces against more advanced jet designs, such as the [[MiG-15]] or [[Venom FB.4|Venom]]. However, it does excel in a support fighter role. Distracted opponents are easy prey when the Panther's high-speed driving and manoeuvrability are applied correctly. When engaged 1 on 1 with other jet fighters, its flaws (low top speed) can be exposed. Defensively, the Panther has an uncanny ability to escape pursuing enemies when using its agility to your advantage. The Panther greatly excels at the Fighter-bomber role due to its optional payloads.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

It is often outclassed by more powerful enemies such as the [[MiG-15]], but as a support to allies, it shines nonetheless. In this play-style, the Panther can leverage its desirable dive characteristics to prey on distracted opponents. A Panther pilot may often find themselves with an enemy on their six. In such a defensive situation, the F9F-2 provides an excellent roll rate with which to dodge enemy fire. However, to dispatch the opponent, it is often necessary to employ the help of teammates.\n\nThe Panther has a wide selection of ground-attack ordnance options and can use either bombs or rockets to destroy ground targets very effectively in ground realistic battles. In air battles, the Panther is in almost all cases better suited for an air-to-air role, but even when ordnance is not mounted, the internal 20 mm cannons are able to destroy lightly armoured ground targets. When using HVAR rockets, the aim is especially important, as the six rockets are fired in pairs. With only three shots, it is important to maximize the rockets' effectiveness by aiming slightly to the side of the target. Since the rockets are wing-mounted, this will result in one of them hitting the target directly and causing the maximum possible damage.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The United States Navy commissioned a jet-powered fighter for its carrier decks. Grumman began work on the XF9F-1 Prototype (Grumman designation G75). The airframe would carry two crewmen and implement four turbojet engines. At the time, four of them were planned to be used due to the low power output by early turbojet engines. This ran into several issues including taking up too much space on American carriers. Eventually, the design was dropped in favour of the XF9F-2 prototype, Grumman's Model G79, that utilized 1 crew member and eventually a single-engine. The British Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine was used for basic testing. Pratt & Whitney were eventually able to produce the engine and it was designated \"J42\". As the Panther moved along the creation process, items like wingtip fuel tanks were added to increase its range. Carrier trials with the prototypes were completed in March of 1949. The F9F-2 entered US Navy service in May of 1949.\n\nThe F9F-2 is the first production variant of the Panther. It is powered by a Pratt & Whitney J42-P-8, a license-built version of the Rolls Royce Nene engine. The F9F-2B was a new variant of the F9F-2 which allowed it to carry 2,000 lbs of ordnance under its wings. Once all F9F-2s were upgraded to the B standard, the B designation was dropped and the aircraft was simply referred to as F9F-2.\n\nThe Panther entered combat during the Korean War. It was the primary jet fighter used by the U.S. Navy and Marines. It played a significant part in the ground attack role and flew over 78,000 sorties. It secured the first U.S. Naval air to air kill against a Yak-9. Famous F9F pilots included astronaut John Glenn and Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams. Panthers were pulled from front-line service in 1956 in favour of the swept-wing \"Cougar\". F9F Panther was the first jet used with the US Navy's Blue Angels aerobatic team.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f9f-2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[F9F-5]]\n* [[F9F-8]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/272059-grumman-f9f-2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Grumman}}\n{{USA jet aircraft}}"}}
