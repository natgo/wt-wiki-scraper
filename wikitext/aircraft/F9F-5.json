If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Arcade Battles\n\nThe baseline Panther has very poor performance, losing a lot of speed in turns and having poor acceleration. Once the aircraft has been upgraded, it is a very powerful fighter. Its decent climb rate and 20mm guns make the aircraft best for Boom and Zoom tactics. The aircraft has poor top speed, making it vulnerable to enemy F-86s and MiGs flying at higher altitudes.\n\n;Realistic and Simulator Battles\n\nThe Panther will typically find itself outclassed. However, it does excel in a support fighter role. Distracted opponents are easy prey when the Panther's high-speed diving and manoeuvrability are applied correctly. When engaged 1 on 1 with other jet fighters, its flaws (low top speed) can be exposed. Defensively, the Panther has an uncanny ability to escape pursuing enemies when using its agility to your advantage. The Panther greatly excels at the Fighter-bomber role due to its optional payloads.\n\n===Radars===\n<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->\nThe F9F-5 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\nIt will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target.

The United States Navy commissioned a jet-powered fighter for its carrier decks. Grumman began work on the XF9F-1 Prototype. The airframe would carry two crewmen and implement four turbojet engines. At the time four of them were planned to be used due to the low power output by early turbojet engines. This ran into several issues including taking up too much space on American carriers. Eventually, the design was dropped in favour of the XF9F-2 prototype that utilized 1 crew member and eventually a single-engine. The British Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine was used for basic testing. Pratt & Whitney were eventually able to produce the engine and it was designated \"J42\". As the Panther moved along the creation process, items like wingtip fuel tanks were added to increase its range. Carrier trials with the prototypes were completed in March of 1949. The F9F-2 entered US Navy service in May of 1949.\n\nThe Panther entered combat during the Korean War. It was the primary jet fighter used by the U.S. Navy and Marines. It played a significant part in the ground attack role and flew over 78,000 sorties. It secured the first U.S. Naval air to air kill against a Yak-9. Famous F9F pilots included astronaut John Glenn and Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams. Panthers were pulled from front-line service in 1956 in favour of the swept-wing \"Cougar\". F9F Panther was the first jet used with the US Navy's Blue Angels aerobatic team.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe F9F Panther was a fighter-bomber developed by the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation and used during the Korean War by the US Navy and USMC. It was also the first aircraft used by the Navy's Blue Angels aerial demonstration team.\n\nThe project started after World War II when Grumman proposed the XF9F-1 experimental aircraft (Grumman designation G75), a two-seat, four-engined aircraft for a contract to build a jet-powered night fighter for the US Navy. The company lost to the Douglas XF3D-1, but received funding to continue development of the XF9F. After jet technologies evolved to create engines with higher thrust, Grumman designed the Model G79, a single-engined day fighter. When the Navy realized the potential of this new design, they shifted funding towards the G79, which became the F9F Panther. Permanent fuel tanks were added to the wingtips to extend the range of the thirsty jet, but the added weight incidentally improved the aircraft's roll rate.\n\nThe F9F-5 is the last and most produced variant of the Panther. It is a further development of the F9F-4, which lengthened the fuselage to carry more fuel. The F9F-5 was re-engined with the Pratt & Whitney J48 engine, a license-built version of the Rolls-Royce Tay engine. The Panther was later developed into the F9 Cougar, a swept-wing aircraft with significantly more thrust.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f9f-5 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[F9F-2]]\n* [[F9F-8]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/272060-grumman-f9f-5/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Grumman}}\n{{USA jet aircraft}}"}}
