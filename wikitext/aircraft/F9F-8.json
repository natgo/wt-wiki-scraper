It was introduced in [[Update 1.63 \"Desert Hunters\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe F9F Cougar is a further improvement of the F9F series with the main changes that are changed wings, now being swept and a new more powerful engine, the Pratt & Whitney J48-P-8A. It increased the level speed to 1041 km/h and when the plane carries four AIM-9B missiles it is 991 km/h at sea level, which is still slower than a MiG-15 or F-86. Its speed limit is also higher: 1127 km/h IAS. The level acceleration is almost the same compared to previous versions, but since it is faster it gets better above 850 km/h.\nThe other aspect that has been slightly improved over the F9F-5 is climb rate, now can reach 29 m/s at sea level with full fuel tanks and increases to ~38 m/s with 20 minutes of fuel, it will not be able to out climb most of jet fighters from other nations at similar battle rating.\nFlying at full power is limited to 30 minutes of operation until the engine overheats and can fly at 95% of power indefinitely.\n\nThe Cougar wings' shape was changed a lot, the wing area was also increased. Due to lowered wing loading its low and medium speed turn rate was improved with the exception of stall speed which is higher, 217 km/h IAS with landing flaps.\nThe swept wings also increased the manoeuvrability at high speed, but the Cougar can lock up badly near transonic speeds, although it can use the airbrake to slow down to the speed where it retains the best turn rate, which is between 600 and 800 km/h IAS. The flaps cannot be used to improve dogfight capabilities, only one position for landing is available which use is limited to 410 km/h IAS.\nIts roll rate up to 600 km/h IAS is almost the same, can reach up to ~100 degrees per second, but above its new wings allow the Cougar to improve it to ~150 degrees per second at 900 km/h.\nOne thing that did not change are very low G limits, they can be easily exceeded after reaching 9-10G above 600 km/h IAS.\n\nWith full real controls the plane can break its wings even easier than with enabled instructor, it is recommended to not install the New Boosters module.\nOverall the plane has very good flight characteristics, especially at higher speed where it has good turning energy retention, even during pulling 5-6G.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 610 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

The F9F-8 default cannons get jammed in a quick burst.\n\nThis said don't expect to dogfight very well against any pure fighter jet as the turn time is quite stock but when you spade it outturning does get a better but the F9F-8 performs great defensive manoeuvres and can keep up in turns with the MiGs (beware that doesn't have the great acceleration that MiGs have).\n\nThis is not an air superiority aircraft, its main purpose is to support ground vehicles and planes.\n\nThe best tactics if you are new to this plane is to fly it like a F9F-2 or F9F-5 so stay near some allies and give them support.\n\n* Never roll too hard over 750 km/h (466 mph) or the wings will explode\n* Never execute manoeuvres over –2 G or the wings will explode\n\n===Radars===\n<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->\nThe F9F-8 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\nIt will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target.

The resulting ''Cougar'' was a very new design in many ways bucking post-war design trends. The fuselage, fin and rudder remained the same, however, the wings were completely new with a 35-degree sweep and lacking the distinctive wingtip tanks of the Panther. The engine was also an upgrade, a Pratt and Whitney J48 with an extra 1,000 kg of thrust over the previous J42. First flight was 20 September 1951, with operational trials starting three months later. Squadron deliveries began in November 1952. 706 F9F-6s with the original engine were produced, and 168 of the F9F-7 which used the Allison J33 turbojet instead.\n\nThe F9F-8 was the final version. Its prototype's first flight was December 1953. In this model, the fuselage was lengthened 30 cm to increase the space for fuel tanks. It had the J48-P-8 engines installed that gave it a total of 3,447kg of Thrust, the wings were also modified slightly to add an in-air refuelling probe plus the capability of mounting four Aim-9 sidewinders and a nose radar was fitted. In total, 601 F9F-8s were built.\n\nThe F9F-8 was too late to see combat in Korea, however, there were four trainer versions of the F9F-8 (F9F-8T) deployed to Vietnam and was used in airstrike directing for incoming allied aircraft.\n\nThe Argentine Navy was the only other nation to operate the F9F-8 and was the first jet aircraft that they ever had capable of breaking the sound barrier (In a dive).\n\nIt is also worth noting that the F9F-8 was redesignated, as part of the United States Tri-Service Designation System, to the F-9J in 1962.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=f9f-8 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n{{Skin-gallery|market|ugcitem_1000237|F9F-8 Lynx.png|Camo \"Lynx\"}}\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nF9F-8 left-hand banking turn (In-Game).jpg\nF9F-8 Sidewinder.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|pEC-vTUmio4|'''This Plane Used To Be Terrible''' - ''Spit_flyer''|WdnBY3NcWiE|'''Why you should grind to F9F Cougar (Jet Gameplay)''' - ''PhlyDaily''|iQ97c_m8G0I|'''The Shooting Range #16''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:05 discusses the F9F-8.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;[[F9F (Family)|Related development]]\n\n* [[F9F-2]]\n* [[F9F-5]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4239-development-f9f-8-cougar-a-perfect-predator-en/|[Devblog] F9F-8 Cougar - A Perfect Predator]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/330721-f9f-8/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Grumman}}\n{{USA jet aircraft}}"}}
