In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Ixwa Strike\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Fokker D.XXI is a fairly pleasurable aircraft to play. Its manoeuvrability is quite good, being able to outturn a lot of aircraft of this BR. Also, its climb rate is great for its BR. However, keep in mind that it it rather slow,  and might not be able to keep up with other fighters. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is highly agile for its class. This allows it to comfortably defend itself against most opponents, that will often struggle to get a good shot. The downside to its maoeuvrability is its speed. The {{PAGENAME}} is quite primitive, with a lot of drag coming from both the landing gear and wing-mounted cannons. This makes the {{PAGENAME}} unable to run away from most opponents, as even some biplanes are capable of catching up. This doesn't mean the plane is weak however, as the engine provides well over 700 horsepower to this light machine, allowing it to climb high above most targets.\n\nThe strategy when using the {{PAGENAME}} should be to make the plane as light as possible, while using the engine to gain a height advantage. This can be achieved by taking the minimum amount of fuel, and putting the plane to a ~15° climb at take-off. This ensures that the plane will be the lightest aircraft at altitude, making any dogfight at height favorable, as most planes capable of reaching this height are much more cumbersome in comparison. Once the opponents up high have been cleared, the {{PAGENAME}} is able to make use of the altitude to boom & zoom opponents below with ease, as the plane can safely dive without damaging itself.\n\n{{Notice|Pilots more comfortable with dogfighting can utilize the Landing flaps when stalling, to quickly flip back over. This allows for some advanced tactics against slower opponents.}}\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

In 1935, the Dutch Air Force ordered the construction of a prototype which would be evaluated by its East Indies branch, as a result of the aircraft being seen as suitable for defending Dutch overseas assets.\n\nAlthough its maiden flight in 1936 showed enough promise, the fate of the Fokker D.XXI was \"hanging in the air\" for a time due to a change in doctrine within the Dutch Air Force. As a result, Fokker began looking into promoting the aircraft on the export market, hoping to find foreign customers.\n\nFortunately, Fokker received interest from both Denmark and Finland to purchase a number of aircraft as well as rights to production. At the same time, domestic interest was also revived, resulting in the start of production in 1937.\n\nDespite being a Dutch design, the Fokker D.XXI was predominantly produced and employed by Finland. Having built and operated around ⅔ of all D.XXIs, the Finnish Fokkers distinguished themselves during the Winter and Continuation War, although with less success in the latter due to their dated design. The Dutch Fokkers also put up a stiff resistance to the invading German forces in May 1940, shooting down a number of enemy aircraft, including several superior Messerschmitt Bf 109s. In the end, approximately 150 D.XXIs were built, serving up until 1949 with Finnish forces.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fokker_d21_mod20 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Finnish Fokker D.XXI WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:Finnish Fokker D.XXI WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:Finnish Fokker D.XXI WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:Finnish Fokker D.XXI WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:Finnish Fokker D.XXI WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:Finnish Fokker D.XXI WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n'''Similar Swedish aircraft'''\n\n* [[Mörkö-Morane]]\n* [[J11]]\n* [[J20]]\n\n'''Comparable aircraft'''\n\n* [[Ki-27 otsu]]\n* [[Yak-1]]\n* [[I-16 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7045-development-fokker-d-xxi-the-flying-dutchman-en|[Devblog] Fokker D.XXI: The Flying Dutchman]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/518099-fokker-dxxi/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Fokker}}\n{{Sweden fighters}}\n{{Sweden premium aircraft}}"}}
