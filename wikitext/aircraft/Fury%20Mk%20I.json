Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\t\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a reserve rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe Fury Mk I is one of the three reserve fighters in the British tree - the other two being the [[Nimrod Mk I]], as well as the [[Fury Mk II]]. \n\n[[File:Fury Mk1 an trn 26 001.png|350px|thumb|left|The {{PAGENAME}} tumbling in a dogfight with a He 51 B-1.]]\n\nThe first {{PAGENAME}} prototype was presented in 1927, with the first flight of a production model in March 1931 and entered service with the RAF in May of the same year, together with the [[Nimrod Mk I]] (a naval version of the Fury). The {{PAGENAME}} was in service with Yugoslavia, Iran, South Africa, as well as participated in the Spanish Civil War and World War II. \n\nIn the game, the {{PAGENAME}} is a slow fighter with insufficient weapons and not the best rate of climb, but with quite great maneuverability. The turning speed is better than most other biplanes, which gives it an advantage, but during active maneuvers, the speed is used up very quickly. Thus, after one full circle, it is impossible to stay at the same height, it is necessary to descend to maintain controllability of the aircraft. \n\nA total of 117 {{PAGENAME}} fighters were produced. In 1937 the [[Fury Mk II]] was introduced with a more powerful engine. It replaced the {{PAGENAME}} in production and on airfields. \n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nAs a reserve plane, the Fury isn't a fast plane. It can't climb nor accelerate very well, but all the Fury variants can turn decently, though they tend to bleed energy easily. The modelled fixed pitch prop will mean not much power is around for climbing at the start of the match - a problem also currently shared with the later Gladiators.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,100 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems. -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} was an aircraft that was stripped of all which was unnecessary to enable it to be the lightest and fastest possible. Like many biplanes just before the start of World War II, the only protection afforded the pilot was the wood and canvas around him and the engine at the front of the aircraft. The best course of protection for this aircraft is to gain the element of surprise as it will not take much to damage critical components or knock out the pilot. All critical modules are concentrated in the forward fuselage area so attacks from the front or the side tend to do the most damage quickly.\n\n* No armour protection\n* Largely wood and canvas construction\n* Self-sealing fuel tanks\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

This means the Fury can take a while (and a bit of ammo) to destroy targets it will face at its rank such as [[Bf 109 B-1/L|Bf 109 B-1]]s, [[CR.42]]s, [[I-15 WR|I-15s]] and even lightly armoured [[Ki-27 otsu|Ki-27s]] and [[A5M4|A5Ms]]. Keep in mind that unlike the current modelled Brownings as used on [[Gladiator Mk II|Gladiators]], these 7.7 mm guns won't do much damage unless you aim for the most vulnerable parts of your opponent's aircraft.\n\nUse Universal or Stealth rounds with the Vickers K machine guns, but keep in mind that these 7.7 mm guns won't do much damage unless you aim for the most vulnerable parts of opposing aircraft.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:Fury Mk1 an trn 26 002.png|400px|thumb|right|A {{PAGENAME}} watching a He 51 B-1 go down in flames]]\nIf you want to use the Fury, the best advice is to side climb a bit at the start of the match so you at least have some energy to work with. Plan manoeuvres ahead and go for easy targets such as inattentive planes and attackers destroying ground vehicles. Most of the problems with the plane are mitigated in Arcade Battles as traits like engine overheating and wing rip-offs are not modelled in that mode.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is a typical reserve aircraft in that it is an unremarkable plane. It is neither outstanding in speed, its manoeuvrability or even weapons loadout. Though contemporary aircraft may have a speed advantage, beefier weapons or even more manoeuvrability, the {{PAGENAME}} can still find its place on the battlefield in both in air battles and the ground attack game.\n\n;Ground Attack\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has a crazy low stall-speed which allows it to circle anti-aircraft artillery or anti-aircraft vehicles easily. Though the plane's Vickers 7.7 mm machine guns are relatively weak, they can wreak havoc on the ground targets if enough bullets connect with their targets. If there are no enemy aircraft circling above the Mk I, then it can leisurely eliminate the ground targets, even tightly grouped vehicles. Even without access to bombs, the {{PAGENAME}} can be an effective ground attacker.\n\n;Air-to-air Attack\n\n[[File:Fury Mk1 an trn 26 003.png|400px|thumb|right|A {{PAGENAME}} moving on to hit next target]]\nWith many contemporary aircraft using faster firing machine guns, larger calibre guns or just more of them, it will take a skilful Fury pilot to balance or tip the scales. With 600 rounds of ammunition for each Vickers machine gun, there is a lot to work with; however, it is to the pilot's detriment to spray bullets everywhere. To make the most impact with the 7.7 mm rounds, the best chances to hit the enemy are when while in close. The longer the shot, the more likely bullets will either miss or harmlessly bounce off the target. Attacking close in between 100 and 300 m gives the best chances in critically damaging the enemy. Unless the pilot pulls off a pilot snipe and knocks out the pilot, chances are it may take a couple passes to inflict enough damage to send the target to the ground in flames. Close in attacks may offer the best opportunities to damage the enemy, but it can make for some hectic flying.\n\nThe 7.7 mm bullets fired at aircraft fuselage do relatively little damage; therefore, it is crucial to target critical components such as the pilot, engines, oil coolers, and fuel tanks to eliminate the enemy effectively. Aircraft wings can also be susceptible to snapping if enough bullets perforate the skin and structure.\n\nOne use for the {{PAGENAME}} is as an early interceptor aircraft against bombers. While [[Do 17 (Family)|Do-17]], [[TBD-1]], [[SB 2M (Family)|SB 2M]], [[Ki-21 (Family)|Ki-21]], and [[F.222.2]] bombers have various defensive gunners, they are not impossible to shoot down with the Fury. The pilot does need to watch how they approach the bombers. Typically flying in from the front or the underside of the bombers allows for an unscathed approach. However, if you find that you must approach with a defensive position firing at you, make small adjustments to stay out of the line of fire and wait for the gunner to run out of ammunition before levelling off and taking a shot. Chances are you can knock out the gunner or even work on taking out the engines. A crippled bomber easily allows the more manoeuvrable biplane to make enough passes to finish the job.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In March 1931, after being renamed into the '''Hawker Fury''', the biplane made its maiden flight and entered service with the RAF in May of the same year. The Fury would serve in not only the Royal Air Force, but also with Yugoslavia, Iran, South Africa, and the Spanish, which they used during the Spanish Civil War. While the {{PAGENAME}} did not become a mainstream RAF fighter, Fury pilots were considered elite due to Fury-equipped squadrons such as No.1 squadron participations in gunnery and aerobatic competitions. A total of 117 {{PAGENAME}} fighters were produced.\n\nIn 1937, the [[Fury Mk II]] was introduced with a more powerful engine. It replaced the {{PAGENAME}} in production and on airfields.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Hawker Fury was a single engine, single-seat biplane of composite structure which first entered service in May 1931. The Fury was designed by H.G. Hawker Engineering Co. Ltd (Hawker Aircraft Ltd since 1933) under the direction of Sidney Camm. The Fury prototype made its first flight in March 1931 and after a successful test and evaluation period, entered production for service in Britain's Royal Air Force. However, the Fury was an expensive aircraft and, with Britain being in the grip of a financial depression, initially only enough aircraft were ordered to equip three squadrons; Nos 1, 25 and 43 Squadrons.\n\nAn elegant aircraft with streamlined fuselage contours, the Fury Mk.I was the first RAF fighter with a speed exceeding 322 km/h (200 mph).\n\nMost aircraft were equipped with a 525 hp liquid-cooled in-line twelve-cylinder Rolls-Royce Kestrel IIS engine and a wooden twin-bladed Watts propeller, although several alternative powerplants became available during the Fury's service life.\n\nThe Fury's fuselage, wings, and tail had a metal framework and a fabric skin. The skin of the forward fuselage up to the cockpit and the engine cowling was made of duralumin sheets. Ailerons were fitted to the upper wing; nevertheless, due to their large area, they were very responsive and provided the aircraft with a high roll rate.\n\nThe armament consisted of two synchronous 0.303 inch Vickers Mk.IV machine guns with 600 rounds per gun, mounted in front of the cockpit. Whilst the Fury was an excellent fighter when it first entered service, it did mark the end of an era as one of the last open cockpit, biplane fighters produced by Britain. Its fixed undercarriage, fabric skin and twin Vickers guns were reminiscent of fighters of the First World War, and when it was replaced in front line service with the RAF in 1939, it truly was a relic of a bygone era.\n\nA total of 117 {{PAGENAME}} fighters were produced, in five series.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fury_mk1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Fury Mk1 an trn 26 005.png\nFile:Fury Mk1 an trn 26 006.png\nFile:Fury Mk1 an trn 26 007.png\nFile:Fury Mk1 an trn 26 008.png\nFile:Fury Mk1 an trn 26 009.png\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|xDiMJA-Sy1c|'''The Hawker Fury Mk.1''' - ''SirKittalot''|iIyGIQs8bSI|'''Hawker Fury Mk I''' - ''Wings''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Fury Mk II]]\n* [[Nimrod Mk I]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Hawker}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
