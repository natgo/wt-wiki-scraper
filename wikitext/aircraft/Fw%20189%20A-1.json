It was introduced during [[Update 1.61 \"Road to Glory\"]] in the \"[[wt:en/news/4151-special-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-updated-03-08-2016-en/|Operation S.U.M.M.E.R.]]\" event of 2016 that lasted from 22 July to 22 August after obtaining 18 pilot Marks of Distinction.

The Fw 189 does however excel when it comes to manoeuvrability, being able to easily out perform most fighters in this regard.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 2,600 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Fortunately the aircraft can be flown like any other turn fighter in-game due to its impressive manoeuvrability which allows it to competitively combat most fighters that it encounters.\n\nThe Fw 189 is best described as a multi-purpose heavy fighter. Thanks to the light airframe, large wingspan and large elevator, the Fw 189 is an incredibly manoeuvrable plane, rivalling that of early rank Spitfires and Hurricanes. Thus, in war thunder, the Fw 189 fulfils the roles of a light bomber, ground attacker, heavy fighter, and reconnaissance in EC/ combined battles. It's extremely adaptive to whatever role you play as (except for bombing bases), a rare trait in War Thunder lower tiers where many aircraft only excel at a single role.\n\nThe Fw 189 can start matches by either engaging enemy bombers thanks to its bomber airspawn, or engaging enemy fighter aircraft which would still be well below you when you reach them allowing for a significant advantage in initial engagements.\n\nIn Ground Battles the Fw 189 can be used to engage enemy ground vehicles using its 7.92 mm MGs and 50 kg bombs, although these armaments are somewhat weak against most tanks even at lower tiers they can often provide means of gaining a few ground vehicle frags before you need to return to base, although being a somewhat large aircraft you should be careful when flying close to enemy ground units or terrain as these could knock the aircraft out if you are not careful.\n\nWhile the Fw 189 can continue to fly after the loss of a single engine it will be severely under powered so a return to base in an 'engine out' situation is advisable.\n\nWhile the pilot controlled 7.92 mm MG 17s of the Fw 189 are somewhat weak when attacking enemy aircraft they do have a good fire rate and a good amount of ammunition (500 rpg), so if your shots can continue to hit an enemy aircraft you will shortly be able to knock out some critical components and down the enemy aircraft.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Two aircraft manufacturers wanted the contract: Arado and Focke-Wulf (Blohm & Voss participated but it was a private venture). The Fw 189 prototype had an unusual twin-boom twin engine design so that there would be no engine blocking the front of the cockpit which offered maximum visibility and good speed. It was powered by two Argus As 410 engines and utilized a heavily glazed \"stepless\" cockpit; an all glass windscreen for the pilot to improve vision, which is similar to cockpits found on most German medium bombers. It was extremely successful not only because it was fast, but also because it was an extremely manoeuvrable aircraft. One trick utilized when a fighter came to intercept it was to start turning in a tight circle, which the pursuing fighter could not match. Later in the war, this aircraft was retrofitted for a variety of tasks which included light ground attack and a night fighter variant.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fw-189a-1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|zn2uhgI2PPg|'''Best twin-boom aircraft''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 02:32 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|frc5okX0uJc|'''Fw 189 A-1: Agile Eagle Owl''' - ''BaconGaming''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/303485-focke-wulf-fw-189-a-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Focke-Wulf}}\n{{Germany bombers}}\n{{Germany premium aircraft}}\n{{Winter Event}}"}}
