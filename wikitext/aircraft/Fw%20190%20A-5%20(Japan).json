In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27 as the ''Fw 190 A-5/U3'', but was renamed to ''Fw 190 A-5'' in Update 1.35.\n\nRocking four 20 mm cannons, an armoured radial engine and armoured fuel tanks, this aircraft is far but shy in the giving and taking role. Anything at 12 o'clock is soon to be smithereens. The wing root mounted cannons should be additionally placed on a separate key for head-on attacks. The outer-wing guns would only miss on distances of 800-1,000 m (~0.7 miles). This also helps for tricky shots, as the second pair of 20 mm guns only have 90 shots each, instead of the whopping 250 of the inner ones. But make sure to bring hell loose ones the optimal firing solution is reached.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Fw 190 A-5, as all the planes in this line, are some of the best Boom & Zoomers in the game and should be flown exclusively in this style. The performance at high speeds is excellent, as is their dive and zoom characteristics. '''Do not ever engage in a turn fight''' as this will most likely end badly, instead only fight in the vertical. Try to have an altitude, or speed advantage over the opponents (by climbing to the side at the start of the battle and then enter the highest dog fight). But the Fw 190 can still win fights when in a lower energy state than the foe.\n\nIn the defensive, best option is to just dive away from planes, such as [[Spitfire F Mk IX|Spitfires]] and [[La-5FN|La-5]]s, but it needs to be at a decent altitude to gain top speed, so do not be too quick to dive after an enemy if they are flying at a lower altitude. Unless the Fw 190 is higher than everybody else, or alone. Just be sure then to have the time to regain the lost altitude.\n\nIn a dive, the 190 can, due to its short wings, pull quite some ''stunts'' to either lose the hunter or even make him lose his own wings! This is favourable strategy against La-5s, [[Yak-9T|Yak]]s & Spitfires who have due to their low wing-loading (and partly wooden wings for the Russians), less resistance against high G manoeuvres. Again be sure to regain energy by a zoom-climb. Just look out while doing so, many pilots die as they do not notice a second enemy aircraft approaching. German proverb:''\"Wenn Zwei sich streiten, freut sich der Dritte.\"'' ~ \"When two quarrel, the third will reap the success.\" Of course, this could also be highlighting an opportunity to take in the skies.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The Fw 190 A-5 model was tested at the Fussa airfield, the Imperial Japanese Army's central testing facility for aircraft. The plane was flown by Lieutenant Commander Aramaki Yoshitsugu, who found the Fw 190 cockpit size just right as opposed to the tightness of the [[Bf_109_E-7_(Japan)|Bf 109]] or the spaciousness of a [[P-40E-1|P-40]].<ref name=\"ArawasiFw190\">Arawasi, 2014</ref>\n\nThe Fw 190 A-5 was also tested alongside Japanese aircraft and prototypes, including the prototypes that would be the [[Ki-84_ko|Ki-84]] and [[Ki-100]]. During these, it was deemed that the Fw 190 performance was similar to that of the Ki-84. Overall Japanese impression of the Fw 190 A-5 was positive, with better firepower than most other Japanese planes, reliable electric systems, fine craftsmanship, and a reliable engine.<ref name=\"ArawasiFw190\" />\n\nThe Allies predicted that the Japanese would use the Fw 190 as a fighter aircraft and gave the Fw 190 the nickname \"Fred\" in 1942.<ref name=\"DyerJapan\" /><ref name=\"HansonFred\">Hanson, n.d.</ref> However, it is not known if the Japanese ever used the Fw 190 in combat purposes against the Allies. The last known reported the presence of the Fw 190 A-5 was it being loaned to a reconnaissance unit, with its ultimate fate unknown but presumably lost.<ref name=\"ArawasiFw190\" />\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Wuerger (Shrike) was a single-seat, single-engine monoplane fighter used by the Luftwaffe in WWII. One of the best fighters of the time, it was widely used during the Second World War. A total of over 20,000 were produced, including some 6,000 fighter-bomber variants. The 190 remained in production from 1941 until the end of the war, going through multiple redesigns. The Fw 190 made a name for itself as a true Luftwaffe workhorse and was used in a wide variety of roles, including a high-altitude interceptor (especially the Fw 190 D), escort fighter, fighter-bomber and night fighter.\n\n1942 flight tests of the Fw 190 A-3 proved that the installation of additional equipment could shift the plane's center of gravity. To address the issue, the aircraft had to be lengthened. First examples, designated Fw 190 A-5, saw combat in November 1942. Other modifications were minor and included improved oxygen equipment and a new artificial horizon. All production aircraft were also equipped with the FuG 25a IFF set. The armament remained unchanged.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=japan&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=fw-190a-5_japan Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|vy_DJLkEe7M|'''Japanese FW-190 A-5 Review.
