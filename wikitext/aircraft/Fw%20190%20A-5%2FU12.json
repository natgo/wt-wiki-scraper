In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]], splitting the Fw 190 A-5 into a folder with /U12 and the /U2.\n\nThe A-5/U12, similar to other Fw 190s, is an excellent climber and diver while being a poor turner. The plane can manoeuvre vertically quite well and can out-dive opponents. However, after about 600 km/h the controls tend to stiffen up, so care should be taken while in dives.\n\nRocking two [[MG 151 (20 mm)|20 mm MG 151]] cannons, an armoured radial engine, armoured fuel tanks, and sometimes external gunpods, this aircraft is far from shy in the role of giving and taking. Anything at 12 o'clock is soon to be dead. The wing root mounted cannons should be additionally placed on a separate key for head-on attacks. You have a lot of ammunition at your expense, 1800 rounds of 7.92 mm [[MG 17 (7.92 mm)|MG 17]], and 500 rounds of 20 mm MG 151, meaning that aces are achievable in one sortie with excellent aim.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

The wing mounted cannons are armed with 250 rounds of ammunition each while the upper fuselage machine guns are armed with 900 rounds each.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAt the beginning of a battle, it is preferable to climb slightly to the sides to ensure that you have the altitude advantage over the enemy without having to encounter them head-on in a low energy climb state, while staying close enough to the engagement to intervene once they appear. It is important to note that, like all Fw 190s, the turn rate of the A-5/U12 is abysmal compared to most other aircraft you will meet, so out-turning opponents should not be attempted. However, the short wings on the plane are do give it an advantage over similar craft at its BR in terms of strength, and can easily survive several magnitudes of G-force - which is one of the few options available to the A-5/U12 for defence. Vertical engagements and energy retention are a must.\n\nOnce researched, the plane gains the option to mount two dual 20 mm MG 151 gun pods; however, as expected, this add-on hampers climb rate and aerodynamics and should be reserved for bomber hunting missions.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

One of the best fighters of the time, it was widely used during the Second World War. A total of over 20,000 were produced, including some 6,000 fighter-bomber variants. The 190 remained in production from 1941 until the end of the war, going through multiple redesigns. The Fw 190 made a name for itself as a true Luftwaffe workhorse and was used in a wide variety of roles, including a high-altitude interceptor (especially the Fw 190 D), escort fighter, fighter-bomber and night fighter.\n\n1942 flight tests of the Fw 190 A-3 proved that the installation of additional equipment could shift the plane's center of gravity. To address the issue, the aircraft had to be lengthened. First examples, designated Fw 190 A-5, saw combat in November 1942. Other modifications were minor and included improved oxygen equipment and a new artificial horizon. All production aircraft were also equipped with the FuG 25a IFF set. The armament remained unchanged.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=germany&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=fw-190a-5 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|3rItAzE_zVU|'''Gunpod Baby! or not?
