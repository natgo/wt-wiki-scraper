If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Fw-190 A-8 possesses far below average speed, acceleration, and climb ability for its rank. It does, however, have great high-speed control and a wicked armament that will shred any fighter almost instantly. It is recommended that you climb to the side and let your teammates engage first so you can put your excellent BnZ ability to work. If you spot a bandit co-alt, a head-on attack followed by an evasive manoeuvre and then extending away to repeat the processes is a recommended tactic. If a bandit has superior energy and is pressing an attack against you, try to drag them to friendlies, but don't sacrifice too much energy to do so. If you are skilled enough, another tactic would be to initiate a scissors; either rolling or flat, and then break away when he goes to yo-yo to control his overshoot. The scissors is a highly effective manoeuvre in the 190 A-8. If you are ballsy enough to press for a gun solution when scissoring an enemy, you could be greatly rewarded. In summary, climb to the side, Boom & Zoom like a champ, never get in a sustained turn fight, and use your rate of roll to free yourself when cornered.\n\n==== Specific enemies worth noting ====\nThe premium Fw 190 A-8 sits at a high battle rating, close to the Spitfire LF Mk. IX and La-7B-20, both of which are vastly superior planes overall. It frequently faces Tempests, Fw 190 A-5, Bf 109 G-10 variants, Griffon Spitfires and F4U-1C's. Unfortunately, the A-8 is by large worse than all of these planes, but it still possesses some unique advantages and if piloted correctly is really going to give anyone trouble. However, these advantages are quite predictable and easily nullified by an attentive opponent.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Very strong 4 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons\n* Great roll rate\n* Great energy retention\n* Heavy armament\n* Wide track landing gear makes landing easier \n* Plenty of ammo\n* Well armoured from the front\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Large, slow turn rate combined with no combat flaps greatly reduces dogfight efficiency\n* Elevator has low responsibility & effect on low-medium speeds\n* Manoeuvrability at low speeds is bad\n* Bad climb rate for a 190\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
