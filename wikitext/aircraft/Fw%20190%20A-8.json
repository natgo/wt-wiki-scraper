Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Fw 190 A-8 possesses far below average speed, acceleration, and climb ability for its rank. It does, however, have great high-speed control and a wicked armament that will shred any fighter almost instantly. It is recommended that you climb to the side and let your teammates engage first so you can put your excellent BnZ ability to work. You should climb to either 3000 meters altitude or 5000 meters and wait for friendlies to engage enemy aircraft first. Don't forget to use your flaps in a dive as the A-8 gains a massive amount of speed in a dive, generally resulting in overshooting the target if he is distracted with a dogfight. Don't worry about your flaps breaking as they can survive speeds up to 900 km/h, far faster than you're ever going to go in combat.\n\nIf you spot a bandit co-alt, a head-on attack followed by an evasive manoeuvre and then extending away to repeat the process is a recommended tactic. If a bandit has superior energy and is pressing an attack against you, try to drag them to friendlies, but don't sacrifice too much energy to do so. If you are skilled enough, another tactic would be to initiate a scissors manoeuvre; either rolling or flat, and then break away when he goes to yo-yo to control his overshoot. The scissors is a highly effective manoeuvre in the 190 A-8. If you are ballsy enough to press for a gun solution when scissoring an enemy, you could be greatly rewarded. In summary, climb to the side, BnZ like a champ, never get in a sustained turn fight, and use your rate of roll to free yourself when cornered.\n\nThe Fw 190 A-8 sits at a high battle rating, close to the [[Spitfire LF Mk IX]] and [[La-7B-20]], both of which are vastly superior planes overall. It frequently faces [[Tempest (Family)|Tempests]], [[Fw 190 A-5]], [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109 G variants]], [[Spitfire (Family)|Griffon Spitfires]] and [[F4U-1C]]'s. Unfortunately, the A-8 is by and large worse than all of these planes, but it still possesses some unique advantages and if piloted correctly is going to give anyone trouble. However, these advantages are quite predictable and easily countered by an attentive opponent.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It culminated with the lengthened airframe of the A-5 (to reduce vibrations) and led to the development of the following variants:\n\n* Fw 190 A-6: developed in 1943, it integrated a new wing design to reduce wing loading and two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons replacing both wing-mounted 20 mm MG/FF cannons together with larger ammunition boxes.\n* Fw 190 A-7: introduced in December 1943, it saw the replacement of both nose-mounted 7.7 mm MGs with 13 mm MG131 machine guns.\n* Fw 190 A-8: introduced in 1944, the A-8 was the same aircraft as the A-7. The main improvement was the injection boost system \"GM1\" for the BMW 801 engine. The system injected nitrous oxide into the cylinders to raise the engine's power limit for a period reaching 10 minutes. A 115 L fuel tank was also installed to increase the range and wing-mounted 30 mm cannons were added as optional armament. The {{PAGENAME}} went into production in February 1944 and 6,655 units were produced between 1944 and 1945.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe {{PAGENAME}} saw combat extensively: it was used as a fighter during Operation Bodenplatte (Battle of the Bulge) in 1944 and to intercept USAF and RAF night bomber formations in 1944 and 1945 over Germany.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n{{Youtube-gallery|vtCKzvbLfNg|'''The Shooting Range #18''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:03 discusses the Fw 190A.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Fw 190 A-8 (USA)]], the premium American version.\n* [[NC.900]], the gift French version.\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/129411-fw-190-a-8-sncac-nc900/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Focke-Wulf_Fw_190|[Wikipedia] Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]\n* [http://www.airvectors.net/avfw190.html <nowiki>[Air Vectors]</nowiki> The Focke-Wulf Fw 190]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Focke-Wulf}}\n{{Germany fighters}}"}}
