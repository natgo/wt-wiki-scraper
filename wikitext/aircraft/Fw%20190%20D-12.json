If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Fw 190 D-12 was developed and tested alongside the [[Fw 190 D-13]]. They share the same airframe and engine performance with the only difference between the D-12 and the D-13 being the cannon mounted in the propeller. (The D-12 was tested with a Mk 108 30 mm cannon while the D-13 was tested with an MG 151 20 mm cannon in the propeller)\n\nDue to the D-12 and D-13 being so similar, you can fly them almost identically. (Keeping in mind the differing armament velocities at longer ranges)  the Fw 190 D-12 has a high top speed for its BR, heavy armament with a large ammunition pool, a fantastic engine built for high-altitude performance and it features hydraulic ailerons for an amazingly high-speed roll rate. It is one of the only prop driven aircraft able to reach speeds exceeding 450 MPH/725 KPH while still retaining some ability to manoeuvre. The D-12 is an energy fighter, the plane relies on speed and engine power to be successful. With its high burst mass of and the destructive power of the minengeschoße, no bomber in the game can survive a short burst. Against fighters, the MK 108 is as usual difficult to aim and hit. Not to mention just overkill. As both guns have different ballistics, bind a separate key for your MG 151s. This makes aiming easier, saves ammo and is still sufficient enough against any fighter.\n\nThe Fw 190 D-12 is most effective at climbing above your foe and employing standard Boom and Zoom tactics. Keeping in mind that at 700 kph+, the flight surfaces of the Dora series notoriously compress and pulling out at those speeds can be tricky, however, it has been found that because of the fuselage mounted fuel tanks in the Dora series, taking higher fuel loads will cut the amount of time it takes to pull out of those high-speed dives by up to 50% (50% when comparing minimum fuel load to full fuel load.(As of 1.71.1))\n\nOne of the most known abilities of the Fw 190 series is their ability to out roll enemies such as the Spitfire that \"lock up\" at higher speeds. If attacked from above and if the enemy is at a higher speed than the D-12, it is possible to perform a series of rolls called a \"scissors\". The goal of this manoeuvre is to both avoid the enemy's guns by rolling out of the way as well as allowing that enemy to overshoot, resulting in the Dora pilot tailing the would-be killer. Although difficult, manoeuvres such as these can turn the tables in a one-on-one dogfight and ensure survival.\n\nAttempt every deflection shot possible, and if the rounds are not hitting the target pull harder. It is better to have rounds fly in front of an enemy plane than miles behind them. In order to pull ahead, make good use of combat/landing flaps. However, remember not to activate them at high speeds as they will rip off causing a momentary loss of control.\n\nThe role of the ''Bomb Dora'' can be done by any 190 D. A wide arrangement of payloads is possible. But none of them is powerful enough to go for strategic bomb zones. In addition the 50 kg bombs can only be dropped in pairs in RB & SB. In combination with the lack of an aiming reticle, it is suggested to not carry the small bombs in addition  to your ''main'' payload. Bridges, heavy tanks and heavy pillboxes should be the primary target for the 500 kg bomb. The other targets can be destroyed with ease by allied [[:Category:Attackers|attackers]].\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

One of the best fighters of the time, it was widely used during the Second World War. A total of over 20,000 were produced, including some 6,000 fighter-bomber variants. The 190 remained in production from 1941 until the end of the war, going through multiple redesigns. The Fw 190 made a name for itself as a true Luftwaffe workhorse and was used in a wide variety of roles, including a high-altitude interceptor (especially the Fw 190D), escort fighter, fighter-bomber and night fighter.\n\nThe Fw 190 D 'Dora', or 'Long-Nosed 190' to the Allies, was intended as an interim solution while the Ta 152 was being readied. However, the Dora ended up being one of the finest Focke-Wulf designs of the entire war. The aircraft was armed with two synchronized MG 17s and four wing-mounted MG 151s. Initially, Luftwaffe pilots regarded the Dora with some suspicion. The Jumo 213 was believed to be a bomber engine and its installation on a fighter was considered a desperate measure. However, as soon as they had a chance to fight in the Dora-9, the pilots changed their minds. The new variant, compared to its BMW 801-powered predecessor, performed better in the vertical and in a dive. Additionally, it had a phenomenal roll rate. The pilots quickly found that the Jumo 213-powered Focke-Wulf was superior to the venerable P-51B Mustang.\n\nA total of 650 to 700 Fw 190 D series fighters were produced. By December 1944, the Focke-Wulf plant in Marienburg produced 8 Fw 190 Ds each day, even though the factory appeared completely destroyed from the air.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.ru/index.php?/topic/94911-fw-190-d-12/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance (Russian Forum)]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Focke-Wulf}}\n{{Germany fighters}}"}}
