{"title":"Fw 200 C-1","pageid":282,"wikitext":{"*":"{{Specs-Card\n|code=fw_200c_1\n|images={{Specs-Card-Image|GarageImage_{{PAGENAME}}.jpg}}\n}}\n\n== Description ==\n<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.47 \"Big Guns\"]].\n\nThe Focke-Wulf Fw 200 C-1 is a long-range maritime patrol bomber. It is optimised for bombing stationary targets, such as bases and pillboxes, from medium to high altitudes.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Condor handles, as all long range bombers, like a flying brick. Its turns are cumbersome and it is best to climb gradually, slowly gathering speed. Once at an altitude of 4,000-5,000 metres it is best to fly straight and level to the target. Always keep a significant distance between yourself and any enemies. If you miss a base always fly for a short distance before turning to have another go, as the large turning circle could cause you to miss again. Once you have expended all your bombs, reduce throttle to 0% and gradually descend towards your base. Keep an eye on your speed so you don't rip your wings off. Despite its size the Condor is surprisingly easy to land, but make sure you aren't going too fast and you have enough runway.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 1,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* 8 mm steel - pilots seat\n* Fuel tanks located between wing root and out-most engine, as well as taking up most of the fuselage\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nFirst, obtain the bomb upgrade (ITC PVC/II). This will allow the installation of 6 x 500 kg bombs, the best payload for base bombing, since it allows the destruction of two bases in one pass. There will be no need to hurry with the second upgrade. The 2 x 1,000 kg + 2 x 500 kg loadout is only ideal for taking out airfields or carriers. Flight performance upgrades come next in the priority list, as the aircraft is heavy and slow. The ammo belts are of a lesser priority, since the upgraded belts don't make a considerable difference.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers.

Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|MG 15 (7.92 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, nose turret (2,250 rpg)\n* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, chin turret (1,500 rpg)\n* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, dorsal turret (1,125 rpg)\n* 1 x 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, ventral turret (1,125 rpg)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe graceful looks of the Condor belie a very vulnerable and slow aircraft. Essentially a converted civilian airliner, the Condor has a very weak airframe and large fuel tanks scattered throughout the aircraft, making it vulnerable to even rifle-calibre bullets.\n\nTo make things worse, the Condor is rather underpowered, despite having four engines. It is outrun by biplane fighters and has a very poor climb rate. The defensive armament is also very poor, consisting of only 7.92 mm machine guns with blind spots in the coverage. If caught by enemy fighters, it has virtually no chance of survival.\n\nThe one redeeming factor of the Condor is its massive payload of 3,000 kg bombs. It is one of the heaviest bomb loads carried by any non-premium German bomber, except for the Dornier Do 217 series, the Messerschmitt Me 264, and the He 177. If the Condor can penetrate enemy air defences, it is capable of inflicting massive damage to bases.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Its mission was to either attack the convoys directly with bombs or communicate their location to the packs of German U-boats below. The Condor started as a transatlantic airliner that first flew in July of 1937. By September of 1939, over 250 Condors had entered military service. The Condor spawned many sub-variants that included different armament, radar, missile carriage and guidance systems, and transport. A handful of these aircraft were used for VIP transports.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fw_200c_1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|hZkupQZmfyc|'''The Shooting Range #163''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:44 discusses the Fw 200.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Focke-Wulf}}\n{{Germany bombers}}"}}
