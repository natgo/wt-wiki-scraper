Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe H6K4 has decidedly bad flight performance given its large size. The aircraft has an abysmal top speed, meaning that it can be outrun by most biplanes at its battle rating. As well, the aircraft has lacklustre acceleration, and an almost-nonexistent climb rate. The aircraft's manoeuvrability is just as bad, given its massive size - turning and rolling are all rather difficult manoeuvres to perform. The aircraft can feel extremely sluggish (basically a brick with wings) when performing manoeuvres, even more so than conventional heavy bombers. The aircraft's camera angle in AB/RB is also extremely weird, as it looks downwards onto the aircraft. On the plus side, the aircraft has a slow stall speed, to permit its use as a hydroplane.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,100 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe H6K4 is an interesting aircraft to fly in air battles, given its massive size, decent defensive armament and ordnance load. The aircraft can be used as a conventional bomber in Air battles, delivering its large payload on bases. It can also be used in naval battles, with its large load of two torpedoes and the ability to cap bases. However, no matter what way you play this aircraft, be aware that it is huge. The large size of the aircraft makes it an attractive target for fighters, SPAAs and naval AA guns alike.\n\nThe first possible playstyle for the H6K4 is that of a conventional bomber - the aircraft's large payload of 1,600 kg (2 x 800 kg) allows it to destroy bases with ease. However, there are several limitations to this approach that should be considered. Firstly, the aircraft lacks landing gear (because it is a hydroplane), meaning that it is unable to land on conventional airfields. You can still try, but take care to land the aircraft slowly to avoid the risk of crashing. As well, the aircraft only carries two bombs max - this limits the number of bases, or targets, that you can hit. Depending on circumstance, a single bomb may not be enough to destroy a base - in that case, you will need to expend both bombs on a single base.\n\nThe second option for this aircraft would be in naval battles. The aircraft's large armament and floatplane abilities allow it to be used as a base-capper. The aircraft carries a pair of Type 91 torpedoes (Model 2 or 3) which are highly effective against any target up to destroyer-size. However, these torpedoes will be hard to aim against small targets such as MTBs, as smaller vessels are typically very manoeuvrable. Note that you may want to attack from afar when flying this aircraft - the aircraft is unarmoured, and any hits from ship-based AA guns may set your large plane on fire.\n\nIf being pursued by enemy fighters, the H6K4's massive size and slow speed will prevent it from running away effectively. Thus, your only hope would be the H6K4's defensive armament - this is one sector where the H6K4 excels. Being a Japanese bomber, the H6K is very well armed for its BR and carries a total of five guns. There are four single 7.7 mm machine guns, and a 20 mm cannon in the tail position. However, note that the H6K4 doesn't have any defensive positions underneath the fuselage - after all, it is a hydroplane. This means that you are completely vulnerable from underneath. To remedy this, attempt to bait pursuing aircraft above you or behind - this way, they can be hit by the highly-effective 20 mm cannon defending the rear.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

An experimental version, the Type S, made its first flight on July 14, 1936. The plane was approved by the Imperial Japanese Navy as Type 97 Large Flying Boat in 1937. Mass production began in 1938.\n\nThe most common variant was model 22 (H6K4), created in 1940. The first 119 planes were fitted with a air-cooled 14-cylinder twin-row radial Mitsubishi Kinsei 43 engine (1,000 hp). Afterwards, the slightly more powerful Kinsei 46 was used. The H6K4 carried more fuel than earlier models, increasing its maximum range to 25 hours, or 6,000 km. Its fuselage included waist blisters fitted with machine guns, which required a slightly longer tail section.\n\nThe H6K4 was armed with four 7.7 mm Type 97 (Lewis) machine guns with 582 rounds apiece and, in the tail turret, one 20mm Type 99-I cannon with 432 rounds. The flying boat could carry twelve 60-kg bombs, four 250-kg bombs, or two 800-kg Type 91 Model 1 torpedoes.\n\nA major weakness of all H6K flying boats was the lack of protective armour for the crew and for the fuel tanks. This was sacrificed for the sake of its extended flight range. When the plane started to suffer losses in combat, designers of later Model 22 planes began to focus on protecting the crew.\n\nThe H6K flying boat's first combat action was a raid on Wake Island on December 11, 1941. The plane was widely used in the Pacific theater during the first part of the war. The H6K ran long-range reconnaissance missions, convoy escort duty, submarine searches, bombing missions, and search and rescue operations. When the newer H8K arrived, the H6K began to be used mostly as a transport plane. The plane was in operation until the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\n127 H6K4s were built, out of a total of 217 H6Ks.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=h6k4 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|DoZLyWJ5lRw|'''The Shooting Range #222''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:55 discusses air combats between the {{PAGENAME}} and B-17s in the Pacific.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[H8K2]]\n* [[H8K3]]\n\n;Aircraft of a similar role, configuration or era\n\n* [[PBY-5 Catalina]]\n* [[Sunderland Mk IIIa]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/314787-kawanishi-h6k4-mod-22/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kawanishi}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
