However, there are some key differences between the two aircraft. The H8K2 can be used in both Naval battles, and Air battles, though there are some key limitations. The aircraft has a strong defensive armament suite of ten guns (five 20 mm cannons and five 7.7 mm machine guns), and can also carry a pair of torpedoes. However, it is a very large aircraft, and is easily shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire. In general, the aircraft should avoid close-in, frontline combat, and instead be used as a heavy bomber/support aircraft.\n\nThe first playstyle for this aircraft would be a heavy bomber in RB. The aircraft benefits from airspawn, meaning that it is much less vulnerable from interception. However, there is one key limitation to this role - the H8K2's tiny payload. The aircraft can only carry a maximum of 1,600 kg of bombs, in two 800 kg bombs. This effectively limits the aircraft to destroying a single base, which doesn't yield great bonuses. The 800 kg bombs are also ineffective against ground targets, as they drop together. This means that the only viable option against ground targets are the 60 kg bombs. However, these are also rather ineffective due to their tiny size and low explosive mass.\n\nThe second, and more interesting playstyle would be in Naval RB. The aircraft is a floatplane, meaning that it can be used to cap bases. As well, the aircraft can carry two torpedoes, which are very effective against larger vessels. Thus, the aircraft could be used as a torpedo-bomber, staying low and attacking enemies with torpedoes from a distance. However, do not approach to close to enemy naval vessels, as the H8K is massive and an easy target for enemy AAA.\n\nWhen being attacked, one excellent option is the H8K's defensive armament. The 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannons are essentially upgraded MG FF cannons, and can do extensive damage to attacking fighters. However, take note that the aircraft has very limited protection from the underside, similar to other flying boats. Try to bait attacking fighters to your six (and slightly to the right or left), so that you can engage them with the tail, dorsal and beam turrets.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In 1938, just as its predecessor, the H6K, was entering service, the Imperial Navy ordered the development of a larger aircraft with longer range suited for solo bombing and patrol missions. The resulting H8K flying boats, entering service in February 1942, performed well until the end of the war, and were respected by allied pilots for their fearsome defensive armament. After the war, an H8K2 (one of only four which survived the war) was captured by American forces, and was eventually returned to Japan in 1979, where it remains on display to this day.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=h8k2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/880|[Devblog] The Aerial Cruiser of Japan: H8K2 and H8K3]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/307703-kawanishi-h8k2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kawanishi}}\n{{Japan bombers}}"}}
