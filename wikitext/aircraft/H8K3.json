Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nThe H8K3 was a prototype variant of the H8K2. It was modified to allow the dorsal turret and the landing floats to retract, as well as to include fowler flaps, and the blisters which housed the side guns were replaced with sliding hatches. All such changes were made in order to reduce drag and thereby increase speed (Note: None of the turret modifications are currently modeled in game). A total of only 2 were built.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/307704-kawanishi-h8k3/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kawanishi}}\n{{Japan bombers}}\n{{Japan premium aircraft}}"}}
