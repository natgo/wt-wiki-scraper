In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]].\n\nThe Hampden is one of the first bombers you get in the British tree, and without a doubt defines the style of flying for the remainder of the tree. Its decent performance combined with all-powerful bomb load can quickly rack your score up into the thousands. On maps like Essen, use your superior speed to bomb the ground targets before any other bombers, then drop your altitude and rearm at the airfield. After, fly low with a bomb delay and hit the remaining targets or bases.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Hampden Mk I is an average early bomber which, though rather average, should not be taken lightly. It is able to take quite a large bombload for its size, allowing it to take out bomb points and ground targets with ease.\n\nThe below tactics can be used in all games modes:\n\n'''How to offensively engage an enemy aircraft:'''\n\nIf you happen to see an enemy aircraft, you should not engage it. Only in cases where it's the last enemy player or it should be at and disadvantage should the Hampden be brave enough to attack an enemy aircraft. Hampden should try and climb above the enemy then dive to get in front of target. Then use its defensive four 7.7 mm machine guns to tear into enemy aircraft's cockpit and knock out the pilot, engines and any gunners. This way try to use the defensive armaments in an offensive way. The single offensive .30 cal machine gun might not put out enough firepower to take out enemy aircraft, other than some reserve and lower battle rating aircraft, since it's only a single .30 cal with 300 rounds which will limit the damage the Hampden can do.\n\n'''How to perform defensive fighting:'''\nBest way for the Hampden Mk I to defend itself is by trying to get the enemy aircraft to get on the rear where its 4 x 7.7 mm Vickers K machine guns have the coverage to be able to fire at the enemy. Lacking 360 degree turrets makes the Vickers have a limited area of coverage and leaves a lot of the plane exposed for enemy fighters to swoop in from. So best course of action is to get them on the Hampden's tail.\n\nShould an enemy fighter move to engage the Hampden, do not try to outmanoeuvre it. Simply dive and go as low as possible while in gunner view and aim for the enemy's engine. Try and damage it or give it some critical damage to fend it off. If one is lucky it will burst into flames or the pilot be knocked out and it will be out of the battle for good.\n\n==== Specific enemies worth noting ====\nThe planes to be feared are usually those that carry cannons or 12.7 mm machine guns. These kind of planes can easily cause heavy damage to the Hampden.\nPlanes like: [[P-400]], [[P-40 (Family)|P-40]], [[LaGG-3 (Family)|LaGG-3]], [[Ki-45 (Family)|Ki-45]] and [[J22-B]]. But those are not the only threats, since there are many more aircraft that will be a considerable threat to Hampden Mk I.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was designed to meet Air Ministry Specification B.9/32 which called for a faster, heavier, and more powerful bomber that would replace the existing Bristol Blenheim and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. The designer, G.V Vokert, designed an interesting prototype, designated HP.52. This plane was originally powered by Napier Sabre Dagger engines, but switched to the more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines. Originally the Hampden had two Vickers K gun in ventral and dorsal positions, which proved to be inadequate for daylight defence. This was then switched to two Vickers K guns with modifications. The Hampden had many nicknames, because of the slim, compact and cramped fuselage it was nicknamed the \"Flying Suitcase\". It was oddly similar in role and appearance to the German fast day-bomber [[Do 17 (Family)|Do 17]], which had the nickname \"Flying Pencil\".\n\nRAF Squadron No.49 was the first to receive their new Hampdens. Bearing the brunt of early bombing raids on Europe. The Hampden proved no match for Luftwaffe fighters. It was subsequently switched to various night time operations, such as mine-laying, bombing raids on German soil, propaganda and torpedo bombing. Despite having great speed and manoeuvrability, the Hampden was declared obsolete and retired from service in 1942.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=hp52_hampden_mk1_late Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/342039-handley-page-hampden-mk-1-tb-1-tb-1-utk/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Handley}}\n{{Britain bombers}}"}}
