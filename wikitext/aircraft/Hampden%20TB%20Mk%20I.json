It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]].\n\nThe Hampden is one of the first few bombers you get in the British tree, and without a doubt defines the style of flying you for the remainder of the tree. Its decent performance combined with all-powerful bomb load can quickly rack your score up into the thousands. On maps like Essen, use your superior speed to bomb the ground targets before any other bombers, then drop your altitude and rearm at the airfield. Then fly low with a bomb delay and hit the remaining targets or bases.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

With a mediocre defensive armament and only a single offensive 7.7 mm machine gun, engaging enemy aircraft is an absolute last resort. The lack of defensive capabilities, combined with the thin tail and wings, make the Hampden TB a fragile aircraft. Upon spawning, climb at a very shallow angle to increase your speed and altitude at the same time. When the bomb points are in range, level off and drop your load. This will make you significantly lighter and allow you to return to base extremely quickly. During this time, one must take care to avoid aircraft that will now be at your altitude. A shallow dive will allow a boost in speed, and a corkscrew over the airfield will let you drop the remaining altitude without ripping due to speed.\n\nUsually, you should avoid enemies, and attempt to stay as fast and as unnoticed as possible. Having an escort helps.\n\nThe below tactics can be used in all games modes:\n\n'''How to offensively engage an enemy aircraft:'''\n\nIf you happen to see an enemy aircraft, you should not engage. Only in cases that he is the last enemy player should you dare to attack him. Try and climb above him then dive to get in front of him. Then use your four 7.7 mm defensive machine guns to tear into his cockpit and knock out his pilot, engines and forward gunners.\n\n'''How to perform defensive fighting:'''\n\nShould an enemy fighter move to engage you, do not try to outmanoeuvre him. Simply dive and go as low as you safely can while in gunner view and aim for his engine. Try and damage it or give him some nasty leaks to scare him off. If you're lucky he will burst into flames and fall to the ground.\n\nThe planes to be feared are usually those that carry cannons or 12.7 mm machine guns. Those planes will easily shred this plane with no problems as it does not react well to damage. Flak will normally result in a pilot snipe, and then a kill, and has a tendency to tear the engines to pieces.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was designed to meet Air Ministry Specification B.9/32 which called for a faster, heavier, and more powerful bomber that would replace the existing Bristol Blenheim and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. The designer, G.V Vokert, designed an interesting prototype, designated HP.52. This plane was originally powered by Napier Sabre Dagger engines, but switched to the more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines. Originally the Hampden had two Vickers K guns in ventral and dorsal positions, which proved to be inadequate for daylight defence. This was then switched to two Vickers K guns with modifications. The Hampden had many nicknames, because of the slim, compact and cramped fuselage. It was nicknamed the \"Flying Suitcase\". It was oddly similar in role and appearance to the German fast day-bomber Do 17, nicknamed the \"Flying Pencil\".\n\nRAF Squadron No.49 was the first to receive their new Hampdens. Bearing the brunt of early bombing raids on Europe. The Hampden proved no match for Luftwaffe fighters. It was subsequently switched to various night time operations, such as mine-laying, bombing raids on German soil, propaganda and torpedo bombing. Despite having great speed and manoeuvrability, the Hampden was declared obsolete and retired from service in 1942.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=hp52_hampden_tbmk1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Lec0mwCN81I|'''The Shooting Range #84''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 10:41 discusses the Hampden TB Mk I.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Hampden (Family)]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* Dornier [[Do 17 E-1|Do 17]]\n* Junkers [[Ju 88 (Family)|Ju 88]]\n* Lioré et Olivier [[LeO 451 early|LeO 45]]\n* Martin [[B-10B|B-10]]\n* Yokosuka [[P1Y1 mod. 11|P1Y]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/342039-handley-page-hampden-mk-1-tb-1-tb-1-utk/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Handley}}\n{{Britain bombers}}"}}
