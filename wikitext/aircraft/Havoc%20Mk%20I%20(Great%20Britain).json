It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. The Havoc Mk I is an excellent all-round bomber for its BR. The combination of speed, agility, and a forward-facing armament of 4 x .303 Brownings coupled with 4 x 500 lb bombs makes the Havoc a very versatile platform. Its speed allows the bomber to quickly enter and exit the combat area, run down other bombers or, act as a heavy fighter. The aircraft is capable of flying on a single engine, giving it a higher chance of surviving an engagement and making it back to base. In general, the Havoc has a sturdy airframe, capable of tanking large volumes of rifle-calibre machine gun fire (the most common weapon around its BR). The defensive armament of 2 separate .303 Vickers K machine guns is sufficient.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n'''General advice'''\n\nThe relatively high speed of the Havoc gives it plenty of options during a battle, at the start of the battle the player can engage in different valid tactics, such as hunting bombers, bombing ground targets or intercepting climbing fighters. A general advice is to keep altitude, bomb ground targets and then search for enemies to engage. The 4 x .303 Brownings can make short work of any fighter at its BR.\n\nIn general, the Havoc Mk I will face slower but more manoeuvrable opponents, especially when they are still climbing to altitude, the player can exploit this by booming and zooming the climbing fighters giving a tactical advantage to its own team. Do not engage in turnfights with enemy fighters.\n\nAnother tactic is to bomb ground targets, quickly return to base and rearm in order to make two or more runs on enemy ground targets. A well placed bomb will make short work of any medium tank of pillbox, the machine guns are enough to take out vehicles, AAA and artillery.\n\n'''Most notable enemies'''\n\nThe most notable enemies for the Havoc Mk I are fast (climbing) fighters such as the [[Ki-44 (Family)|Ki-44]], [[MiG-3 (Family)|MiG-3]], [[He 100 D-1|He 100]], [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109 E/F]], and heavily armed interceptors such as the [[Bf 110 (Family)|Bf 110 C]], [[Pe-3]], [[Yak-2 KABB]] etc. The fighters can generally keep pace with the Havoc while the interceptors' heavy armament can make short work of your airframe. The best way to engage these opponents is to:\n\n* Use boom and zoom tactics if you are in a higher energy state (i.e, higher and faster)\n\n* Run towards friendlies and pepper the enemy with your defensive armament if in an equal or lower energy state (i.e. same altitude/speed). Your speed can keep you alive to fight another day!\n\nSlower and more manoeuvrable enemies are generally easy to avoid by flying away (use a slight dive). You will however have a hard time engaging them as they can easily avoid your shots.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

After liaising with the USAAC to discuss the exact requirements, it became clear that a twin engine design would be necessary for the payload and firepower required. Designed with an unconventional tricycle undercarriage and a modular nose section to allow a quicker change between the bomber or attack role, the new Model 7B first flew in October 1938. However, even after the success of the highly manoeuvrable prototype, the USAAC stated that they had no interest in the Model 7B so Douglas began to investigate their options of selling the aircraft on the export market. France was the first company to order the new DB-7 (Douglas Bomber); but after France was defeated by Germany in 1940, arrangements were made to ship the remainder of France's order to Britain. The DB7 initially entered service with the RAF as the Boston Mk I and was used as a multi-engine conversion trainer.\n\nThe British Air Ministry was impressed with the new aircraft, and continued orders from Douglas. Another variant of the aircraft was given the name Havoc Mk I and was fitted with an Airborne Interception radar, additional armour and nose mounted Browning 0.303 inch machine guns to be used as a night fighter. The navigator's cockpit and the nose glazing remained intact. The aircraft was painted matt black and flame damping exhaust systems were installed in an attempt to add an element of night camouflage. A basic set of second flying controls were also added to the gunner's position, as it was impossible to access the pilot during flight and, in the event of an emergency, the gunner could at least attempt to fly the aircraft to a landing if the pilot was incapacitated. A further modification of this was the Havoc Mk I (Intruder) which had four 0.303 inch machine guns fitted beneath the bomb aimer's position.\n\nThe Havoc's impressive performance did, however, come at a price – the aircraft's range was severely limiting. With this in mind, RAF Bomber Command utilised the Havoc in anti-shipping strikes and night airfield raids over Holland. One tactic employed was for a Havoc to pretend to be a German aircraft that had dropped behind its group: it would fire signal flares over an enemy airfield and turn on its navigation lights as if about to land. If the ruse was successful, the night runway lights would be illuminated, allowing the Havoc to attack the enemy airfield with far greater ease. A bombing run whilst enemy aircraft were landing could also be particularly effective; as well as destroying enemy aircraft on the ground it also cause panic among enemy anti-aircraft gunners who would then open fire on all machines in the air, including their own. Sometimes, after several of these raids in a row, the Germans would even open fire on their own aircraft assuming they were British \"blockers\".\n\nSome 140 DB7s originally intended for French service were acquired by RAF Bomber Command for use as Havocs, with a further 40 of these being converted to the Intruder role.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=intruder_mk_1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|rXFmazQuIvU|'''Premium Review, {{PAGENAME}}.
