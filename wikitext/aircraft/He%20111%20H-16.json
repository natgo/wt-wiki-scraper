Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nIn Arcade, try to maximize altitude upon spawning; this will make it harder for most fighters to reach you in the early moments (only for ground strike). However, this leaves your poorly defended underbelly open to most attacks, so a fighter with a decent engine could easily catch up and take you down. When engaging this bomber, don't worry about the gunners, as they have a very restricted field of, allowing an attack from these angles: 10-2 o'clock high or even 8 o'clock high/5 o'clock high, as well as 9-3 o'clock low or 10 o'clock low/2 o'clock low, as the gunners, cannot reach you there.\n\nIn Realistic, as mid-air reload is unavailable, the He 111 can be used as a pseudo-dive bomber to quickly deliver its payload before retreating. The plane can sustain a shallow dive near the redline speed of around 500 km/h, though you should keep an eye on the IAS to prevent from overspeeding and ripping the airframe in the process. The payload of 8 x 250 kg bombs or 2 x 1,000 kg bombs is enough to destroy two bases in normal matches and one in uptier matches. While the single 2,500 kg bomb is certainly very powerful, it can only destroy a single base and wastes potential TNT damage in doing so, thus it should be saved for airfield bombing instead.\n\nIn mixed battles, the He 111 H-16 can be played like a miniature [[Pe-8]]. While the SC2500 bomb is nowhere close to the infamous [[FAB-5000 (5,000 kg)|FAB-5000]] bomb, the SC2500 has a massive filler of 2,720 kg of TNT equivalent and a huge destructive radius of 84 m (\"only\" 21 m less than the FAB-5000) which is still huge enough to destroy multiple ground vehicles and sink any ship within its blast radius. With its smaller and less distinctive airframe, the H-16 can be played more aggressively than its Soviet counterpart, with an option of shallow dive bombing for a more precise drop.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The He 111 H-16 was the third standard H-series variant, the other two being H-3 and H-6. Most other variants were generally used in very specialized roles. Specifically, the H-16 was a further development of the H-6 with Jumo 211 F-2 engines, although several other interim variants also introduced minor changes based on combat experience. Defensive armament remained the same as on the H-11.\n\nMany different loadouts were supported; the bomb bay was retained and could also be used for extra fuel tanks. In the latter case, the under-fuselage ETC 2000 bomb rack was used. The H-16 was supplied with several armament kits, including the R-1 with a 13 mm MG 131 in a dorsal turret, the R-2, a glider tug and the R-3, with improved armour at the cost of a lighter bomb carrying capacity.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=he-111h-16_winter Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Tupolev [[SB 2M (Family)|SB]]\n* [[Martin 167-A3]] Maryland\n* Mitsubishi [[Ki-21-Ia]]\n* Martin [[B-10B]]\n* [[Martin 139WC]]\n* Fiat [[BR.20 DR]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/504141-heinkel-he-111h-16/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Heinkel}}\n{{Germany bombers}}"}}
