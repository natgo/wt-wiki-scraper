It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe He 111 H-3 will often find itself in light vehicle battles due to its battle rating. The sole purpose of the He 111 H-3 is to destroy as many ground targets as it possibly can to aid in winning the match.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nUpon spawning, you should put the plane into a slight climb, so it gains speed and altitude. Head immediately to nearest key ground targets. You can ask your teammates to provide escort, but the He 111 H-3 is quite durable and can absorb a lot of damage before falling. Next, drop your payload into the targets. Here, it is better to use the 32 x 50 kg bombs, as the 8 x 250 kg will be better suited for bombing bases and isn't needed to destroy vehicles.\n\nIn battles without bases, it would be wise to immediately head toward and carpet bomb targets after spawning, either until you are dead or have destroyed all key targets in an area. Most of your adversaries won't be equipped with cannons, so if enemy fighters decide to attack you, you can act as a distraction while your teammates eliminate key targets.\n\nIn ground strike maps with tanks, equip the 8 x 250 kg bombs and either do high altitude base bombing or go for their tanks, ships or pillboxes. A bombing run with the 8 x 250 kg will be enough to destroy a bombing point, and a single direct hit from a 250 kg bomb will surely destroy any ground targets like pillboxes and heavy tanks. Lead the targets before dropping your bombs; it's not easy but becomes easier with practice. If you're not used to bombing moving targets, hit static ones like pillboxes.\n\nYou can do the same thing as stated for Arcade mode, which also works well in Realistic/Simulator Battles, or just go for bases with the 8 x 250 kg loadout. 2,000 kg will be enough to destroy a bombing point. Just ensure that you stay alive during your trip back to the base.\n\nIn Ground RB, carry the bomb load of 32 x 50 kg load out, as at your BR most enemies will be lightly armoured and only 2 or 3 bombs will be required to take them out. A good strategy when using this plane is to fly over enemy and allied capture points, as this is where most of your targets will be. Use your bombsight to pinpoint targets on the ground, then bombs away! Remember not to spend all your bombs on one target which is what most beginner pilots will do in this plane. Instead, drop around 5 bombs in a straight line near the target(s). Do this until your bomb load is exhausted.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The type was supplied to Romania and also license-built in that country. The subsequent H-4 and 5 variants were powered by improved engines and featured increased bomb loads.<ref>Green, William. Warplanes of the Third Reich. New York: Galahad Books, 1990</ref>\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Heinkel He 111 was a German monoplane medium bomber (also torpedo bomber and attack bomber). The Hе 111 H-3 entered production in November 1939 and could also be used in a naval bomber role. However, its defensive armament was not particularly effective, with limited defensive arcs and a very low rate of fire of only 540 rounds per minute.\n\nThe He 111 H-3 had a crew of five, but when used in a maritime role, this would usually be increased to six. The bomber was powered by Jumo 211 D-1 engines with a takeoff power of 1,200 HP. Up to 2,000 kg of bombs could be housed in the bomb bay; the left section of the bay could also house extra fuel tanks.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=he-111h-2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Tupolev [[SB 2M (Family)|SB 2M]]\n* [[Martin 167-A3]] Maryland\n* Mitsubishi [[Ki-21 (Family)|Ki-21]]\n* Martin [[B-10B]]\n* [[Martin 139WC]]\n* Fiat [[BR.20 DR]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/504143-heinkel-he-111h-3/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{AirManufacturer Heinkel}}\n{{Germany bombers}}"}}
