In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].\n\nThe Ho 229 V3 is the first jet in the \"Zerstörer\" tech tree of the Luftwaffe and currently comes before the [[G.91 R/3]]. Ironically, it goes against much of the doctrine set by the previous planes, favouring speed and manoeuvrability over armament and durability.\n\nSomething that will immediately stand out with the Ho 229 V3 is how incredibly manoeuvrable it is compared to most other jet fighters. The Ho 229 V3 can almost quite literally turn on a dime and can even in some circumstances out-turn late super props such as the [[P-51H-5-NA|P-51H]] if manoeuvred correctly. However, if its manoeuvrability is used to its full extent, it also causes the plane to bleed speed at a crippling rate, making a sustained turn fight impossible to win. As such, it is advised to use the Ho 229 V3 as a Boom & Zoom fighter in order to maintain airspeed and altitude. Remember that jet engines' efficiency is directly proportional to the IAS, due to the increased air intake, meaning the Ho 229 V3 will be accelerating very slowly between 0-500 km/h, but beyond will be able to outrun any propeller-driven aircraft.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Go for ammunition, engine and compressor upgrades first.\n\nAfter that, any upgrade is equally good. Weapon upgrades can wait, as the Mk 103 is the best gun in-game, with high accuracy and long bursts stock. The belts also shouldn't be a priority unless using the Ho 229 as an attacker. In that case, the \"Armoured targets\" belt is very useful against tanks & light pillboxes.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:FighterImage_Ho-229Vunknown.jpg|thumbnail|Horten 229 Version 3 with its wings attached by the USAF in 1950.]]\nThe Horten 229 flying wing is a dogfighter, heavy-fighter, or even an attacker.\n\nIts single wing design allows for amazing  manoeuvrability despite its weight of up to 8 tonnes, when equipped with full fuel load. This is, however, the Horten's literal downfall; the weight. Its acceleration is awful, even for jets. But the energy retention is great and climb acceptable. With that in mind rule number one of jet battle comes into play: do not turnfight! The 229 will tempt anyone though. The low wing loading for a jet and even some piston planes allows for tight turning circles. Being heavy also allows to keep that velocity well in the initial turns, but with the inability to regain that speed afterwards... leads to a flaming wreck thanks to an opportunistic enemy. The classic dogfight is thus only for emergency situations!\n\nAs a fighter, stick with Boom & Zoom, in which the Ho 229's heavy weight is of assistance in zoom climbs. However, it will also dampen the Horten's starting acceleration in a dive, making out diving an enemy difficult. The bad roll rate makes it hard to get some shots on target, But watch out! Don't pull too hard on the elevator to get that shot, or the Horten will lose much speed (which cannot be regained quickly) or rarely, lose a wing.\n\nThe heavy fighter role equals the fighter one in every aspect, just that the targets are usually bombers. Stay fast, and try to get shots off in head-ons, or in slight diving turns from the bomber's six (tail), to make it difficult for the defensive gunners to hit the Ho 229.\n\nThe attacker role is a dangerous one. The Ho 229 will have to fly slow, in order to have time to properly aim, hit & evade trees. While all of these aren't difficult in the Horten 229 V3, it leaves the plane in a dangerous spot: low and without speed. Both are vital though for the sluggish plane. In this role, be sure to have good escort fighters, as enemies can come at any time in jet combat.\n\nOnce the Horten is fully upgraded, or at least the performance parts are, one detail to notice is that the wings won't rip so easily like before, but the Ho 229 still has to turn cautiously, because it is still a wooden plane after all.\n\nPerhaps the most dangerous enemy of the Horten 229 is the F-84 Thunderjet. Since the Thunderjet gets an air spawn it already has all the energy it needs to get around the map quickly. There are occasions when players spawn in late, only to be strafed by an F-84 Thunderjet on the runway. The Ho-229 is decent at accelerating once up to about 550 km/h, past that point, the Ho 229 becomes a V2 rocket in terms of acceleration until about ~750-800 km/h, then there will be a hard time accelerating again.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Because jet engines of the time had poor efficiency, the Horten Brothers thought putting them in a flying wing, which had reduced drag, was the solution.\n\nThe Horten Brothers proposed their project for a bomber, Ho IX, but the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) thought the plane would be better as a jet fighter than a long range bomber and requested that two MK 103 cannons were mounted. The result was the prototype Ho 229.\n\nOnly one example of a Ho 229 V3 was in final phase of assembly at the end of the war, and sent on to the United States by the allies.\n\nThe Ho 229 had three prototypes before the facility was overrun.\n[[File:FighterImage_Draeger suit from the side.jpeg|thumb|right|Pilot with Draeger suit in Ho 229]]\n\n# '''V1''' was a glider to test the design.\n# '''V2''' was a down-scaled prototype fitted with the Jumo 004B.\n# '''V3''' was a testbed for serial production, it was however not completely finished when the US Army arrived.\n\nOriginally the V3 was intended to have the Jumo 004C jet engines, these weren't ready though and the Me 262 A's 004B was installed. <!--(--~~~~14:12, 22 September 2014 (UTC) B-2, or B-4?).-->\nThe final production version would have had the ability to load bombs, switch the main armament to four [[MK 108 (30 mm)|MK 108]] and the pilots were to be equipped with the Draeger pressure suit ([[G-Suit]]).\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=go229_v3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|INb9VjLxKf0|'''Most unusual aircraft''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 5:54 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|hNfRQMZUMQg|'''The Shooting Range #195''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:05 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|80rCNzTtk9w|'''{{PAGENAME}} Gameplay''' - ''PhlyDaily''|1iGO6MPhC_A|'''{{PAGENAME}} - Gameplay and Tips''' - ''WhooptieDo''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/189462-horten-ho-229-v3/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Gothaer}}\n{{Germany jet aircraft}}"}}
