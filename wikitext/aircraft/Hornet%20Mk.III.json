Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nFor pilots who loved the Mosquito, the Hornet is a dream come true.\n\nAs a descendant of the [[Mosquito FB Mk VI]], it maintains many similarities to its older brother, namely an all-wooden construction and the iconic de Havilland tail design. However, the Hornet somehow managed to improve on the already excellent Mosquito platform, increasing speed, manoeuvrability and armament while reducing overall aircraft proportions. From takeoff and into its flight, the Hornet is an overall smooth operator with brutal speed, insane climb rate, and excellent manoeuvrability, especially for a twin-engined fighter. However, it's still a twin-engined fighter which means it can still be outmanoeuvred by most single-engined opponents which it faces, namely Bf 109s and most Italian fighter aircraft.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,791 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nBeing a descendant of the legendary [[Mosquito FB Mk VI|Mosquito]], one should expect a similar playstyle with the Hornet. However, due to the vastly improved performance, the aircraft can perform amicably in most situations it is thrown in.\n\n'''Fighter''': The Hornet does very well in a dogfighting situation for a heavy fighter. It can use its powerful quad [[Hispano Mk.V (20 mm)|Hispano Mk.Vs]] to shred any fighter which falls within its gun sights. The incredible top speed and acceleration/climb rate allow it to gain and maintain energy advantages over most of its competition. From there the Hornet can pick and choose when to attack. Since you cannot fall back on manoeuvrability to shake enemy fighters from your six, playing the Hornet requires good situational awareness and a general understanding of the enemies' top speed, climb rate, and energy, as you must prevent enemy fighters from catching you if you want to stay alive. Never assume you can outmanoeuvre an enemy plane, so always rely on speed and altitude to stay alive. While flying the Hornet can often require periods of extending/increasing your energy advantage before re-engaging, it is important to stay aggressive. Support your teammates whenever you can (clearing enemies from their six, dragging enemies away so they can focus on a single enemy, etc.) or you may soon find yourself alone versus multiple enemy fighters, a situation even the powerful Hornet can struggle in. The Hornet's ability to swoop in, make a high-speed guns pass, then extend away safely vs everything with a propeller can make it a valuable addition to any team. Even if it can't get guns on target, the enemy has to dodge the Hornet and this provides opportunities for more nimble allies to secure easy kills.\n\nHowever, one should take note that most single-engined fighters (and even some medium bombers) will turn circles around the Hornet, so turn-fighting should be avoided whenever possible. Use the Hornet's high speed, climb rate, and energy retention to stay safe from enemy guns until opportunities to attack present themselves, because the Hornet will not be winning many turnfights. Pretty much any plane with forward-facing guns can cut inside the Hornet's turning radius at most speeds, so never enter 1-circle turnfights. The Hornet can however, win prolonged rate fights vs other poor turners with significantly less engine power (such as Do 335s), as the massive amount of power it generates allows it to maintain speed throughout turns even with the combat/takeoff flaps deployed. This is generally not the best way to fly the hornet, even when the rare opportunity to turnfight presents itself, as a low and slow Hornet is extremely vulnerable to anything that finds it.\n\nHigh speed and great climb rate coupled with its amazing armament make the Hornet an extremely potent user of the Boom & Zoom fighting doctrine. Always attempt to maintain an energy and altitude advantage versus the enemy aircraft and avoid tunnel vision which means, be aware of the aircraft around you. Tunnel vision prevents you from seeing an enemy aircraft get the drop on you until its too late and either tracer fire is whizzing past or the Hornet's engine is on fire.\n\n'''Ground Attacker:''' When upgraded, the Hornet can load 4 AP or RP-3 rockets and two 1,000 lb bombs. This, combined with the performance of the Hornet and power of the Hispanos allow it to be an amazing ground attacker that can shred any ground target in sight. The AP rockets are your best bet when it comes to ground attack, as they are more accurate than the RP-3s, fly faster, impact harder and penetrate more armour. However, when destroying light targets, the RP-3s are better due to the increased explosive filler.\n\n'''Bomber Hunter''': Due to its amazing performance, powerful armament and air defence fighter spawn point, the Hornet can make for a powerful interceptor when played carefully. Climb to bomber altitudes (4,000 metres and up) and begin prowling for a target. When attacking bombers, the worst angle of attack is from the rear, typically most bombers have their heaviest armament here, not to mention bullet impact is harder (especially from .50 calibre machine guns and 20 mm cannons) as the aircraft is flying towards a speeding bullet, increasing the damage it will do and the likelihood of being hit. Notable examples you can encounter at this rank are the [[B-29A-BN]], [[B-17G-60-VE]], [[PB4Y-2]], [[He 177 A-5]], [[G8N1]] and the premium [[Be-6]]. Remember, the body of the aircraft can soak up a lot of damage, instead dive from above or climb from below and aim for the wings, without engines or a wing, the bomber will fall like a rock. Attacking from oblique angles makes it difficult for the bomber gunners to acquire a target solution and causes them to traverse and fire which spreads out their bullet patterns making it more difficult to hit a speeding target.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Having built the extremely successful Mosquito multi-role fighter, the company wants to improve on the design to make a faster and longer ranged heavy fighter. The project was soon developed to meet the Air Ministry specification F.12/43, which called for a fast, long-range fighter that operated in the Far East, in fact, the design was drawn around the Hornet. The first prototype was a more streamlined, smaller Mosquito with more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. The wings were designed for adaptation for naval uses and could fold. Pilot comfort and stability had a very high priority. According to accounts by test pilots, the Hornet is easily capable of taking on single engine fighters. It entered Squadron service in mid-1946. However, it was rarely used as World War Two was drawing to a close. Instead, the plane saw combat operations during the Malayan Emergency and continued to serve the RAF until 1956.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=hornet_mk3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|SKeFUWKudoY|'''The Shooting Range #63''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 07:39 discusses the Hornet.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Mosquito FB Mk VI]]\n* [[Ki-83]]\n* [[He 219 A-7]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4913-development-de-havilland-hornet-deadly-sting-en|[Development] De Havilland Hornet: Deadly Sting!]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/378375-hornet-mkiii/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer deHavilland}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
