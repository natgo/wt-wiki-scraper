If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe plane is very heavy, which makes it nearly impossible to take out fighters (unless the fighters come to the Hs 129 B-2, see below), even most medium bombers are more manoeuvrable, however the plane is heavily armoured, so it can last a while even under heavy fire, even to such a degree that some planes run out of ammunition before taking out a Henschel. That combined with the heavy armament makes it ideal to attack B-17 formations, even though it requires time and effort to climb and match the speed of the formation. The armour around the cockpit makes it nearly immune to 7.92 mm rounds and could also fly with one engine, albeit with great difficulty. The planes incredibly stable flight behaviour makes aiming even for joystick pilots very easy and accurate thus not wasting too much ammunition.\n\nOnce the 30 mm additional gun with its impressive 100-round belt has been researched (the 37 mm with its smaller belt and low rate of fire should be avoided), the plane has very heavy firepower. In combination with the great stability and thus firing accuracy, this makes it an ideal heads-on fighter. With a bit of experience, it's relatively easy to finish off enemy fighters with one or two short bursts before they are even in range for the target indicator to appear. In situations where enemy planes coming at 0.5 to 1.0 km interval from the same direction, the Hs 129 B-2 can easily achieve triple or even quadruple air victories before needing to turn around for reloading.\n\n====Tactics====\n<!--Specific methods of play in different situations, label the methods with pros and cons (if possible) based on vehicle's performances (i.e. Me 262 playing as a fighter or anti-bomber)-->\nUsing the 30 mm MK 103, which can be unlocked as an additional armament option, the Hs 129 B-2 is capable of destroying most mission relevant ground targets. Tanks of all sorts, as well as light pillboxes, can be destroyed in up to three hits, provided armour piercing ammunition (HVAP-T) is unlocked. Thanks to the 100 rounds of ammunition available, this can make a single Hs 129 B-2 a game-changing aircraft. The same can be achieved using the BK 3.7, however, it is generally considered harder to use and thus not a viable option.\n\nThe Hs 129 B-2, however, does have major drawbacks. Its engines are weak which results in poor top speed, acceleration and climb rate. This, combined with the armour of nearly one-ton weight, makes it perform poorly in air combat and very vulnerable to attacks of enemy fighters. This, however, goes so far that sometimes enemy pilots underestimate the Hs 129 and overshoot it after a tight turn, which gives the Hs 129 B-2 pilot a moderate chance of defending itself.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n[[Yak-2 KABB]]: Do not think that the {{PAGENAME}} can confidently outmanoeuvre this plane just because it is twin-engined. The Yak-2 has an amazing turn rate for a heavy fighter, thus the {{PAGENAME}} must avoid turning with it, if not dogfighting with it in general. It bears a pair of ShVAK cannons that can easily damage vital parts like engine or cooling systems. It has green camo, greatly resembling an Me 410 but with an H-tail like a Bf 110's.\n\n[[ZSD63]]: A deadly enemy to face in Tank Realistic Battles. Though it is hard to identify specific SPAA vehicles on the ground (especially when they are shooting tracers at the plane), if a ZSD63 is identified, avoid it at all costs and '''do not''' attempt head-ons with it, ever. It can easily snap a wing off by causally putting a short burst in the {{PAGENAME}}'s flight path. Don't even get close to it unless it is occupied with another friendly or if the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with a bomb that it can use. The {{PAGENAME}}'s 30mm / 37mm cannons in the secondary armaments cannot effectively damage it as its hull is overall quite empty, causing your shells to do little to no damage. Some identifying features of the ZSD63 is its rather boxy and tall hull with a geometric turret sitting at the back, slightly similar to a Wirbelwind's. The firing manner is also distinctive: the sound and green tracers are very rapid, much like a buzz saw, but then it will remain silent for half a minute reloading. Note that an experienced ZSD player will hold its fire or shoot in single salvos with long halts between, making it look like that it's reloading. Armour piercing belt is recommended since their high penetration can tear through the ZSD's armour with ease and knock out its crews.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

However following the Soviet Annexation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in June - July 1940, the loss of Northern Transylvania to Hungary on 30 August 1940, and the loss of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria on 7 September 1940 the popularity of the Romanian government plummeted. This led to a series of government changes, followed by a Coup and the instalment of Ion Antonescu as the country's leader. Antonescu promptly got Romania to join the Tripartite Pact on 23 November, becoming allied with Nazi Germany.<ref name=\"Williamson1\">Williamson 2017 I</ref>\n\nBecoming allies with Nazi Germany gave Romania access to German aircraft. It is reported that Romania received Hs 129 A series aircraft.<ref name=\"Kretaner\">Kretaner n.d.</ref> The Hs 129 A was known for being extremely underpowered with its Argus As 410 engines, and B series aircraft were soon produced with more powerful Gnome-Rhône 14M radial engines. Romania received the latest Hs 129 B-2 version in June 1943; and they were put to use against Soviet forces on the Eastern Front<ref name=\"Joseph\">Joseph 2012</ref>. The Romanian Hs-129 B-2s typically carried a 30 mm cannon under the fuselage, and proved to be very effective in the ground attack role, reportedly \"bringing Soviet tank and infantry attacks to a halt time and again\".<ref name=\"Joseph\" /> On 23 August 1944 after Romania had been suffering heavy losses against the advancing Soviet forces King Michael I of Romania ordered Antonescu to surrender. When Antonescu refused the king had him arrested and declared war on Nazi Germany, joining the Soviet advance.<ref name=\"Williamson2\">Williamson 2017 II</ref> It is unclear if the Hs 129s were used against Germany.\n\nOne Romanian ace to fly the Hs 129 was Teodor Zăbavă, who achieved four air-to-air kills in his Hs 129 (and more in his IAR 80). One kill occurred on 25 October 1943 against a Soviet Yak fighter.<ref name=\"Bernad\">Bernad 2012</ref>\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe German Henschel Hs-129 was a single-seater twin-engine attack aircraft built for combat with tanks.\n\nFor the designers of the Henschel firm, which specialized in the manufacture of armoured vehicles for the Army, the most difficult challenge was aircraft survivability. They sought to protect the pilot and the most vulnerable components of the aircraft. Their desire to keep mass as low as possible led them to build a cockpit encased in 75 millimeters of glass. The design was very cramped and poorly regarded. Among other inconveniences were the tiny control panel and short control stick.\n\nDuring flight testing, it was found that the aircraft could not dive, since any angle greater than 30 degrees resulted in the pilot being unable to control the aircraft. In addition, it was found that the Hs-129 could not fly well on one engine. This fact, combined with the reasoning that the plane could land using the other engine should its partner fail, led to the plane's twin-engine design.\n\nDespite the plane's shortcomings, the Luftwaffe desperately needed aircraft for the assault of 1940, and in the winter of 1940, Henschel received an order for a series of Hs-129 planes. With the occupation of France, a large number of Gnome-Rhone 14M engines were confiscated, each running at 700 hp. Experiments with installing more powerful (albeit unreliable) engines led to the creation of the Hs-129 B, which had superior specs to the original Hs-129 and could return all the way to base if forced to fly with only one engine.\n\nSerial production of the Hs-129 B-1 began in 1941, and May of the following year saw the launch of the modified Hs-129 B-2, which had a modified fuel system (along with several other minor changes).\n\nAll in all, 878 Hs-129s were produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=hs-129b-2_romania Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/80788-henschel-hs-129-b-2/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n===References===\n\n;Citations\n<references />\n\n;Bibliography\n\n* Bernad, D.
