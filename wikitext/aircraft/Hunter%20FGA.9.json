Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.93 \"Shark Attack\"]] as a premium pack, and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/7417-shop-war-thunder-birthday-sale-in-gaijin-net-store-en|9th Anniversary Sale]]. It was made available briefly to purchase with Golden Eagles {{ge}} during the [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/552122-zimbabwe-independence-day/ 2022 \"Zimbabwe Independence Day\"]\n\nThe FGA.9 is a fighter aircraft which was used primarily by the Rhodesian Air Force for ground attack purposes, and can carry a large payload for close air support. It also excels in air-to-air combat thanks to two [[AIM-9E Sidewinder]] missiles, and its high speed and energy retention for the battle rating.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nAlthough without an afterburner, this aircraft will out-accelerate almost all aircraft at its battle rating. The [[MiG-15bis (Germany)|▀MiG-15]] bis and [[MiG-17AS]] will out-accelerate you on the runway, but from about 400-1,000 km/h you can pretty much outrun everything, even [[Shenyang F-5]]s, [[F-86K (France)|F86K]]s and [[F-100D|F100]]s all with afterburners. The aircraft has one of the best acceleration rates for a non-afterburning jet in the game, beaten by the Etendard IVM and then the Yak-38/38M. It also has extremely good top end speed for its battle rating. Be warned the aircraft is a brick(especially at lower speeds) so most aircraft will out-turn you. Turning is advised only against larger aircraft like [[F-4 Phantom II (Family)|F-4 Phantoms]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nThe FGA.9 is quite survivable with a robust airframe due to it being primarily intended for ground attacking or close air support. It may take a few hits from enemy cannon fire and still survive, and also stay flying with critical components (wing, engine, etc.) damaged long enough to return to base. However, don't expect the FGA.9 to soak up 30 mm DEFA or other ADEN armed aircraft. Head-on attacks are recommended, albeit from further away than other aircraft (about 2.5/2km away and pull off) due to closure rates and the aircraft being a brick so you have to pull off earlier than normal. Do not commit fully to a head-on attack, as your ADEN cannon muzzle velocity is slower than most other guns. Do not head-on aircraft .50cal, like F-86s as they will ruin you before your shots even get anywhere near their aircraft. The placement of the cannons also makes head-on attacks tricky.\n\nThe only armour on the aircraft are a 64 mm bullet proof glass in front of the pilot, with a 12.7 mm steel plate behind the pilot.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nSide rush and burst climb, then enter the main cluster of aircraft in the middle (ideally with a height advantage). Your AIM-9Es (if you choose to bring them into battle) will quickly dispatch any enemies at a low energy state (hopefully distracted by fighting someone else). Use your superior speed in the cluster and launch your ordnance then zoom back up (the [[Boom & Zoom]] strategy). When you have expended your missiles, use your 30 mm ADENs as they are VERY destructive and typically only one shell is enough to critically damage or destroy any aircraft they come in contact with.\n\nIf up-tiered into fighting top-rank fighter jets, planes such as the [[MiG-21SMT]] / [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MF]] , [[F-4E Phantom II|F-4E]]/[[F-4EJ Phantom II|EJ]]/[[Phantom FGR.2|FGR]] Phantoms will ruin the {{PAGENAME}} due to good turn rate (in the MiG's case) and very high speeds - they are problematic as the {{PAGENAME}} has a non-afterburning engine, so they will out-accelerate you easily, while the [[R-60M]]/[[AIM-9J Sidewinder|AIM-9J]]/[[AIM-7D Sparrow|AIM-7]]/[[Matra R550 Magic 1|R550 Magic]] missiles will easily out-pull the Hunter every time if they acquire a strong lock and send you back to the hangar. The only way to get a shot against the higher BR jets is to dive on them while they are distracted or fighting someone else and launch a missile at them.\n\n===Radars===\n<!--{{main|AN/APG-30}}-->\nThe Hunter FGA.9 is equipped with an AN/APG-30 rangefinding radar, located in the nose of the aircraft.\nIt will automatically detect other planes within the scanning area and display the range to the closest target. It is linked with a gyro gunsight and can help with aiming at close range.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | AN/APG-30 - Rangefinding radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The maximum range at which a target can be tracked}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The range below which targets cannot be tracked by the radar}}\n! {{Annotation|Azimuth Tracking<br/>Angle|How far to each side the radar can track a target}}\n! {{Annotation|Elevation Tracking<br/>Angle|How far up and down the radar can track a target}}\n|-\n| 2,750 m || 300 m || ±9° || ±9°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

At the time, the Venom was still in use as a Close Air Support aircraft both in South East Asia and the Middle East; especially in the Aden Emergency it was intensely used, and as a result, a replacement was urgently required. In 1958 the Royal Air Force started the Venom Replacement Evaluation Trials (VRET), selecting the Royal Air Force bases of RAF Khormaksar (Aden) with its long paved runway, and RAF Riyan (Quaiti State, Eastern Aden Protectorate) with its unhardened airstrip as trials bases.\n\nFor the VRET, three types were selected: the Hunting Jet Provost T.3; the Folland Gnat F.1; and last but not least, the Hawker [[Hunter F.6]]. Before the trials began, the Folland Gnat was considered the forerunner, while the Hawker Hunter was initially not even considered for the trials, as the type was thought to be uneconomical for use in the Middle East, however, this decision was overturned after intense lobbying by Hawker. Early on during the trials, it became clear that the Hunting Jet Provost was not able to fulfil any of the requirements set by the trials, and while the type would go on to be developed into the successful BAC Strikemaster, it was eliminated from the contest. The trials had become a straight contest between the Hunter and the Gnat.\n\nEarly on, the Folland appeared to be a clear favourite: above 40,000 ft it was more manoeuvrable than the Hunter, and its diminutive size made it a difficult target to spot and aim at. Additionally, it required only a minimum of external equipment to operate it from unprepared airstrips. However, the diminutive size of the Gnat also worked in its disadvantage: its relative short landing gear gave the aircraft unpleasant characteristics on unpaved airstrips, and its relatively low-set exhaust damaged the runway surface. However, the main problem for the Gnat was that it was unable to meet range requirements. Fully loaded for combat it had a range of 188 nm, which fell short of the 250 nm requirement set up in the VRET; with external tanks, its maximum ferry range was 673 nm, which was insufficient to ferry it between the Royal Air Force's main Middle East Air Force bases. At the end of the trials, the Hunter came out as the winner on all points except agility above 40,000 ft.\n\nFollowing the trials, conversion work was started to bring the Hunter F.6 up to full ground attack standard, the FGA.9 (for Fighter, Ground Attack). The wing spars were restressed and strengthened, a brake chute was added in a housing above the exhaust for use on unprepared airstrips, the flight controls were adjusted to give a better response at low altitude, and the oxygen supply was increased; as the FGA.9 was primarily intended for use in the Middle East, the aircraft were also given a tropicalised refrigeration and ventilation system. New drop tanks were designed for the inner wing hardpoints, capable of carrying 230 gallons (instead of the 100-gallon drop tanks in use up to then); as they were larger, a cut-out was made in the flaps so they could be extended while carrying the new tanks. Initially, these tanks were fixed and intended for ferry use only, but gradually they were redesigned so they could be jettisonable and used in combat. The first Hunter FGA.9 made its maiden flight on July 3rd 1959. The initial batch was built to 'interim' FGA.9 with an Avon 203 which provided 10,000 lb thrust; the production variant was equipped with an Avon 207 which provided 10,050 lb thrust.\n\nAround the time the Hunter FGA.9 started entering RAF service in 1960, the Hunter F.6 was considered obsolete as a day fighter with the impending service entry of the English Electric Lightning. As a result, many Hunter F.6 airframes were taken back by Hunter for a rebuild to the FGA.9 standard. In all, 144 Hunter F.6s were rebuild to FGA.9 standard. A dedicated reconnaissance variant was also developed out of the FGA.9: the FR.10 had the same capabilities as the FGA.9, except for the adjusted flight controls, its main difference being a set of reconnaissance cameras in a new nose.\n\nIn Royal Air Force service, the Hunter FGA.9 was first deployed in Aden in 1960, where it replaced the obsolete Venom; it was used during the Radfan Emergency to attack insurgent forces. During the Borneo Confrontation of 1963-1966, RAF Hunter FGA.9s were used in counter-insurgency operations. The withdrawal from the Royal Air Force from its former protectorates in the late 1960s saw the need for these ground-attack Hunters disappear; the last frontline RAF Hunter FGA.9 unit was disbanded in 1971, however, the type remained in RAF service as an advanced trainer until the 1980s, with trainer variants remaining in RAF service until the early 1990s.\n\nThe Hunter FGA.9 variant also became the basis of numerous close air support variants intended for export. This was partly possible due to the disbanding of numerous RAF day fighter units following the 1957 Defence White Paper, and partly due to the early retirement of the Hawker Hunter F.6 in Belgian (1963) and Dutch (1968) service. This released several hundreds of Hunter F.6 airframes which could be rebuilt to FGA standard. Dedicated 'national' variants were built for India (FGA.56), Kuwait (FGA.57), Switzerland (F.58A), Iraq (FGA.59), Lebanon (FGA.70), Chile (FGA.71), Jordan (FGA.73), Singapore (FGA.75), Abu Dhabi (FGA.76), Qatar (FGA.78) and Kenya (FGA.80). Additionally, numerous ex-Royal Air Force FGA.9 airframes were refurbished by Hunter for export.\n\nIn foreign service, the Hawker Hunter had a considerably long life. It was relatively easy to maintain type, which could be deployed quickly if needed. In the absence of aerial threats, it was an excellent ground attack aircraft, making it suited for low-intensity conflict and counter-insurgency operations. Many aircraft were locally modified to carry a wide variety of ordnance: some air forces such as those of Switzerland and Singapore modified theirs to carry the AIM-9 Sidewinder; in their ultimate guise, Swiss Air Force Hunters were even capable of firing the AGM-65 Maverick. Most aircraft were withdrawn from frontline service in the 1990s, with Switzerland being the last Western nation to withdraw the type from frontline service in 1994. The Indian Air Force was the last major user of the type, withdrawing the last of its Hunters in 2000; the last nation to withdraw the Hunter from frontline military service was Lebanon, retiring the Hunter in 2014. Even so, a handful of Hunters remain in limited military service: as of 2019, ATAC in the United States, Apache Aviation in France, Hawker Hunter Aviation in the UK and Lortie Aviation in Canada operate a number of civilianised Hawker Hunters under government military contracts to provide high-speed aerial threat simulation, mission support training and trials support services.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=hunter_f9_rhodesia Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|9ivnMchdhqE|'''Fighter Theory: The Premium Hunter FGA.9''' - ''Sako Sniper''|zU7Nfa-Aqso|'''Should You Buy The Hunter FGA. 9?''' - ''Sako Sniper''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* Hawker [[Sea Hawk FGA.6|Sea Hawk]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Dassault [[Super Mystere B2|Super Mystère]]\n* Mikoyan [[MiG-17]]\n* North American [[F-100D|F-100]] Super Sabre\n* North American [[FJ-4B]] Fury\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Hawker}}\n{{Britain jet aircraft}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
