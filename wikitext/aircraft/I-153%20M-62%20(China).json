Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.-->\n\nThe Chinese I-153 M-62 Chaika has a really good turn radius thanks to retractable landing gear, that increases aerodynamics. This plane's battle rating makes it a match against early Bf 109s and other single-wing fighters. This allows the I-52 M-62 to outturn planes at its battle rating. The plane does not come without its downsides, for example other planes at this battle rating can go faster than this plane, which you might have a difficult time keeping up with other fighters.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,850 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nBeing a biplane, the aircraft is capable of enduring some rifle-calibre fire in combat, in some cases it will be able to keep flying after some hits from larger calibres. However, at its battle ratting, it will commonly encounter 12.7 mm machine guns and 20 mm cannons of which will not be kind to its airframe. These weapons will easily inflict critical damage onto the aircraft with only a few clean hits, due to this its best to maintain good awareness and use the aircraft's highly competitive manoeuvrability to avoid being hit by enemy fire.\n\nThe Chaika features a large 8 mm steel plate behind the pilot this will provide some protection against smaller calibres when being attacked from behind, although it will not offer much protection against 12.7 mm and 20 mm weapons.\n\n* 8 mm steel: behind pilot\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|FAB-50 (50 kg)|RS-82|RBS-82}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* Without load\n* 4 x 50 kg FAB-50 bombs (200 kg total)\n* 8 x RS-82 rockets\n* 8 x RBS-82 rockets\n\nThe weapons on the Chaika do offer a fair bit of flexibility, the four 7.62 mm Machine guns hold between 500-750 rounds of ammunition per gun with a fire rate of 1,800 rounds per minute, in addition all 4 guns are mounted in the nose of the aircraft and fire through the propeller. Being mounted so close to the centreline of the aircraft simplifies aiming with gun targeting distance being much less critical, the guns being so close also give a rather focused impact point something of which can be devastating if shots are hitting the target. \n\nIn addition to its guns, the I-153 can use both bombs and rockets, a set of 4 x 50 kg FAB-50 bombs can be carried under the wings, each bomb holds 26.35 kg of explosive mass which at this battle rating will be enough to critically damage or destroy ground targets with a fairly accurate drop, the aircraft will be able to carry out 2 bombing runs as the bombs drop in pairs, with the outer pair dropping first and then the inner pair. \n\nThere are two rocket types available to the Chaika and in both cases 8 can be carried under the wings. The first type is the RS-82, a HE rocket with 360 g of explosive mass and 10 mm of penetration, these are trumped by the RBS-82. The RBS-82 is essentially a rocket-propelled APHE Round as it can penetrate up too 60 mm of armour and has 480 g of explosive mass so a solid hit is almost guaranteed to reward you with a kill, with 4 paired firings the RBS-82s make the I-153 M-62 a rather effective aircraft for ground battles at its battle rating.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!--''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->\n[[File:China I-153 M-62 Wiki Image 5.jpg|thumb|The Cockpit of the I-153.]]\nThe I-153 can be used in turnfighting, bomber intercepting and ground-pounding. It is excellent in turning tightly and continuously, and it has lovely low-speed handling and a low stall speed (unlike the I-16), making it a great starter plane for simulator battles. However it does have its drawbacks: the rather big nose blocks the visibility a lot, offering very poor over-the-nose visibility which is a disadvantage in a turn fight, because when leading a shot the enemy will always get obstructed by the engine, making the player guess the shot. Also, its upper wings will get in the way when you look aside.  \n\nNote: it is recommended to set the convergence within 300 m, with vertical convergence on, because the majority of turn fights happen at that range or closer.\n\nBefore engaging a fight, it is better to have an altitude advantage first. When approaching the fight try to figure out which is your teammate and which is the enemy, to avoid going for a second pass, as the energy retention of the I-153 is rather slow. Also, pick your target carefully. For easier aiming, you want to go for those less-manoeuvrable twin-engine aircraft like [[Ju 88 (Family)|Ju 88]] or [[Ki-45 (Family)|Ki-45]], or bombers if there are any. Given the bad forward visibility of the I-153, these are the best options as they are quite slow and sluggish, and are a bigger target to hit. However getting hits on them doesn't mean good damage, so you must be patient. When dealing with fighters, it is way harder to aim. The elevator control of the I-153 is extremely sensitive, giving it good manoeuvrability, but at the same time, bad handling. The I-153 will respond in a very fast turn upon moving your stick/mouse by a little bit, which makes tracking nimble planes quite hard. But once you get used to it, try to lure every enemy into a turn fight, as that is where the I-153 shines. Quite a bit of bullets are required to effectively damage the enemy so you must be patient. If you find an enemy at your 6, utilise your great roll rate to do defensive manoeuvres like scissors to make them overshoot. Or you can simply do tight turns, most monoplanes won't be able to cut inside your turn and they might disengage.\n\nIf you are not very experienced in simulator battles, you can also go for even bigger targets (bombers) for easier aiming. However, you want to be more careful when hunting bombers, since with the Sim control (whether it be mouse joystick or a real stick) the plane will manoeuvre much more gently, making itself a great target for the bomber's gunners. Do not follow behind a bomber's 6 unless you are sure that its tail gunners are unconscious. Chasing behind a bomber makes yourself stationary for the tail gunners, and you will be showered with bullets. Your big radial engine will usually get damaged. Instead, before attacking, get an altitude advantage over the bomber by flying around 2 km above it. The bomber should only fill up about 1/6 of your gunsight. The best position for an attack is at the bomber's high 6 so you can adjust the lead much easier. Dive at the bomber, but not directly at it, try to predict where you two will crash by imagining yourself like a missile, that's where you should aim at (deflection shooting). To maximise the damage it is better to aim for their wings and engines, as the fuselage usually soaks up quite some bullets. Only fire when the bomber passes in front of your guns. This short window might seem inadequate to do anything, but with an accurate burst on the engine, the 4 MG can at least damage it. With an engine damaged most bombers cannot go far.\n\nGround pounding ability is average as there is only light bombs and rockets. The 8 rockets, with accurate aiming, can destroy 4 targets, whether them be tanks or pillboxes. The small 50 kg bombs can be used on light pillboxes. Once the suspended armaments are gone, the 4 MG are good for killing soft targets like trucks, artillery and AA cars.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n[[Ki-27 otsu|Ki-27]], [[N1K1]], [[He 51 (Family)|He 51]], [[Gladiator (Family)|Gladiator]], etc. - Those commonly seen planes are equally good at turn fights and will be a hard target to down since they are very small and agile. To deal with them you need to practice leading and deflection shots, plus manoeuvres like barrel rolls and scissors. They still need plenty of bullets to get damaged, so these kind of targets are the hardest to kill and requires great skills from the player.\n\n[[Do 17 Z-2|Do 17 Z]] - This early twin-engine plane always shows up as an AI-controlled recon aircraft that you have to down, which is a piece of good news as AI won't manoeuvre aggressively. However, this plane is extremely durable for the I-153's weak MGs. When it shows up as an AI, deflection shots are not recommended as the small shooting windows really does nothing. Instead, try disabling its 2 gunners first, then just sit behind it and burst on its wings and engines. When attacking the gunners try to not get your engine damaged by pulling evasive manoeuvres as soon as the bullets come close, since the Do 17 can outrun the I-153 in a level flight.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Initial support was with [[I-15bis|I-15]] biplanes, but as the Japanese introduced the superior [[Ki-27 otsu|Nakajima Ki-27]] the Soviets moved to counter the new threat. \n\nWith the Polikarpov I-15bis (second version) becoming obsolete, the Soviet military felt it was too early to abandon biplanes so they approved of an update proposed by Polikarpov. The resulting I-15, 3rd version, or [[I-153 M-62|I-153 Chaika]] (Russian Чайка, \"Seagull\") was, in short, an unmitigated success. Mounting a more powerful Shvetsov M-62 engine and retractable wheels (unusual for a biplane), it gained an almost 100 km/h speed advantage over its older sibling. In addition, the four slow firing PV-1 machine guns were replaced with the ShKAS machine gun which fired some 2.3 times faster, making its firepower competitive with more modern fighters of the period; however, its dominance was short lived.\n\nToo late to see service in the Spanish Civil War, the Chaika's baptism of fire was in Northern China where it proved its mettle versus the latest Japanese design, even proving to be better than the [[I-16 (Family)|I-16]]. Although well loved by crews for its sublime combat performance, Japanese forces developed effective counter tactics and eventually it could no longer meet future performance requirements, so retirement came fast. In the end, speed was clearly more important than manoeuvrability. \n\nThe Battles of Khalkhin Gol was the one major conflict where the I-153 was extensively used against the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. While the results were practically a tie with no change to borders, both sides lost many men and equipment scattered across the desolate lands of the Mongolian-Chinese border. Decades later, a New Zealand airplane collector recovered a number of I-15s and I-153s from the battleground and restored several of them to flying condition, now in museums around the world.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=i-153_m62_china Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/2768--en|[Vehicle Profile] Polikarpov I-153]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Polikarpov}}\n{{China fighters}}"}}
