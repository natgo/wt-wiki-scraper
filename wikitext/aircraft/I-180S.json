Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nYou can climb to about 4,000-5,000 m of altitude at the beginning of the battle and use Boom & Zoom tactic to get rid of some low-altitude enemies first. If there are any enemies above or at the same altitude as you, it is recommended to attempt to drag them into a dogfight. Head-on attacks are ill-advised against heavily armed and armoured planes such as the [[F4U (Family)|F4U Corsair]], [[P-40 (Family)|P-40 Warhawk]], and [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]] because the I-180S lacks armour around many critical components, including the pilot and fuel tank. The I-180S's armament seems to push the nose up a small amount, but good aim prevents this from being that much of an issue.\n\nAlthough the I-180S is fairly manoeuvrable, there are some aircraft which can easily outturn it such as the British [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]] and Japanese [[A6M (Family)|A6M Zero]]. Both of these fighter types have an excellent turn rate which means that dogfighting, even against a mediocre pilot, will most likely result in them getting on your tail. A recommended strategy to combat these types is to try to gain an altitude advantage or do a head-on with a quick snap-turn to out-run them and return for another pass.\n\nIn RB/SB modes, the I-180S has a nasty habit of entering stalls at low speeds, especially when turnfighting with manual rudder and elevator controls - at which point, it falls like a rock for a few hundred metres. Daring pilots may be able to use this to their advantage to throw off pursuing planes, but be careful not to end up crashing.  \n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nDevelopment of the I-180 began in 1938, with the Polikarpov design bureau starting work on creating a new aircraft to meet the requirements of the Soviet Air Force at the time. In order to do so, engineers decided to base the new machine on a modified I-16 design and to install a more powerful radial engine. As a result, the I-180 was created. However, development and testing of prototypes was plagued with numerous issues, including many accidents. This, coupled with the arrival of new Soviet fighter designs quickly cast a shadow on the I-180 project which ultimately led to the project being cancelled by the end of 1940. Prior to the cancellation, a production version of the machine - the I-180S was built but only in very limited numbers. In total, around 13 I-180s were built, including prototypes, but none saw any active service.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6136-development-i-180s-sky-acrobat-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=i_180 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:I-180S WTWallpaper 001.jpg\nFile:I-180S WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:I-180S WTWallpaper 003.jpg\nFile:I-180S WTWallpaper 004.jpg\nFile:I-180S WTWallpaper 005.jpg\nFile:I-180S WTWallpaper 006.jpg\nFile:I180s.png|The standard livery is mainly red, with some items in shiny silver.\nFile:I180s-summer.png|Summer livery, with red stars on the classic Soviet green and blue camouflage.\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|yWWFv8qY5rQ|'''Battlefield Engineer: all new vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 0:37 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|M8mN2rWvHbw|'''Is THIS the MOST FUN Plane? {{PAGENAME}} Review''' - ''Jengar''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6136-development-i-180s-sky-acrobat-en|[Devblog] I-180S: Sky Acrobat]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/453805-i-180/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Polikarpov}}\n{{USSR fighters}}\n{{USSR premium aircraft}}"}}
