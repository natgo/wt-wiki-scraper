It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]].\n\nAn attacker aircraft of identical make to the [[IL-10 (1946)|Soviet version]], the IL-10 (1946) provides the substantial ability for ground attack with its ordnance and four 23 mm autocannons. A gunner with an autocannon armament as well at the rear also can help provide powerful deterrence to any fighters attempting to follow the IL-10 (1946).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* 6 mm Steel - Propeller hub plate\n* 8 mm Steel - Engine surround plating\n* 6 mm Steel - Under cockpit plate, under gunner plate, under the rear gun plate, the canopy frame plate\n* 8.5 mm Steel - Rear gunner plate\n* 8 mm Steel - Headrest plate between pilot/gunner\n* 64 mm Bulletproof glass - Front canopy\n\nThe Il-10 (1946) is a very well-defended plane. It has armour protection all throughout the front half of the fuselage and a bulletproof glass in front of the pilot. These armour can protect against most rifle-calibre rounds and maybe even some autocannon rounds. The construction is also robust, with all the modules centred into the armoured portion of the fuselage. The more likely way an IL-10 (1946) will be shot down is when the enemy shoots apart the plane's wings, tail, or their respective control surfaces.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nAll priority in the modification unlocks should go into Flight Performance and Survivability. The Offensive 23 mm module can wait as it unlocks no new rounds for the IL-10 (1946) aside from the new belt arrangements. By the Tier III and IV modules, some considerations can be made for the turret and rocket modification depending on the player's preferences. The turret module can allow for more armour-penetrating rounds to be used against tailing fighters, or a higher concentration of HEF ammunition. The rockets can bring powerful high-explosive projectiles onto ground targets, but the IL-10 (1946) can only carry four rockets total, so they will not offer as much ground attack opportunities as the 23 mm autocannons, though they are more reliable to destroy tanks with.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|B-20E (20 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 20 mm B-20E cannon, dorsal turret (150 rpg)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nNS-23 cannons are not capable of destroying medium or light tanks even with AP ammunition. This severely hinders the aircraft's ground attack capabilities, so it is best utilized as a multi-purpose aircraft similar to the [[B7A2|B7A2 Ryusei]]. However, it is worth noting that this aircraft wields the ability to carry a varied payload of both bombs and rockets. With proper aim, it is possible to destroy heavy tanks albeit very difficult as there is no bombing reticule. The \"air targets\" belt for the 23 mm cannons have the ability to demolish soft ground targets such as armoured cars and AAA units, but also retains the ability to destroy fighters and bombers alike with only a handful of rounds. Therefore, it can be beneficial to first attack the enemy's light defences and then if a teammate has been forced to a lower altitude by a pursuer, attempting to alleviate the stress of that pilot can be beneficial. Like the [[La-9]], the IL-10 (1946) has the ability to fire two of its 23 mm cannons instead of four as the ammunition pools are separate. A good strategy is to use one set of 23 mm belts for attacking ground targets, and the other for destroying enemy aircraft.\n\nIf found in a sticky situation, the IL-10 (1946) pilot may choose to call for help or to \"roll the dice\" and use the 20 mm tail cannon. While it is effective, hitting the enemy at longer distances can be very difficult, especially without the \"new 20 mm cannon (turret)\" module upgrade. It is best to lure an enemy by turning and evading their fire and then lining them up directly with the tail cannon. It is possible to destroy the enemy aircraft with less than 10 shells if they are very close and the tail gunner is accurate. Another unorthodox method of using the 20 mm tail cannon involves a situation in which an initial pass on a ground target failed. Depending on how close the IL-10 (1946) is to the ground target, it is possible to destroy it from behind with the 20 mm tail gun. This is very difficult especially as the distance from the target increases.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Meanwhile, in Mainland China, the ongoing civil war between CCP and KMT for the nation has almost over (main KMT forces retreated to Taiwan Island and the remaining were struggling on different coastal islands like Kinmen and Matsu). During that time, China only had propeller aircraft and before the outbreak of Korean War, PLAAF needed new aircraft to flush out remnants of KMT forces from Mainland's coastal islands.\n\nIn 1950, PLAAF started the import of IL-10s from the Soviets and in October, VVS stationed at Shanghai handed 25 of them to PLAAF 13th Assault Regiment; they were one of many aircraft that joined the 1st Anniversary of PRC establishment parade; by 1952, there were 254 of them imported into Mainland China.\n\nThe first time they really shone was in 1954-1955, the Battle of Dachen Island (大陈岛) in costal Taizhou (台州), Fujian, and also Yijiangshan Island (一江山岛) in Zhejiang. From 1st November 1954 till 18 January 1955, IL-10s joined the very first tri-service participated battle of PLA and helped PLAGF flush out the remaining KMT forces on the island. The attackers knocked down dozens of bunkers, buildings and some KMT vessels, once again proving their worthiness as an attacker.\n\nThese aircraft served PLAAF for 2 decades and were eventually replaced by the [[Q-5 early|Q-5]] in the 1970s.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=il-10_1946_china Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Ilyushin}}\n{{China twin-engine fighters and strike aircraft}}"}}
