In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.47 \"Big Guns\"]].\n\nThe IL-2 1941 is the first [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-type strike aircraft]] a pilot will get in the Soviet aircraft tree. Players will quickly find out that this plane is very durable, but somewhat slow and unwieldy... although with some skill this plane can surprise attacking enemies. Players should research bombs and rockets as soon as they can, followed by ammo belts to augment your ground-attack role. This plane, as well as the following IL-type aircraft, have roughly the same base attributes you will find in the Pros and Cons below, with a few minor differences between models.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nFor tactics, IL-2s are built to be close to the ground. Fly very low for IL-2 pilots in reality were known to skim treetops. Further try to stay out of sight of enemy planes. As tough as you are, you cannot take concentrated fire from enemy fighters, especially heavy fighters. As you near your target (about 3 km away) go into a slight climb, then nose down into a moderate dive toward your target. Imagine yourself gliding in, not diving. It is generally recommended that you use bombs first, as this will immediately lighten the plane and make you more manoeuvrable. Because the IL-2 flies so close to the ground, some pilots have destroyed themselves by bombing targets right under them. To avoid this, set the bomb fuses to around 2 seconds.\n\nUse bombs against tanks and pillboxes, rockets against groups of light armoured vehicles (and occasionally enemy aircraft), and use your MGs/Cannons for AAA, Artillery, Armoured cars, and enemy aircraft. If you equip certain ammo belts, you may also be able to destroy pillboxes and light tanks with your primary guns alone! Experience gained with this aircraft will be invaluable for later models, who get larger cannons, rear gunners, and other handy upgrades.\n\nLastly, due to the extraordinary low-altitude style of the IL-2 line of planes, equipping a camouflage that matches the map actually helps in the Realistic/Simulator modes, as you need to get close to enemy planes before they become \"spotted\". Equipping a white camo on a winter map, then flying very low as the IL-2 is made to do, can help keep players from spotting you.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

While the designers nicknamed their aircraft the ''Flying Tank'', Luftwaffe pilots, due to the IL-2's incredible ability to withstand battle damage, instead called it the ''Betonflugzeug'' (Concrete Plane). German ground troops, conversely, despised and feared the IL-2, giving it a slew of unpleasant nicknames, such as ''Schlachter'' (Butcher); ''Fleischwolf'' (Meatgrinder); ''Eiserner Gustav'' (Iron Gustav) and ''Schwarzer Tod'' (the Black Death). Some historians believe that the ''Black Death'' was actually a successful invention of the Soviet propaganda machine that caught on with the Germans.\n\nThe IL-2 was the most mass-produced military aircraft in history. However, early in the war German air superiority coupled with the absence of rear gunners on early variants and poorly organized Soviet fighter escorts led to high rates of losses for the type. A favourite attack tactic for IL-2 pilots was a low-level attack run, first letting loose with rockets at 600-700 meters, then firing on-board armament from a distance of 400 to 600 meters. Bombs would be dropped in subsequent passes from an altitude of 100-200 meters, using an impact fuse. The recommended tactic for attacking concentrations of soft targets was a strafing run in a shallow dive from 100-200 meters and a subsequent dropping of bombs at a low level when exiting the dive.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[IL-2_(1942)|IL-2 (1942)]] succeeding model\n* [[Ju 87 D-5]]\n* [[Hs 129B-2]]\n* [[A-36]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/745|[Devblog] IL-2 AM-38 1941 and Pz.Kpfw.
