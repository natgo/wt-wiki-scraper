In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.51 \"Cold Steel\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe aircraft has an inadequate engine and cooling system, and as such, is slow and has a tendency to try to hit the ground. Air speed bleeds off easily, and climbing is close to impossible.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 2,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nKnown as the \"flying tank\" during the Second World War, the IL-2 has a steel \"armoured bathtub\" around the cockpit and engine, with an average thickness of between 4-6 mm. Its front windscreen however is made from armoured glass, totaling 64 mm, with the side and rear windscreens offering no protection whatsoever. Behind the cockpit is a 12 mm section of steel armour.\n\nGerman ace Erich Hartmann recalled \"a Shturmovik IL-2, which was the toughest aircraft to bring down because of the heavy armour plate. You had to shoot out the oil cooler underneath, otherwise, it would not go down\". Receiving damage to your oil or water coolers is usually fatal, as it will cause your engine to under-perform and eventually cause your demise. The tail area is especially weak, and can be ripped off by enemy fire. The aircraft's engine is inadequate, as is the cooling system; as such, using WEP with this aircraft is not recommended.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|VYa-23 (23 mm)|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 2 x 23 mm VYa-23 cannons, wing-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)\n* 2 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, wing-mounted (750 rpg = 1,500 total)\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|SC50JA (50 kg)|SC250JA (250 kg)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* Without load\n* 4 x 50 kg SC50JA bombs (200 kg total)\n* 2 x 250 kg SC250JA bombs (500 kg total)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIn Air RB, this aircraft can devastate entire columns of enemy tanks and soft targets with ease. The plane's 23 mm cannons' armour-piercing rounds will make easy work of enemy medium tanks when attacking from the sides, and can sometimes from the rear, though this seems to take more ammunition. It's recommended to use bursts when dealing with enemy armour. This aircraft can also excel in head-on attacks against enemy fighters, if needed for defensive actions. If using this plane with a squad of German IL-2s, one could potentially form a makeshift \"circle of death\", with each plane circling while covering the squad-mate ahead of them. If being attacked from behind, reducing power and flying low to the ground may cause the enemy fighter to overshoot into the player's firing zone.\n\nThe main threats to the IL-2 are enemy AAA and SPAA weapons, the occasional Allied attacker (A-36) and once they've arrived, enemy fighters. Most of the time the IL-2 can win a head-on with enemy fighters, however once an enemy climbs, usually the IL-2 player is doomed.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n[[Yak-2 KABB]]: Do not think that the {{PAGENAME}} can confidently out maneuver this plane just because it is twin-engined. The Yak-2 has an amazing turn rate for a heavy fighter, thus the {{PAGENAME}} must avoid turning with it, if not dogfighting with it in general. It bears a pair of ShVAK cannons that can easily damage vital parts like engine or cooling systems. It has green camo, greatly resembling an Me 410 but with an H-tail like a Bf 110's.\n\n[[ZSD63]]: A dangerous SPAA to go up against in Tank Realistic Battles. Though it is hard to identify specific SPAA vehicles on the ground (especially when they are shooting tracers at the plane), if a ZSD63 is identified, avoid it at all costs and '''do not''' attempt head-ons with it, ever. It can easily snap a wing off by casually putting a short burst in the {{PAGENAME}}'s flight path. Don't even get close to it unless the {{PAGENAME}} has a bomb. Even ground target belts on your cannons cannot effectively damage it as its hull is overall quite empty, causing your shells to do little to no damage. Some identifying features of the ZSD63 is its rather boxy and tall hull with a geometric turret sitting at the back, slightly similar to a Wirbelwind's. The firing manner is also distinctive: the sound and green tracers are very rapid, much like a buzz saw, but then it will remain silent for half a minute reloading. Note that an experienced ZSD player will hold its fire or shoot in single salvos with long halts between, making it look like that it's reloading.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Has great armament\n* Gets premium rewards\n* Armour encases engine and cockpit\n* Can be used as a makeshift fighter, so long as the enemy doesn't climb.\n* 23 mm cannons can pierce most light tanks, medium tanks and self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAG) at its battle rating with armoured targets belts\n* Reasonably good turn rate\n* Decent ammo supply\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Lacks defensive armament\n* Inadequate engine + cooling systems\n* Stalls at 170 km/h (105 mph)\n* Although frontal part of the aircraft is armoured the tail will be shot off quite easily\n* No payload consisting of rockets\n* Takes some time to get used to bombing without dive brakes or a bombsight\n* Little to no rear visibility in the cockpit (important in Simulator battles) - visibility vs. survivability\n* Only three payload options vs. the 23 options of the Russian version\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

The aircraft's paint scheme suggests it was most likely built at Zavod 18, as it is typical of paint schemes from this particular factory. All weapons were removed (and later reinstalled) and all markings were painted over, with the addition of a yellow band painted in front of the tail section and under the tips of the wings. Of note is the lack of the inclined Swastika which was present on the original.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:The German IL-2 in flight.jpg\nFile:IL-2 (1942) (Germany) In hangar.png|IL-2 (1942) (Germany) in hangar with bombs\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[IL-2 (1941)]]\n* [[IL-2 (1942)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/195737-ilyushin-il-2-1942/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Ilyushin_IL-2|Ilyushin IL-2]]\n* [http://massimotessitori.altervista.org/sovietwarplanes/pages/il-2/il2-camo/germans/germans.html <nowiki>[massimotessitori.altervista.org]</nowiki> Axis remarked Il-2s]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Ilyushin}}\n{{Germany strike aircraft}}\n{{Germany premium aircraft}}"}}
