If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe IL-2 is an attacker which excels at low altitude. You'll be flying close to the ground in order to hit your targets with your cannons and machine guns, so watch for obstacles and use the IL-2's phenomenal low-speed performance and tight turning circle to get out of harm's way, though beware of the mediocre roll rate and the weak acceleration. Give yourself time to build up a good amount of speed before going for another attack, otherwise, you'll struggle to climb away. Make note of what targets you can eliminate: light pillboxes can be destroyed by your cannons, and even extended MG fire from your 7.62 mm guns, but other pillboxes will be impossible to destroy with your guns, and bombs will need a direct hit. Likewise, light tanks and armoured cars can be destroyed with your guns, but medium tanks will need to be hit from the top or rear to penetrate the thicker armour, and heavy tanks are invulnerable unless you land a direct bomb or rocket hit.\n\nYour bombs and rockets are best used for tougher targets, like pillboxes and medium/heavy tanks. You lack any sort of bombing reticule in Realistic Battles, so aim carefully and get used to how your rockets fall and their velocity. Overall, your load is still very strong. Direct bomb hits will destroy any sized tank, and your rockets can be devastating against ground convoys, especially with your 8 x RBS-132 rockets.\n\nAnother way to play is to select the loadout with the 2 x 250 kg bombs which are a lot more powerful and easier to use than the 100 kg bombs. After dropping your bombs gain some altitude and attack with your guns from a high angle to increase your chances of penetrating the target. This loadout has much less damage potential but takes much less skill.\n\nThe armoured cockpit keeps your pilot safe from harm, and while your engine does have a tendency to take damage, you should still be safe from anti-aircraft artillery unless you're exposed to it for too long. The biggest threat posed to the IL-2 is enemy fighters since you're slower and less manoeuvrable than any fighter at this rank. Unlike the later Shturmovik models, you lack any form of defensive armament, so once an interceptor is on you, typically your outlook is grim. Keep an eye on the movement of enemy fighters and use terrain to hide your movements to and from targets if you can. Once intercepted, make use of the IL-2's slow speed to force overshoots, and use the adequate turning capabilities to dodge fire and get around the fighters. If you have a shot, take it: the 23 mm cannons will shred even large heavy fighters with ease.\n\nThe IL-2 lacks bombsight, however from this model on these planes have white lines on the engine cover in front of the cockpit. In cockpit camera mode, the pilot can use them to aid themselves in predicting where the bombs will fall. Each line has an indicated altitude at which it can be used written near it. Although this helps a lot with smaller bombs, when using heavier ones the lines won't be very helpful, so diving is better than level bombing when using 250 kg bombs.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The designers nicknamed their aircraft the \"Flying Tank\". Luftwaffe pilots, due to the IL-2's incredible ability to withstand battle damage, called it the \"Betonflugzeug\" or \"Concrete Plane\". German ground troops, conversely, despised and feared the IL-2, giving it a slew of unpleasant nicknames, such as \"Schlachter\" (Butcher); \"Fleischwulf\" (Meatgrinder); \"Eiserner Gustav\" (Iron Gustav) and \"Schwarzer Tod\" (the Black Death). Some historians believe that the \"Black Death\" was actually a successful invention of the Soviet propaganda machine that caught on with the Germans.\n\nThe IL-2 was the most mass-produced military aircraft in history. However, early in the war German air superiority coupled with the absence of rear gunners on early variants and poorly organized Soviet fighter escorts led to high rates of losses for the type. A favorite attack tactic for IL-2 pilots was a low-level attack run, first letting loose with rockets at 600-700 meters, then firing on-board armament from a distance of 400 to 600 meters. Bombs would be dropped in subsequent passes from an altitude of 100-200 meters, using an impact fuse. The recommended tactic for attacking concentrations of soft targets was a strafing run in a shallow dive from 100-200 meters and a subsequent dropping of bombs at low level when exiting the dive.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=il-2i Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/195737-ilyushin-il-2-1942/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Ilyushin}}\n{{USSR strike aircraft}}"}}
