In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].\n\nBeing a jet bomber, the Soviet post-war IL-28 occupies the traditional role of \"fast bomber\" previously endowed to aircraft like the [[Pe-2-359|Pe-2-359 Peshka]]. Thus, its major advantage is being able to quickly swoop down to the target area and dispense its payload without being caught by enemy aircraft. The IL-28 relies on speed, acceleration, bomb capacity, and defensive capabilities to survive. Unlike some of the aircraft the IL-28 may face, it is able to quickly accelerate, leaving would-be attackers in the dust. This single facet of the aircraft's performance is often a gamechanger, as it allows the IL-28 to quickly disengage from any dogfight or bombing run. This aircraft features a wide range of payload options including up to 3000 kg of bombs stored in the aircraft's internal bomb bay. To the naked eye, this rather minuscule payload may seem insignificant. However, by utilizing this aircraft's strengths pilots may find themselves able to single-handedly win the match by destroying all of the enemy's ground targets and running down their ticket count. This tactic of attrition is more than plausible, especially on realistic battles maps like Korea, where ground targets are often fairly centrally located and thus easy to destroy.\n\nUnlike its American and British counterparts, the IL-28 features a heavy-hitting defensive armament of two 23 mm NR-23 cannons mounted in the tail barbette. This turret setup is unique in that it features an extremely high degree of manoeuvrability, able to almost fire straight up and down. This single aspect of the IL-28 is what truly makes it a legendary aircraft, especially among the War Thunder community. Often described as being able to fire \"23 mm lasers\", the IL-28's tail cannons are capable of equipping belts composed entirely of destructive fragmentation incendiary tracer ammunition. The NR-23 cannons also fire unusually quickly, which makes the aircraft's one-second burst mass very high. This makes the aircraft more than capable of defending itself, an invaluable asset in Rank V battles. There is also 102 mm bulletproof glass in front of the gunner along with a lot more armor, making him very hard to knock out. The IL-28 also wields two of these weapons in forward-facing positions under the nose, which allows the aircraft to destroy softer targets like AAA and artillery.\n\nWhile the 23 mm cannons are extremely potent when they strike both ground and air units, the fact that they fire so quickly makes it very possible to run out of ammunition even when firing in short bursts. Thus, a good aim is essential for success when using these weapons. The same issue applies to the IL-28's tail guns, which utilize the same cannons but with a larger ammunition pool. Having the crew \"reload speed\" upgrade maxed out allows the aircraft's tail guns to reload much faster which can be invaluable during an engagement. The tail gun can also be used to finish off softer ground targets after a failed frontal attack.\n\nThe IL-28 starts off with twelve 100 kg bombs which in some cases are not enough to make a true impact on the match's result. Therefore, attaining the \"KD-3\" and \"BD-4\" bomb upgrades is essential. Having these allows the IL-28 to destroy heavier ground targets such as heavy and medium tanks, pillboxes, and various heavy naval units like destroyers.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nDue to its impressive low-altitude manoeuvring capabilities (for a medium bomber), the IL-28 can be utilized in a variety of roles. In all game modes, if a teammate is struggling to evade an assailant, the IL-28 may be able to provide the supporting fire with its dual 23 mm cannons. The aircraft is hampered in this role partly because of its mediocre roll rate and low ammunition count for its forward-firing cannons. If its bomb load is expended, the IL-28 is also a very capable \"gunship\", or a bomber aircraft whose role is to attract, distract, and destroy enemy aircraft. Other aircraft that can perform this role include the [[G8N1|G8N1 Renzan]], [[IL-10 (1946)]], [[B-29A-BN|B-29 Superfortress]], and [[B-24D-25-CO|B-24D Liberator]], among others.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Although there were several previous attempts to create such an aircraft the IL-28 was the first successful design. It incorporated the new Rolls-Royce Nene engines, produced as the unlicensed \"RD-45\". After the completion of testing in 1949, the aircraft was ordered into production on 14 May 1949, with the new Klimov VK-1, an improved version of the previous RD-45. The IL-28 was widely exported and was utilized by almost all of the Warsaw Pact nations along with various Middle Eastern and African nations. It was license-built in China as the Harbin H-5 and in Czechoslovakia as the Avia B-228. It is known to still be in service today in the Korean People's Air Force (KPAF). Although few in number, they provide North Korea with a means of strategically bombing targets.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nAn all-metal cantilever monoplane with a crew of three. Created at OKB S.V. Ilyushina.\n\nS.V. Ilyushin put forward his preliminary design for the Il-28 on 12 January 1948. By 8 July 1948, the test pilot V.K. Kokkinaki took the Il-28 out for its maiden flight. It was equipped with two turbojet Rolls-Royce Nene engines. On 30 December 1948, the Il-28 underwent in-plant tests with the Russian series-produced RD-45F engine – a licensed version of the English engine.\n\nBut the decision on the aircraft's fate was delayed until 14 May 1949, when the Council of Ministers decided to increase the Il-28's speed to 900 km/h by installing more powerful VK-1 engines with a maximum thrust of 2,700 kgf. In only three months, on 8 August 1949, the Il-28 took its maiden flight with the VK-1 engines.\n\nThe turbojet VK-1 engines were located under the wing in streamlined engine nacelles.\n\nThe Il-28's armament included two turrets – one to the fore and one to the rear. Two frontal 23 mm Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannons with 100 shells each were mounted in a fixed position in side compartments in the front fuselage. The pilot acted as gunner for the frontal cannons.\n\nThe movable Il-K6 tail turret also contained two 23 mm Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannons, these with 225 shells each.\n\nThe aircraft could carry bombs of various calibers internally, up to and including the FAB-3000. Its bomb compartment could contain 12 FAB-100 bombs or eight FAB-250s, or between two and four FAB-500s, or a single FAB-1500 or FAB-3000.\n\nThe Il-28 became the most mass-produced jet-powered bomber. The aircraft was easy to manufacture and reliable in use. It was in series production between the years of 1950 and 1956. The Il-28 reached peak production during the Korean War: in 1953, six plants were building them at once. In total, 4,405 Il-28 bombers were produced. In the 50s, the Il-28 was the main front-line bomber in the Soviet Air Forces.\n\nThe Il-28 was widely distributed beyond the borders of the USSR. It served in the air forces or air-defense forces of: Algeria, Afghanistan, Bulgaria, Hungary, Vietnam, East Germany, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Yemen, China, North Korea, Morocco, Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Syria, Somalia, Finland and Czechoslovakia. The People's Republic of China and Czechoslovakia produced them under license (with the designation B-228).\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=il_28 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [http://warthunder.com/en/news/4825-profile-ilyushin-il-28-en [Vehicle Profile<nowiki>]</nowiki> Ilyushin IL-28]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/191159-ilyushin-il-28/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Ilyushin}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
