In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 \"Project X\"]]. The main difference with the IL-28 is the additional suspended armament.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe IL-28Sh 'Beagle', being a attacker modification of the previous [[IL-28]], retains its predecessor's characteristics. The aircraft has lacklustre acceleration and top speed for its BR, which is to be expected as it was derived from a bomber. In fact, the aircraft has a set of takeoff boosters to help get it off the runway! Typically, these are not absolutely necessary to get the plane off the ground, but are a helpful addition as they can boost the IL-28's acceleration significantly for a short duration of time. The aircraft's top speed of 933 km/h spaded allows it to outrun most aircraft it faces in downtiers, but this advantage is lost in higher-tier battles.\n\nThe 'Beagle' has relatively mediocre flight characteristics given its size and weight. When flying it, it is to be expected that the aircraft feels rather sluggish. That said, the control surfaces are large, and remain responsive up to the airframe's critical speed. The plane's roll rate and turn rate are both unimpressive, though it is able to turn relatively quickly at the expense of speed. As well, beware the the airframe has a critical speed of just 850 km/h IAS - this means that the IL-28Sh will frequently break its wings in dives.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe IL-28Sh is an extremely versatile aircraft, thanks to its extensive suspended ordnance options. The aircraft can be used as a bomber, or as a CAS aircraft with its rockets. As well, the IL-28Sh gets access to a powerful forward-firing and defensive set of 23 mm cannons, which can be further augmented by a pair of UPK-23-250 gunpods each carrying a GSh-23L cannon - combined, these can provide a forward firing burst mass of over 25 kilograms, which is the highest burst mass of any aircraft at its BR.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the IL-28Sh can be used as a base-bomber in RB. This is initially difficult due to its small stock load of twelve 100 kg bombs, but becomes much easier once the 3,000 kg bomb is unlocked. This monster of a bomb is the second-largest bomb in the game, after the [[Pe-8]]'s [[FAB-5000 (5,000 kg)|FAB-5000]] bomb. This bomb can one-shot bases very easily. When used in this manner, proceed to the nearest base as fast as possible (possibly in a slight dive), drop ordnance, and run. This ensures that the IL-28Sh won't be intercepted by any fighters, which will take more time to get there. Attempting to climb may not be the best option, as many enemy fighters can get to bomber altitude very quickly.\n\nThe second, and more interesting option for the IL-28Sh is ground attack. The aircraft can carry a variety of powerful ground-attack ordnance (namely the aforementioned 3,000 kg bomb and the six S-24 rockets), which make the aircraft extremely effective in mixed battles. When used in this manner, it is worth noting that the aircraft is much more vulnerable, especially in air battles where enemy fighters will arrive extremely quickly. The first effective load for ground attack is the aforementioned 3,000 kg bomb; despite only having a single drop, the bomb is effective enough to take out every enemy tank at a base. This option also ensures the safety of the aircraft, as you will be able to escape quickly after dropping the bomb.\n\nThe second, and more interesting option, are the S-24 rockets. These rockets, similar to the earlier [[S-21]] and American [[Tiny Tim]] rockets, are massive, and pack 25 kilograms of explosive filler. They are especially effective against lighter-armoured targets, which will be destroyed by the rocket's huge blast. The IL-28 can carry six of these rockets, which fire singly. The aircraft can also carry 192 S-5K rockets, but these are less effective due to their much smaller warhead. More hits will be required to destroy the targets.\n\nThe IL-28Sh shouldn't be used in an air-to-air role, as it will be outmanoeuvred and outspeeded by most fighters at its BR. If being pursued, employ evasive manoeuvres, and utilize the IL-28's powerful tail gun to shoot at pursuing fighters. The tail turret, packing two NR-23 autocannons, is especially effective, and can easily destroy pursuing attackers. As well, the IL-28 can encounter early missiles such as the [[AIM-9B Sidewinder|AIM-9B]]. If an enemy fires a missile at you, wait until the missile gets close, then perform a sharp manoeuvre. The early missile's weak seeker and G-force capability prevents it from tracking reliably.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nDevelopment work on the IL-28Sh (Sh = Shturmovik; attacker) began in 1967 after it became clear that the main fighter-bomber of the Soviet air force, the MiG-15, had insufficient combat loads. As a result of this, Soviet engineers once more began looking into the possibility of converting some IL-28 bombers into attack aircraft. This resulted in the creation of the IL-28Sh, a regular IL-28 modified to fit 12 external pylons suspended underneath the wings. This allowed the IL-28Sh to carry, in addition to its standard internal payloads, a large number of suspended ordnance options ranging from rocket-and gunpods to additional bombs.\n\nTesting of the modified machine began in autumn 1967, showing positive results. However, the way the Soviet high command envisioned to use the aircraft as an attacker contradicted some of the design choices made initially, while the aircraft was still intended to be used as a bomber. To fully utilize the destructive power of its expanded payload options and to avoid premature detection as well as anti-aircraft fire, the IL-28Sh was intended to be used at low to extremely low altitudes (going as low as 60 m). Operating at extremely low altitude like this meant that the crew of the Il-28Sh had to undergo special training in order to acquire the skills needed to use the machine this way. However, the biggest advantage that this kind of low-level flying offered was excellent visibility for both the pilot and bombardier as well as allowing the aircraft to be operated from front-line airfields. Nonetheless, testing also showed that the IL-28Sh wasn't without its flaws. Not only did the IL-28Sh lack sufficient enough armour protection to be used in this kind of role, but that the risk of losing the crew in an emergency situation was far greater than usually. These severe drawbacks ultimately led to the IL-28Sh being classified as unsuitable for the role of an attack aircraft and the project was shut down soon afterwards. Despite 70 regular IL-28 units being planned to be converted to the attacker version, only a handful of them was actually modified before the project was shut down.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5565-development-il-28sh-the-soviet-rocketeer-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=il_28sh Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|80ajQCMfdto|'''The Shooting Range #112''' - ''War Machines'' section at 04:32 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|Fjh-tTr6TPs|'''Best Combo #2'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:27  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|vhTZXYk6eao|'''Tank busters''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:40 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of a similar role, configuration or era\n* [[Canberra (Family)]]\n* [[Tu-14T]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5565-development-il-28sh-the-soviet-rocketeer-en|[Devblog] IL-28Sh: The Soviet Rocketeer]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/191159-ilyushin-il-28/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Ilyushin}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
