It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe IL-2M type 3 is an improved version of the famous \"Sturmovik\" ground attack aircraft. It featured an \"arrow wing\" design, possessed leading edges that were swept back 15 degrees on the outer panels, giving it a better manoeuvrability and aerodynamic characteristics.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

This, combined with an addition of combat flaps, makes the plane very flexible and can take on almost every enemy at its BR.\n\n==== Details ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Features\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe IL-2M type 3 is an attacker which excels at low altitude. You'll be flying close to the ground in order to hit your targets with your cannons and machine guns, so watch for obstacles and use the IL-2's phenomenal low-speed performance and tight turning circle to get out of harm's way, though beware of the mediocre roll rate and the weak acceleration. Give yourself time to build up a good amount of speed before going for another attack, otherwise, you'll struggle to climb away. Make note of what targets you can eliminate: light pillboxes can be destroyed by your cannons, and even extended MG fire from your 7.62 mm guns, but other pillboxes will be impossible to destroy with your guns, and bombs will need a direct hit. Likewise, light tanks and armoured cars can be destroyed with your guns, but medium tanks will need to be hit from the top or rear to penetrate the thicker armour, and heavy tanks are invulnerable unless you land a direct bomb or rocket hit.\n\nThe most interesting additions of the IL-2M type 3 is the wing redesign. An addition of combat flaps and more aerodynamically efficient wing design means that the plane is now more nimble than the single seat [[IL-2 (1942)]]. This makes the Type 3 capable of executing some tight turns to caught an enemy off guard, or attacking ground targets more efficiently.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nOn 21st July 1941 the lead designer of the IL-2 Sergey Ilyushin sent a request to the People's Minister of Aviation, calling for improvement of the IL-2 by upgrading the engine to a 1,675-HP M-82 and increasing the aircraft's armor. The request was extremely urgent, considering that the rapidly advancing German troops at the time threatened serial production of the engines then used on the IL-2. Several influential Party members also called for upgrading the IL-2's engine. Another crucial change, in conjunction with the engine, called for converting the aircraft into a two-seater, based on combat experience. The second crewman would mainly deal with protecting the rear section of the Sturmovik from aerial attack, making it, in the designer's opinion, \"nearly invincible\". An aft fuel tank, previously installed behind the pilot in the armored tub, was replaced with a gunner compartment under a stretched canopy, armed with a 12.7mm (.50-cal) UBT machine gun with 280 rounds of ammunition. The gunner position, just like the pilot's, was well armored.\n\nOnce the prototype was tested, all test pilots concluded that flight performance of the new variant was worse than that of the earlier IL-2 AM-38 variant; however, no changes in overall behavior were noted, the armor was very effective, and no shortcomings that made flying dangerous were uncovered. Therefore, the new prototype was accepted for serial production.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=il-2m Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/195739-ilyushin-il-2m-mstitel-34avenger34/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Ilyushin}}\n{{USSR attackers}}"}}
