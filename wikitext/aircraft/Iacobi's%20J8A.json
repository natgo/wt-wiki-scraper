It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]]. It was gifted to players during the [[wt:en/news/6536-new-year-in-war-thunder-en|2019 \"New year holidays\"]] mini-event.\n\n{{PAGENAME}}, or the original Gloster Gladiator Mk II, was developed in an awkward time, in that it was an advancement in biplane technology over what was already in production, however, its time was almost up even before it rolled out the door as state-of-the-art monoplanes were beginning to take to the skies and outperform even the most advanced biplanes. Though a long future looked grim for the Gladiator, nevertheless it went into production and found a place in the Air Forces not only for the British but other nations such as the Swedish.\n\nInitially a private venture by Gloster, the SS.37 started by modifying an existing prototype, the Gloster Gauntlet and outfit it with a Bristol Mercury M.E.30 radial engine and streamline the existing structure and wings to increase aerodynamic efficiency. By the time trials started, the plane was outfitted with a Mercury IV engine and then retooled for the Mercury VIS engine. Later adjustments outfitted the aircraft with a Mercury IX engine and a two-blade wooden fixed-pitch propeller, though some later models switched to a three-bladed metal pitch-adjustable propeller.\n\nThe Gladiator was the last British biplane to be produced, but it was the first one to feature a fully enclosed cockpit and though it entered service with the British, it almost immediately left the service being replaced by newer-generation fighters such as the Hawker [[Hurricane (Family)|Hurricane]] and Supermarine [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire]]. While the British no longer found use with the biplanes, other nations felt they would be a fine addition and countries such as Sweden and 12 other countries nabbed up 216 of the remaining Gladiators. Those picked up by Sweden were redesignated J8A (Jaktplan = fighter airplane).\n\nOn 13 December 1939, Sweden, after purchasing aircraft from the UK including 12 Gladiator Mk II Aircraft (representing 1/3 of the entire Swedish Air Force at that time), formed a volunteer Swedish Air unit in order to assist Finnish Forces in the Winter War.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\nThis unit, known as F19, who flew into combat on 12 January 1940, (the first Combat mission for Swedish Air Forces in History) and whose acting commander was Ian Iacobi, was responsible for the northern parts of the country, which were saved from the worst bomb damage and the railway connection between Oulu and Sweden (which was critical for the transport of war material and foodstuffs) that they kept open and in operating condition. The fighters can be counted as having repelled at least 35 enemy bombing sorties to the northern region alone.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.''-->\n\nThe J8A is an average biplane in terms of manoeuvrability, however, it is very stiff to the controls when attempting to roll the aircraft. Though an excellent flyer at lower altitudes and at lower speeds, keeping its speed up will increase its effectiveness when engaging in turn battles with other aircraft. The Bristol Mercury-IX engine allows this aircraft to reach top speeds of over 400 km/h (~250 mph) and can be a contender with other biplanes, however, it will start to struggle against early monoplanes such as the Heinkel [[He 112 (Family)|He 112]], Messerschmitt [[Flegel's Bf 109 A|Bf 109A]], Polykarpov [[I-16 (Family)|I-16]] and the Brewster [[F2A-1|F2A]] fighters. Though not as fast nor does it have the armament these do, it does have a turning advantage they do not and can sometimes make a quick turn around or tail-chase a faster fighter long enough to put guns on target and eliminate an enemy.\n\nThe J8A has a very low stall speed and with the throttle reduced to around 55%, this fighter can maintain level flight at a speed of about 80 km/h (50 mph) without nosing over. The vertical stabilizer is rather large for an aircraft of this type which lends itself to being an excellent aircraft for performing wing-over and hammerhead manoeuvres, especially when luring newer and unsuspecting enemy pilots into a rope-a-dope manoeuvre allowing for the J8A to immediately change direction and pursue the tailing enemy fighter which may have themselves stalled out and set themselves up to be the perfect target for an inbound J8A.  \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,420 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nLike many aircraft just prior to the break out of World War II, the J8A was not outfitted with any armour plating. The J8A relied on its engine to get the aircraft where it needed to go and helped the aircraft get into a position where the guns should shoot down an enemy, any attempts to install armour plating would have only slowed down the already relatively slow biplane which would not have been worth the trade-off.\n\nTo maintain the centre of balance for this fighter, the pilot, fuel tank and engine take up the fuselage from the middle to the front, any attacks on this aircraft in this zone risk hitting a critical component, ending the J8A's fight in the battle earlier than expected. Though a closed cockpit may offer the pilot protection from glancing shots, it will not do much for head-on or side attacks.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Ksp m/22 (8 mm)}}\n\n'''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 2 x 8 mm Ksp m/22 machine guns, side-mounted (600 rpg = 1,200 total)\n* 2 x 8 mm Ksp m/22 machine guns, wing-mounted (400 rpg = 800 total)\n\nThe Swedish Air Forces decided to not outfit their J8A fighters with the standard .303 machine guns the British typically used, instead, they opted to install four 8 mm Ksp m/22 machine guns, two mounted on each side of the pilot within arm's reach and the other two were mounted one under each side of the lower wing. It is important for pilots of this aircraft to determine at what distance they typically engage enemy aircraft at as convergence of the machine guns is a necessity to manage to effectively put as many bullets as possible into the enemy fighter. Typically in biplanes, a closer convergence setting of 100 to 250 m is best for close-in fighting, typically as one gets farther out from there, bullets lose some of their punch.\n\nMany ace pilots from all sides of the war stated that when the enemy filled the windscreen, there was no way you could not hit, thereby guaranteeing a hit and conserving ammunition. The J8A does not have the machine-gun speed of those found on some Soviet biplanes as it is necessary to synchronize the firing of the guns in the fuselage to fire through the propeller arc. With 2,000 rounds of ammunition distributed between all four machine guns, it is recommended to fire in short bursts, mainly to prevent overheating and jamming of the machine guns. Typically you can continuously fire about 750 rounds of ammunition before the guns jam up and require a cool down before they can be used again.\n\nWhen possible, change out the default ammunition belts for either Air Targets belts which are very effective against other biplanes, especially those which have fabric coverings and non-self sealing fuel tanks as incendiary rounds have a good chance of setting planes on fire which can rarely put the flames out. Universal belts are also a good choice, and the presence of extra AP rounds will help take down ground targets and more heavily built planes that can be seen in an up-tier, such as [[Hurricane (Family)|Hurricanes]]. For those pilots who like to sneak into a fight and catch enemy aircraft unaware, stealth belts are the way to go as there are no tracer rounds to give away your position. The enemy pilots tend to realize where the stealth bullets are coming from only too late as their aircraft is coming apart and falling to the ground.\n\nThis aircraft's Armoured Targets bullets are potent enough to penetrate tanks at this battle-rating, since they can penetrate around 20 mm of armour at 500 m. This, however, is not advised, since the projectiles fired are bullets rather than shells.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!--''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->\n\nOn early maps which tend to favour biplanes and some early monoplanes, the J8A pilot has the option to decide which type of target they will go after and arm up the ammunition to do so. The J8A is a multirole aircraft which can pursue either air-to-air combat, ground attack or both. The J8A is a very effective turn fighter and can hold its own against many early biplanes, but due to its speed, it has the option to turn fight or attempt early Boom & Zoom runs. If flying at an altitude above the enemy aircraft, the J8A can selectively choose targets, swoop down on them and either zoom back up to altitude or zoom away out of range of slower aircraft before turning around.\n\nOne of the advantages of this aircraft's low-speed capabilities is its very low stall speed, which lends itself to be handy when strafing ground targets. Lightly armoured targets such as anti-aircraft artillery, light trucks and some light tanks can be in reach with the J8A. When swooping in at a lower speed and attacking ground targets, after a pass, fly up in a shallow climb and perform a wing-over to immediately face the direction you just came in and begin to target up enemy vehicles and repeat. Fortified pill-boxes, medium and heavy tanks should be avoided as they will be relatively impervious to 8 mm gunfire unless using Armoured Targets belts, in which case, pillboxes and light tanks may be penetrated at ranges between 100 and 500 m. It will, however, take a fair amount of bullets, so pilots should be wary of their ammo count when engaging ground targets.\n\nJ8A fighters work great in teams of two or three. Fighters can rotate being \"bait\" for enemy aircraft, attempting to take an enemy for a tail and while the enemy if focusing on their target, one or both of your teammates then zip in and take out the enemy target and if you happen to catch them when they are close to stall speed, the easier it will be to eliminate them from the match.\n\n'''Simulator Battles'''\n\nIn Simulator battles, like the similar Gladiator, the J8A is excellent in turning tightly and continuously, and it has lovely low-speed handling and low stall speeds, making it a great starter plane for Sim. However it does have its drawbacks: the rather big nose blocks the visibility a lot, offering very poor over-the-nose visibility which is a disadvantage in a turn fight, because when leading a shot the enemy will always get obstructed by the engine, making the player guess the shot. Also its upper wings and various frames and strings between the wings will get in the way when you look aside. Note: it is recommended to set the convergence within 300 m, because the majority of turnfights happen at that range or closer.\n\nBefore engaging a fight, it is better to have an altitude advantage first. When approaching the fight try to figure out which is your teammate and which is the enemy, to avoid going for a second pass, as the energy retention of the J8A is rather poor. Also pick your target carefully. For easier aiming, you want to go for those unmanoeuvrable twin engine aircraft for target practice, like [[Ju 88 (Family)|Ju 88]] or [[Ki-45 (Family)|Ki-45]], or bombers if there are any. Given the bad forward visibility of the J8A, these are the best options for Simulator beginners as they are quite slow and sluggish, and are a bigger target to hit. However getting hits on them doesn't mean good damage, so you must be patient. When dealing with fighters, it will be way harder to aim. The elevator control of the J8A is quite sensitive, giving it good manoeuvrability, but at the same time, bad handling. The J8A will respond in a very fast turn upon moving your stick/mouse by a little bit, which makes tracking nimble planes quite hard as it always over-pitch. But once you get used to it, try to lure every enemy into a turnfight, as that is where the J8A shines. If you find an enemy at your six, utilise your great turning ability and simply do tight turns, most monoplanes won't be able to cut inside your turn and they might disengage. However with biplanes you will need some defensive manoeuvres like barrel rolls.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n[[Ki-27 otsu]], [[N1K1]], [[He 51 (Family)|He 51]], [[Gladiator (Family)|Gladiator]], etc. - Those commonly seen planes are equally good at turnfights and will be a hard target to down since they are very small and agile. To deal with them you need to practice leading and deflection shots, plus manoeuvres like barrel rolls and scissors. They might survive a few bullets from the 8 mm MGs, so these kind of targets are quite hard to kill and requires great skills from the J8A pilot, especially in simulator.\n\n[[Do 17 Z-2]] - In simulator battles, this early twin engine plane always shows up as an AI controlled recon aircraft that you have to down, which is a good news as AI won't manoeuvre aggressively. However this plane is extremely durable for the J8A's MGs. When it shows up as an AI, deflection shots are not recommended as the small shooting windows really do nothing. Instead, try disabling its 2 gunners first, then just sit behind it and burst on its wings and engines. When attacking the gunners try to not get your engine damaged by pulling evasive manoeuvres as soon as the bullets come close. The Do 17 might outrun the J8A in a level flight if your engine is damaged.\n\n[[He 100 D-1]], [[Bf 109 E-1]], [[He 112 (Family)|He 112]] - These early monoplanes might not be able to out-turn the J8A but they can easily outrun it as the J8A is rather slow. These fighters will usually BnZ you, so you must constantly look above and behind you. If they are diving on you, use your roll rate and dodge under their negative G areas. Most players will try to follow up, if not immediately losing track of you. Several dodges might make them impatient and give up BnZ, and if they really start to turnfight with you, they are pretty much dead.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The new fighter wing was intended to provide an aerial defence to the Stockholm region and would consist of three squadrons. After a selection process, the Gloster Gladiator was found to be the aircraft most suited to requirements, and an order was made for 55 aircraft, which were to be locally fitted with engines and armament.\n\nThe first Gloster Gladiator was delivered to the Swedish Air Force on April 15th 1937 and locally designated as the 'Jaktplan 8' (J8). While the first few Swedish Gladiators were fitted with the Fairey three-bladed propeller, the decision was taken to switch back to the earlier fixed-pitch two-bladed wooden propeller. The first 37 aircraft were built to Gladiator Mk.I standard with a 645 hp NOHAB-built Bristol Mercury VIS2; the last batch of 18 aircraft were built to Gladiator Mk.II standard with an 840 hp NOHAB-built Bristol Mercury VIII. The former batch thus became known as the J8, while the latter batch was known as the J8A. Both types were armed with the Ksp m/36, which was a license-built version of the Browning M1917 chambered for 8x63 mm ammunition. Deliveries of the Swedish Gloster Gladiator concluded on July 16th 1939, but two aircraft were already lost in service before deliveries were finalised. The Gladiators were initially allocated to F1 Västmanland in 1937 before a new wing was formed. This wing, F8, was transferred to Barkarby, north of Stockholm, in October of 1938, becoming F8 Barkarby.\n\n'''Service life'''\n\nInitial impressions of the Gloster Gladiator were mixed: the type was brand-new (having first flown in 1934 and having entered RAF service in February of 1937), but already conceptually outdated in comparison with types such as the German Bf 109, British Hawker Hurricane and the American P-35. As a result, more modern types were urgently sourced.\n\nInternational events led to the Swedish J8 to have their combat debut in 1939 - albeit not under Swedish colours. Following the invasion of Finland by the Soviet Union on November 30th 1939, numerous countries offered military support to Finland, including neighbouring Sweden which went as far to form a volunteer squadron - ''Flygflottilj 19'' - which would enter combat under Finnish colours. The F19 Wing consisted of 12 J8A Gloster Gladiators capable of carrying 8 light bombs and 4 B4 Hawker Harts light bombers, supported by a Junkers F13, a Raab-Katzenstein RB-26 and a Waco ZQC-6 liaison aircraft, and was manned entirely by Swedish volunteers. After intense negotiations and preparations during December 1939 and early January 1940, the F19 Wing entered combat on January 12th 1940 with a raid on Soviet troop concentrations and air bases near Märkäjärvi, Salmijärvi and Salla. While the Hawker Hart bombers fared rather badly against enemy opposition (two collided and one was shot down on this first raid, with one crew member killed, two taken prisoner of war and three managing to ski back to their bases), the Gloster Gladiators went on to do rather better during their deployment. Over the course of two months, Swedish pilots claimed 10 kills; other than the 3 Harts lost on the first raid, the unit only lost three Gladiators of which two were lost in accidents (one in a landing accident, pilot unhurt, and one due to structural failure, pilot killed), and one was shot down by Soviet airmen on January 23rd 1940 (pilot killed in action). Following the cease-fire of March 13th 1940, the F19 Wing returned to Sweden and was disbanded.\n\n'''Post winter-war and withdrawal'''\n\nIn 1940, F8 Barkarby was re-equipped with the J9 (Seversky EP-1), with the J8s transferred to the F9 Säve wing which was tasked with protecting Gothenborg. The J8's stint with F9 was short, being replaced by the J11 (Fiat CR.42), after which they were used to equip the F10 Ängelholm Wing tasked with protecting Malmö. When the F10 Wing, in turn, was re-equipped with the J20 (Reggiane Re.2000), the J8's role as a frontline fighter in Swedish Air Force service was considered over, and the aircraft were distributed among other wings as advanced trainers, reserves and base hacks. During the latter part of their career in the Swedish Air Force, J8s were used piecemeal by the F8, F9, F10, F13, F16 and F20 wings. About 20 aircraft remained in service at the end of the Second World War, at which point they were progressively withdrawn from service as they were considered as being at the end of their service life. The last three Swedish J8 Gladiators were withdrawn from service on February 10th 1947.\n\n=== Ian Iacobi ===\n'''Background'''\n\nIan Iacobi was born on the 7th of May 1916. Iacobi was born and raised in Stockholm, and thus initially enlisted as a fighter pilot at F8 Barkarby, stationed just outside of town. The division operated Gloster Gladiators, and as the Finnish winter war began, Iacobi enlisted for the Swedish Volunteer Corps to aid the Finnish against the Soviet invasion. \n[[File:Ian Iacobi.jpg|alt=grayscale image of Ian Iacobi wearing his uniform, captured in 1940.|thumb|Ian Iacobi pictured in 1940]]\n'''Winter War Service'''\n\nIacobi was stationed at F19 fighter wing, an air division made up of volunteers, and various biplanes provided by the Swedish government. The air division was outfitted with early Bristol Bulldogs, along with the Swedish [[J6B|J6 Jaktfalken]] from December 8th. As the division was being set up, the government decided to send down J8 Gladiators on December 30th, along with volunteered pilots for said aircraft. Ian Iacobi was part of the twelve gladiators that flew missions over Finland and is famous for being the first Swedish aviator in history to down an enemy fighter. This kill was achieved by Iacobi on the 12th of January 1940. This mission, which was an aerial attack against the 145 IAP Soviet air-division made up of [[I-15 (Family)|I-15s]]. The attack was far from a success, as the Swedish division lost three Hawker Harts, two of which collided midair, resulting in a casualty. Ian Iacobi never got his kill confirmed by Soviet officials even after the war, but this isn't outside the box for many aerial victories. Ian Iacobi would take part in many aerial operations over Finland until the end of the Winter War. His second most successful mission was on January 23rd, where Iacobi, along with 8 other Gladiators, provided air support for Finnish Ground-Forces over Märkäjarvi-Salmijärvi. Iacobi was commanding the operation, and together the gladiators fended off the Soviet counterattack, by damaging three other I-15s. In February of the same year, Ian Iacobi took over command of F19, as the old captain went home to Sweden.\n\n'''Post Winter War and later life'''\n\nAfter the winter war, Iacobi continued his service in the air force, and in April 1941, Iacobi was promoted as a lieutenant at F10 Ängelholm, the southernmost airbase in Sweden. Iacobi would continue to climb ranks during the years and between 1962 and 1966, Ian Iacobi was the wing commander of F10. Ian Iacobi would pass away in 2008 aged 92. Although Iacobi never shot down more than a single plane, his importance during the Winter War, as well as his military service during the Swedish neutrality, makes him a remarkable aviator.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=gladiator_j8a_iacobi Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n;Other variants in-game\n\n* [[Gladiator (Family)]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Grumman [[F3F-2|F3F]]\n* Polikarpov [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]]\n* Polikarpov [[I-153 M-62|I-153]]\n* Fiat [[CR.32]]\n* Fiat [[CR.42]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.ru/index.php?/topic/197035-gloster-gladiator-mk-ii-iis-iif-taka/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance (Russian Forum)]\n* [[Wikipedia:Gloster_Gladiator|[Wikipedia] Gloster Gladiator]]\n* [http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/gladiator_sweden.htm <nowiki>[Håkans aviation page]</nowiki> J8 Gloster Gladiator in the Swedish Air Force]\n* [http://users.kymp.net/mode0522/planes/gladiator.html <nowiki>[Jari Juvonen's page]</nowiki> Gloster Gladiator Mk II ( J8A )]\n\n=== References ===\n<references>\n<ref name=\"Facebook\">War Thunder Facebook Photos - https://www.facebook.com/WarThunderNA/photos/a.219993068374000/976118789428087/?type=3&theater - used with permission of WT user '''Frying_Tiger'''.</ref>\n</references>\n\n{{AirManufacturer Gloster}}\n{{Sweden fighters}}\n{{Sweden premium aircraft}}"}}
