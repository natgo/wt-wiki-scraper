If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe newly gained top speed performance and manoeuvrability come at a hefty price. Turn rate and low speed flexibility are reduced, due the stronger swept wing design and weight gain.\n\nAcceleration also takes a hit, especially on take-off the predecessor will rush ahead.\n\nAs some positive characteristics traits of the MiG-15 vanish, some negative aspects also vanish. The newly designed tail enables far better control close to Mach 0.8 (it still lacks a flying tail though) and the roll rate also significantly improved. Manual limitation set the airframe at positive 8G, with the increased control the likelihood of over stressing your airframe is easy and a steady hand required in evasive manoeuvres.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

One theory suggested that J-4 was the Chinese designation of the [[MiG-15bis]], though this was later debunked when it was found that the [[J-2]] was in fact a 15bis model.  The most likely theory (and the one followed in-game) is that the designation was applied to imported Soviet-built MiG-17As, while license-built MiG-17Fs were designated [[Shenyang F-5|Shenyang J-5 (F-5)]].\n\nThe MiG-17 was purchased and used by the PLAAF during the early Cold War era. It saw service alongside the MiG-15 during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, fighting against the ROCAF's F-86 Sabres. The two air forces were matched fairly evenly in terms of aircraft, perhaps with performance advantage going to the MiG-17s over the Sabres, but during the course of the conflict the Sabres were upgraded to use the [[AIM-9B|AIM-9 Sidewinder]] air-to-air missile. This new weapon was used successfully to shoot down numerous Communist aircraft, starting its first combat experience on a good note. However, in late September 1958, a dud Sidewinder lodged itself in a MiG-17, which returned to base. The missile was successfully removed and eventually sent to the Soviet Union for reverse engineering. The result of this would be the very similar Vympel K-13 missile, entering service as the [[R-3S]] in 1962. The PLAAF would also license produce the K-13 as the [[PL-2]] some years later, bringing the Sidewinder into service on the other side of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nInformation is sparse on the fate of the MiG-17 afterwards. They were most likely supplanted by the domestically produced Shenyang J-5 version and eventually phased out of service upon the introduction of sufficient quantities of the superior MiG-19/[[J-6A|J-6]] and [[J-7II|J-7]].\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/285040-mikoyan-gurevich-mig-17/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Shenyang}}\n{{China jet aircraft}}"}}
