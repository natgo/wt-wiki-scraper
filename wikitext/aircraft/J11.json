The plane has a high top speed which can outrun most biplanes at its rank, when fully upgraded. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,200 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

The engine is almost twice as powerful compared to the [[J6B]] found before it, and the strong framework allows for even higher speeds, allowing the {{PAGENAME}} to chase down opponents in battle. Most importantly, however, is that the {{PAGENAME}} offers greater climb and energy retention, allowing for a bit more boom & zoom compared to other biplanes. The {{PAGENAME}} turns a bit worse than other biplanes, which is logical considering the powerful engine and heavy steel structure it features. This makes extended dogfights against other biplanes difficult, but should be avoidable by most {{PAGENAME}} players if speed is kept at an all-time high.\n\nOne large downside to this {{PAGENAME}} is the firepower. The Akan. m/40 are identical to the Italian guns found on the [[CR.42 (Family)|CR.42]]. Although the calibre is 12.7 mm, the Italian guns are quite lacklustre in performance due to the ammunition used. This requires the {{PAGENAME}} to put a lot of gun-time down compared to planes such as the [[J8A]], which is incredibly potent at dealing with biplanes. The guns are still have some tricks up their sleeve, especially when it comes to wing, and engine damage. The .50 cal ammunition can spread damage effectively, allowing for high wing-root damage, and the higher penetration and calibre size allows for additional damage to engine components, which are crucial at this BR.\n\n{{Notice|The landing brakes used by the {{PAGENAME}} are incredibly powerful and puts the plane at risk of nosing over due to the heavy engine. Make sure to gently tap the brakes at lower speeds, in order to prevent the plane from potentially crashing!}}\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

As World War 2 broke out, the Swedish air force felt the necessity to increase its air defence and yet due to the ban on exporting weapons and war machines during the war the Air force was relying on older and less capable fighters. When Italy showed interest in selling the Fiat C.R.42 the Air force placed an order of 120 planes and named the aircraft \"J11\". While the plane was mainly used as a fighter, it could also serve as a scout/recon vehicle. During the war the J11 was already outdated and could not withstand the superior German fighters and it was made with poor quality forcing most of the aircraft to become scrap metal. Today, few stand unharmed or restored and are located in aircraft museums around Sweden.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fiat_cr42_j11 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|rpp-GqXiaKg|'''The Shooting Range #214''' - ''Air Triathlon'' section at 09:59 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[C.R.42 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/445727-fiat-cr42/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [https://www.flygvapenmuseum.se/samlingar/flygplan/flygvapenmuseum-linkoping/j-11--fiat-c.r.42/ <nowiki>[flugvapenmuseum.se]</nowiki> J 11 - Fiat C.R.42]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Fiat}}\n{{Sweden fighters}}"}}
