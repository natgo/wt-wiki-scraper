As a twin-engine fighter/interceptor/attacker, it has the ability to remain in operation even flying on only one engine and with partial wing missing. While there is no real protection for its fuel tanks, it is less likely to catch fire when compared to other Japanese aircraft at its battle rating. If playing Realistic Battles, it is battle rating is slightly higher than arcade, but its forte is really in arcade battles at its battle rating. Its bomb load is relegated to smaller bomb sizes, but at the battle rating, it is enough to take out a few ground targets. The autocannons and machine guns on the aircraft are sufficient to perform strafing runs on lightly armoured vehicles. \n\nThe J1N1 flying low in AB can be a real distraction for the enemy team, keeping them away from the objectives of destroying ground targets. None of its weapons cannons is very powerful and its ammo count is quite low, but in arcade battles that is not much of a problem with in-flight reloadable ammunition when you run out. For quite a large aircraft, it is very manoeuvrable, and the \"ace up its sleeve\" is the rear-facing turrets, each with two 7.7 mm machine guns and unlike other fighters and bombers at its battle rating, the rear gunners are enclosed within the aircraft and not exposed to stray bullets. Enemy fighters on the tail of a J1N1 often find they suffer critical damage or are shot down while the offensive guns are trained on oncoming aircraft or ground targets. The playstyle is neither \"Boom & Zoom\" nor \"Turn & Burn\", but rather to fly low and drag the enemy onto the tail of the J1N1. In arcade battle, enemies will sometimes try to ram the J1N1, in an attempt to knock off a wing, but it will continue to fly, often losing only the wingtip. \n\nThis aircraft is less useful in realistic and simulator battles mainly due to its low ammo count, but the characteristic play style mentioned before could prove almost as rewarding and it can take quite a bit of punishment before being destroyed.\n\n===Manual Engine Control===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" |Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The main requirement for the aircraft was manoeuvrability and distance. It met the requirements on paper; however, due to the addition of rear-facing guns, the performance of the aircraft was hindered, as such the J1N's role of an escort fighter was scrapped.\n\nEquipped with two \"Nakajima NK1F Sakae 21\" 14cylinder radial engine's producing 1,130 horsepower each. It had a maximum range of 3,780 km (2,350 mi) if stripped of all weapons. This made it ideal for reconnaissance and was used for recon. During the beginning of the war with the Allies, the J1N was perfect for its reconnaissance role; however, when the war started favouring night attacks, the J1N was no longer equipped to serve its role.\n\nJapanese Commander Yasuna Kozono noticed the plane could not serve as a nighttime recon, he equipped two upwards firing 20 mm Type 99 cannons. Upon the new variants first sortie it downed two American bombers by flying under them and firing on the unsuspecting bomber crew. This success was immediately noticed by the Japanese Military and ordered Nakajima (the developers of the plane) to produce night fighting variants. \n\nAt first, the J1N night fighters were equipped with a spotlight on the nose, but when the Japanese developed a radar it saw extreme success. The American Military did not think the Japanese were capable of building a night fighter, leading to the destruction of many B-17's.\n\nThe J1N would have many variants designed for intercepting bombers and would be seen throughout the war. With the Allies use of the B-29 at the end of the war, the J1N could no longer out the Ally bombers. The J1N's success slowly started to fade, but some extremely skilful pilots such as Sachio Endo were still capable of downing many B-29's despite their plane being vastly outdated in 1945.\n\n479 J1Ns were built, with only 1 surviving the war. The surviving aircraft can be found at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, in Virginia USA.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=j1n1_mod11_early Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/331467-j1n1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Nakajima}}\n{{Japan twin-engine fighters and attackers}}"}}
