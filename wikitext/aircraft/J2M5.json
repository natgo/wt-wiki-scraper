Wielding four 20 mm cannons, this aircraft is more than capable of dealing with heavy damage. However, the main advantage the Raiden has over its Allied counterparts is its climb rate. In Realistic Battles, the J2M5 can climb to higher altitudes very quickly, especially when given an air start. This facet of the Raiden's performance is particularly exemplified in the J2M5, the last in-game variant of the Raiden that features the greatest performance of the series. This is partially due to its mechanically-driven supercharger which allows the J2M5 to perform at altitudes once thought impossible by Japanese engineers. Once at a high altitude, it becomes possible to choose when, where, and who the J2M5 want to fight. The J2M5's 20 mm cannons may initially seem rather lacklustre but they have a knack for snapshots or quick bursts of fire that result in a victory while manoeuvring. Generally, the J2M5 performs similarly to the early [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190 A variants]], having a deadly armament, good roll rate, low top speed, but higher climb rate. The J2M5 differs from this rule slightly as it was built for speed and high-altitude performance. The Raiden is best used as an energy fighter - instead of \"turning and burning\", or losing all built up speed in turns, attack enemies from a higher altitude and then regain that altitude once the attack has been delivered. The J2M5 excels at Boom & Zoom due to its high rate of climb, deadly armament, and high altitude characteristics.\n\nSharing this role with other \"energy fighters\" such as the [[Fw_190_D-13|Fw 190 D-13]] the Raiden's main downside is its lack of manoeuvrability. Similar to its earlier mentioned German counterpart, the Raiden struggles to beat enemies in turn fights, especially Spitfires. If caught in a sticky situation, the Raiden pilot may choose to dive away or seek help from teammates. Trying to fight an enemy Spitfire in a turn battle with any J2M is a terrible idea unless the enemy aircraft is damaged or many teammates are nearby. Moreover, the J2M's high-speed manoeuvrability is very poor; often, it becomes a gamble when pulling out of a high-speed dive as the Raiden's elevator authority at high speeds is lacking. The entire aircraft locks up at excess speeds of 645 KPH/400 MPH. It can be very difficult to pull out of a dive, roll, or turn when at high speeds with the J2M. The Raiden's manoeuvrability is more or less on par with its enemies in simulator battles, for the most part.\n\nThe Raiden pilot may also find themselves outclassed at extreme altitudes by aircraft such as the [[Ta_152_H-1|Ta 152]]. All these aircraft have to do to avoid the J2M5 is dive away and build up speed. Fortunately, this aircraft has a surprise - a massive ammunition pool totalling 800 rounds. With good aim and practice, it is possible to \"snipe\" enemies from upwards of a kilometre away.\n\nThe J2M5 wields two 20 mm Type 99 Mk. 1 cannon and two 20 mm Type 99 Mk. 2 cannons in the wings. The stock belts are particularly lacklustre for both of these weapons but since there is such a large amount of ammunition carried in both the effect is virtually negated. The \"Stealth\" belt has the best combination of AP/API and HEF to shred enemy aircraft, and are recommended for those who do not need a tracer shell to aim. Alternatively, for those not used to IJN 20 mm, the \"Universal\" belt is the best bet. The \"Tracers\" belt is filled with HEF-T shells, but they only contain half of the power of a standard HEF and can give away the plane's position.\n\nOverall, the Raiden is best used as a surprise attack, high altitude, high damage output fighter. Where it lacks in the manoeuvrability category, it makes up for in armament and rate of climb. The J2M5 also has improved cockpit visibility over the [[J2M2]] and [[J2M3]] variants.\n\nFor ground attack, the J2M5 can equip two 60 kg bombs  under the wings. While not the biggest, these bombs can help a team win a match, especially in arcade battles. The J2M5 can also wield armour-piercing ground targets ammunition for its 20 mm cannons, although 21 mm of penetration is nothing to boast about and should be ignored, unless targeting armoured personal carriers (APC) or similar armoured cars.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

With the J2M5, Raiden Model 33's a new and last engine revision was made, the Kasei 26a engine with a mechanically driven supercharger. This allowed the Model 33 to get higher speeds at higher altitudes compared to that of the [[J2M4 Kai|J2M4, Model 32]] at the cost of total range which was a sacrifice that was required as American bombers got closer and closer to the mainland.\n\nWithin the Model 33 there has been several prototype variants and armament configurations of only one becoming a production line variant, the J2M5a, Raiden Model 33 Ko which had four 20 mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons.\n\nOne other of these variants, the [[J2M5 30mm|J2M5 with Type 5 30 mm's]], which didn't make it to the production line, as by the time, bombers got through and bombed the Japanese logistics from December 1944 onward, which took its toll on the aircraft production overall.\n\nA direct hit on the Mitsubishi aircraft plant caused the complete loss of airframes, machine tools, and jigs and eventually halted production. Production generally suffered less from direct hits on factories, which were rare, but from attacks on suppliers and consequent shortages of material and construction tools.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=j2m5 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|KqLoa0NIpzE|'''The Shooting Range #178''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:36 discusses the J2M \"Raiden\".}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/249893-mitsubishi-j2m5/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mitsubishi}}\n{{Japan fighters}}"}}
