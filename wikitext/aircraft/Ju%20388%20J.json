Based on the Ju 188 and Ju 88, the aircraft was optimized for high-altitude operations to counter the formidable B-29 Superfortress; the aircraft incorporated specific design features for this role including a pressurized cockpit. However, the aircraft was plagued by technical issues and entered service late into the war, meaning that it saw little service.\n\nIn late 1942, the German Air Ministry (or RLM) first learned of the American B-29 Superfortress, which would've been capable of cruising such a high altitude (8000-10000 metres) that no German aircraft could counter it effectively. As a result, the RLM authorized the development of several new aircraft to counter the Superfortress, including the Ta 152 H. For the bomber destroyer role, several aircraft were considered including the Do 335, Ta 152 and He 219: the He 219 and Ta 152 weren't optimized for high-altitude flight and were subsequently not considered, while the Do 335 was still in a prototype stage with production models not expected until 1944.\n\nAs a result, the RLM authorized the development of the Ju 388, based on the airframe of the Ju 188 fast-bomber, which was in turn based on the Ju 88. Compared to the Ju 188, the Ju 388 featured numerous changes, including the removal of most defensive armament; instead, a pair of 13 mm machine guns were mounted in the tail, remotely controlled from the crew cabin. The Ju 388 K and L (the bomber and reconnaissance versions) retained the glazed nose of the Ju 188, while the Ju 388 J featured a solid nose housing two 20 mm MG 151/20 and two 30 mm MK 108 cannons.\n\nThe Ju 388 first entered service in 1944; roughly 100 Ju 388 aircraft of all models were built in total (the exact number is not known). However, only three Ju 388 J aircraft were completed. The aircraft were used against allied bombers in WW2, and were also proposed for export to Japan. Following the end of the war, a single Ju 388 L was acquired by the USAF for testing purposes - this aircraft is now stored at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, and is the only Ju 388 still intact today.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6138-development-junkers-ju-388-j-the-high-altitude-marauder-en|Devblog]] ===\nAfter the German Ministry of Aviation (RLM) found out about the new American B-29 Superfortress in 1942, serious concerns were raised among high ranking officials, questioning the Luftwaffe's ability to deal with such a new potential threat. At the time, the B-29 flew higher and faster than any fighter the Luftwaffe had at their disposal and the only weapon that could effectively counter it was the 12.8cm FlaK 40 heavy AA cannon. This led to the development of a range of new German high-altitude fighters, interceptors and dedicated bomber hunters.\n\nThe first prototype of the Ju 388 performed its maiden flight in December 1943, showing promising results. After the construction and testing of six further prototypes were completed in three modifications: the Ju 388J high-altitude interceptor, a Ju 388K medium bomber and the Ju 388L scout. The Ju 388 was ordered into production and was officially introduced into Luftwaffe service in summer 1944. However, initial production progressed at a slow pace due to the limited availability of the required engines for the aircraft. Furthermore, the continuously worsening war conditions in Germany had a severe impact on overall production, eventually preventing it entirely by the end of the war.\n\nIn the end, only around 100 Ju 388s were built with most aircraft seeing only limited action during their short service life during the final stages of WW2.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ju-388j Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ju 388J WTWallpaper 001.jpg\nFile:Ju 388J WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:Ju 388J WTWallpaper 003.jpg\nFile:Ju 388J WTWallpaper 004.jpg\nFile:Ju 388J WTWallpaper 005.jpg\nFile:Ju 388J WTWallpaper 007.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|gFJBLbLH6dY|'''Massive Off-centered FirePower! {{PAGENAME}} Review''' - ''Jengar''|yWWFv8qY5rQ|'''Battlefield Engineer: all new vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 6:44 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6138-development-junkers-ju-388-j-the-high-altitude-marauder-en|[Development] Junkers Ju 388 J: The High-Altitude Marauder]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/453804-ju-388j-0/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Junkers}}\n{{Germany twin-engine fighters}}\n{{Germany premium aircraft}}"}}
