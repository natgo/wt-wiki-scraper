In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]].\n\nThe Italian version of the [[Ju 87 R-2]] is quite similar to the German version, with some minor differences in terms of speed and flight performance. Additionally, the Italian version has different payload options as it carries different types of bombs. So it cannot carry the 1,000 kg bomb but it can carry some 50 kg bombs underneath the wings. It has 2 x 7.92 mm offensive machine guns and a single 7.92 mm machine gun in a dorsal turret operated by the gunner. Although this seems unimpressive, this armament is on par with most fighters at its rank and the rear MG, even with its blind spots, its decent enough to shake off some fighters.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Ju 87 R-2 isn't very manoeuvrable with bombs attached, but it can dance with a fighter in an emergency if it has the energy and has dropped the bombs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,100 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Dive-bomber'''\n\nThe main use of this aircraft is to attack ground targets. \"soft\" targets such AA emplacements, howitzers, artillery, trucks, and light armoured cars can be destroyed with the forward-firing 7.92 mm MGs, and you can destroy heavier ground targets with bombs such as pillboxes, and AI or player controlled tanks. It can carry a max of 1 x 500 kg bombs + 4 x 50 kg in 3 drops, two of the 50 kg bombs (that drop in pairs) and a single 500 kg drop. The two drops of the 50 kg bombs drop without delay, but the 500 kg bomb sits on a pair of arms that take the bomb outwards and then drops. This means that there is a little delay between the trigger and the bomb release, so keep in mind that you have to drop the bomb a bit earlier and keep going in the same trajectory.\n\n'''Fighter'''\n\nThe Ju-87 R-2 can be a decently manoeuvrable once the bombs have been dropped, and as it usually faces biplanes, the armament of two low-calibre guns is not really underwhelming. As soon as the match starts drop the bombs and climb at 220 km/h, because of the air-spawn you will be higher than most fighters, and then you can boom and zoom them. This tactic benefits greatly from flying with a squad.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!
