In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe Ju 88A-4 is very diverse with the ability to dive bomb and regularly bomb with large payloads. Its defensive armament is a little disappointing, but the two backwards-facing heavy machine guns can deal with light planes very quickly. However, the front is only covered by a light machine gun. Overall, the Ju 88 A-4 is a decent attack aircraft and fantastic fast medium bomber.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nWith great payloads and great speed, the Ju 88 A-4 can be a fun aircraft to play, whether you are playing in Ground Battles or Air Battles.\n\nIf you are playing in Air Realistic, you can go base bombing or attack other targets, like light pillboxes, howitzers and AAA. To attack bases, the best payload would be the SC50JA x 28 and SC500K x 2. This payload is quite useful, as it can take out 3 bases and even lightly damage the airfield. For attacking ground targets, you can either load the SC 50JA x 28 or SC250JA x 4. \n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Ju 88 high-speed horizontal and dive bomber was one of the most versatile aircraft of WWII, and the Ju 88A-4 was the most well-known and highly mass produced of all the variants. Unlike its predecessors, the plane had a new 1,400 PS engine, letting the bomber move around at high speed. After experiencing difficulties in the Battle of Britain, the aircraft received additional metal sheeting in the cockpit walls and floor, as well as an armoured pilot's seat, shielding the pilot's back and sides. New MG 81 belt-fed machine guns replaced the older MG 15s that had previously been fitted. The increased aircraft mass also necessitated stronger landing gear with a bigger wheel diameter.\n\nThe Ju 88A-4 was used against the Soviet Union in their maiden flights, and remained in the ranks until the end of the war. During WWII, nearly 15,000 Ju 88 bombers were built in different variations.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/504133-ju-88a-4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Junkers}}\n{{Germany bombers}}"}}
