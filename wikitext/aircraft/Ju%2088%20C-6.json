If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nBombers are often the main target for Ju 88 pilots. They can be easily caught and disposed of with the powerful cannons. Luckily, many bombers at this BR have only light machine guns as defensive armament, making them easy targets and not particularly threatening. However, there are some exceptions.\n\n'''[[Beaufort Mk VIII]]''' - The Beaufort is fast and has a powerful twin .50 cal turret at the back. This can engage you at long range and cause serious damage to your aircraft. Try to approach it from underneath or in a head on, a blind spot for the defensive .50 cal turret.\n\n'''[[B-34]]''' - Same as the Beaufort, it has a powerful turret with twin .50 cals. Approaching from behind is very dangerous. This aircraft also has good offensive armament, so approaching from the front is dangerous too. The best option is to hit it from underneath.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Under this idea, several Ju 88 C with specially enhanced forward firing firepower were produced for demonstration. Satisfied with the results of the early tests, the RLM ordered a small field test, and on 21 February 1940 KG30 received a batch of Ju 88 C-2s to form an additional squadron of evicters.\n\nIn the report submitted to the RLM, the performance and role of Ju 88 C were fully affirmed. The squadron leader pointed out that its excellent handling, long range and ability to attack under bad weather conditions were fully competent for the role positioning of the evictor, which was enough to pose a serious threat to enemy bombers. It was suggested that Ju 88 C be put into formal production and used on a large scale. However, in response to the opening of the British night bombing, the squadron was adapted into a night fighting unit.\n\nAfter a long wait, the opportunity finally came. Although the British decimated the French Navy in Operation Crossbow to save her from falling into German hands, the U-boat pack can now launch a crushing battle from the west coast of France, and they will be more deadly than their predecessors in the last Great war. For the first two years of the war, the Air Force used the Fw 200 to support U-boat operations, but with the escalation of war intensity, the firepower and mobility of the Fw 200 were insufficient, and the range of the Bf 110 and Fw 190 was insufficient to support deep ocean operations, so the Luftwaffe began to use the Ju 88 C-6.\n\nAfter a series of complicated preparation and reorganization, the Fifth KG40 Brigade using Ju 88 C-6 was formally established in July 1942. Compared with the previous Ju 88 C-2, the C-6 changed the engine to improve the speed and maneuverability, and the forward fire and self-defense firepower were also further improved. Perfect for deep ocean hunting Allied anti-submarine aircraft and bombers.\n\nOver a period of two years, the battalion achieved a total of 109 confirmed and 3 probable victories, at the cost of 91 Ju 88s lost in action, 30 lost to mechanical problems, bad weather or unknown causes, 222 killed or missing, 58 killed in accidents, 7 captured, 51 wounded, and more than 100 wounded. These results were pitiful compared with those of the single-engine fighter units, especially on the Eastern Front, and were almost forgotten after the war, but the battalion was originally set up to support U-boat operations and did its best to do so.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ju-88c-6 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|XOorKLj5YS0|'''Realistic: Ju 88 C-6 [Fun Factor]''' - ''Jengar''|06tPBcU97Cs|'''(Arcade): Ju 88 C-6 - Silent Night''' - ''tx141TX''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341954-ju-88c-6/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Junkers}}\n{{Germany twin-engine fighters}}"}}
