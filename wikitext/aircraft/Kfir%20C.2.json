To eliminate these concerns, the engineers proposed equipping the fighter with canards in the air intake areas, as well as installing aerodynamic ridges to redirect the airstream from the nose and provide a vortex around the canards. A dogtooth appeared on the leading edge of the wing that was intended to increase the lateral stability of the aircraft at high angles of attack. As a result, maneuverability at low speeds increased, and takeoff and landing runs became shorter. In addition, the new Kfir modification also received two additional weapon suspension hardpoints. The modification of the fighter with canards entered service with the Israeli Air Force in 1977 under the designation Kfir C.2, in addition to new machines, most Kfirs from the first production series were upgraded to the C.2 level. Aside from Israel, Kfir C.2 was in service with the armies of Colombia, Ecuador and Sri Lanka.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=kfir_c2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nKfir_C.2_WTWallpaper001.jpg\nKfir_C.2_WTWallpaper002.jpg\nKfir_C.2_WTWallpaper003.jpg\nKfir_C.2_WTWallpaper004.jpg\nKfir_C.2_WTWallpaper005.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Mirage 5 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7637-development-battle-for-arachis-kfir-c-2-en|[Devblog] \"Battle for Arachis\": Kfir C.2]]\n\n{{Manufacturer IAI}}\n{{Israel jet aircraft}}"}}
