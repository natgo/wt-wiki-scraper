In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Winged Lions\"]].\n\nThe IAI Kfir is a Israeli development of the [[Nesher]], itself a variant of the French [[Mirage 5 (Family)|Mirage 5]]. The delta-winged Mirages are known for their low wing loading and sleek aerodynamics, but their engines tend to be underwhelming. The Kfir rectifies this with an American J79 engine as seen on the [[F-4 Phantom II (Family)|F-4 Phantom]] and [[F-104 (Family)|F-104 Starfighter]], which offers vastly more thrust, and fixed canard foreplanes mounted on the air intakes to compensate for the weight changes. The end result is an aircraft with incredible acceleration and high agility, a dangerous opponent in dogfights.\n\nThe Kfir's weapons leave something to be desired, reflecting its real-life usage as a basic fighter-bomber. It can carry an impressive payload of bombs and rockets but lacks radar-guided missiles for BVR combat. Its best dogfight missile is the [[AIM-9G Sidewinder]], which is less manoeuvrable than the contemporary [[R-60]] and [[R.550|Matra Magic]] for example. It also does not have guided air-to-ground weapons used by the [[F-4E Phantom II (Israel)|Israeli F-4E]]. Thus, the Kfir requires a skilled pilot to take advantage of its excellent performance to win engagements.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Kfir C.7 has an impressive acceleration, even higher then the [[MiG-23MLD]]'s. The plane can also turn quite well, but it is not recommended to turn while in combat as the delta wing configuration will bleed a lot of speed and a slow jet is an easy target. However, you can take the risk to bleed speed in some situations since you regain that speed rather quickly.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 10,668 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Israel funded a large part of the project by purchasing a total of 50 aircraft in advance of their production. The deal eventually fell through when France enacted an arms embargo on Israel following its preemptive strike at the start of the 1967 Six-Day War - an action that the French had explicitly warned Israel not to take. Though Israel was eventually reimbursed for its payments, the Mirage 5 was never supplied.\n\nTo circumvent the embargo, Israel collaborated with the Dassault Aviation company to smuggle blueprints and materials out of France to construct their own copy of the Mirage 5 - the [[Nesher|IAI Nesher]]. One of the most successful air superiority fighters of all time, the Nesher scored a staggering 111:3 kill ratio during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. This not only proved the merits of the Mirage 5's design, but also proved that Israel was now capable of manufacturing warplanes locally. This fact was of utmost importance to the Israelis: up until that point they had been completely dependent on the French to supply their aircraft, and were now left orphaned due to the embargo.\n\nThanks to a gradual warming of relations with the United States, the IAF could begin arming itself with [[A-4H (Israel)|A-4H]] and [[F-4E Phantom II (Israel)|F-4E Phantom II]] jets, which served mostly as ground attackers; but neither could replace the Nesher as an air superiority fighter. With the looming threat of more advanced Soviet fighters entering service in the Arab air forces, Israel was keenly aware that the Nesher could not remain the top dog for long. Israel's response to this threat was to begin development of an advanced fighter jet based on the Mirage 5 design - one that could be manufactured ''from scratch'' in Israel.\n\nA major factor in the design of the new plane was its engine. Israel had already acquired a license to produce the powerful General Electric J79 turbojet - the engine used in the F-4E. Thus, it was decided that the new Mirage 5 variant would be built entirely around this engine. This required several major changes to the airframe, primarily a redesign of the fuselage and enlargement of the air intakes (even adding a small cooling intake in the tail). As per their usual doctrine, the Israelis also installed a completely new advanced avionics package into the cockpit, altering it significantly. Another, more noticeable feature was the addition of two small canards on either side of the intakes.\n\nThe resulting aircraft, the ''IAI Kfir'' (\"Lion Cub\"), entered service in 1975. However, its primacy in the IAF was supplanted almost immediately by the arrival of the first F-15s in late 1976, and later by the F-16s. The Kfir was therefore relegated to a fighter-bomber role during the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\nThe Kfir C.7, being the third and most advanced variant of the Kfir in IAF service, was designed to fit the aircraft's new role \"underneath\" the F-15 and F-16. It was built more robustly, and carried a stronger version of the J79 engine that could help it take off with a heavier payload. It had additional hardpoints for carrying extra munitions, and much larger canards than the original design. All Kfir C.7s were in fact upgraded Kfir C.2s, rather than brand new planes.\n\nDespite being originally designed as an air superiority jet, the Kfir only scored a single aerial kill throughout its service in the IAF. Its last action in the IAF occurred during the 1993 Operation Accountability, after which it was gradually removed from service. An export version of the plane, however, was sold to Colombia, Ecuador and Sri Lanka, and still serves in their air forces in 2021, with constant upgrades. The plane took part in combat once again during the (1983-2009) Sri Lankan Civil War from 1996 after introducing the Kfir to it's Air Force.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/7466-development-kfir-c-7-the-sharp-clawed-lion-cub-en|Devblog]] ===\nImmediately after the Six-Day-War, France imposed an arms export embargo on Israel, acutely highlighting the nation's dependence on foreign suppliers of military equipment. Despite the embargo, Israel managed to obtain documentation for the Mirage 5J version, which was developed specifically for the Israeli Air Force before the ban. These aircraft were produced commercially under the name IAI Nesher. But due to the end of supplies from France, Israel turned to the U.S. for assistance, procuring a number of new F-4 Phantom II and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft for its air force. However, when the air force compared the Nesher with the new F-4 Phantom, it realized that the Mirage was falling behind in several aspects. Therefore, plans to outfit Neshers with licence-built Phantom II engines - the General Electric J79 - were drawn up and soon afterward realized with the Kfir (Hebrew for \"Lion Cub\").\n\nEntering serial production in 1975 and subsequently being commissioned into service with the 101st, 113th and 109th squadrons of the Israeli Air Force, the Kfir first saw combat action in November 1977. While the aircraft performed well and was also well-liked by its pilots, the modification did increase the weight of the aircraft, negatively impacting some of its flight characteristics. Israeli engineers solved the issue by outfitting the Kfir with fixed canards on the forward section of the fuselage.\n\nThe Kfir C.7 is a later modification of the aircraft, resulting from continuous efforts of Israeli engineers to further develop the Kfir. The new version featured numerous improvements, including a more powerful afterburner, increased payload and weapon selection as well as new avionics and cockpit arrangement. The Kfir C.7 entered service in 1983 and would remain in active service until the early 1990s before being officially decommissioned by the Israeli Air Force. Subsequently, some units were sold on the export market to Columbia and Sri Lanka where they saw active combat during the Sri Lankan Civil War.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=kfir_c7 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|ERLptF1Nsps|'''The Shooting Range #286''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:36 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Mirage 5 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7466-development-kfir-c-7-the-sharp-clawed-lion-cub-en|[Devblog] Kfir C.7: The Sharp-Clawed Lion Cub]]\n\n{{Manufacturer IAI}}\n{{Israel jet aircraft}}"}}
