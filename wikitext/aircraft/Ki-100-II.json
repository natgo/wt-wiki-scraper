If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nPilots of the standard Ki-100 found in the tech tree should feel relatively comfortable in the premium Ki-100-II. This aircraft offers balanced performance characteristics that allow the pilot to choose how he wishes to fight in the Ki-100-II and adapt to the combat situation as necessary. The performance of the Ki-100-II is characterized by decent climb rate and manoeuvrability. The aircraft has good (but not the best) acceleration in a dive that makes it suitable for short range \"boom and zoom\" style attacks. The pilot should position the fighter around 1000 meters above a selected target, dive rapidly, fire a quick burst, and then pull away in a shallow climb to hold the plane's speed and escape. This is the safest way to conduct combat in the Ki-100-II, but there are other options available.\n\nAgainst less manoeuvrable opponents, turn fighting can be a valid approach. Most German and American aircraft will not be able to out-turn you. However, turning combat is only advised when there are no other enemies around that could pounce on you while you are focused on your target. Do not manoeuvre for too long and avoid getting too slow, because your control surfaces will become less responsive. Then you will be a sitting duck for most other fighters.\n\nWith sufficient speed, the Ki-100-II also has suitable energy retention characteristics for spiral climbs and other moves that can drain your opponent's energy. However, there are other fighters which are still superior in this regard.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In October of 1944, the decision was made to fit 3 Ki-61s with Ha-112 radial engines, which were lighter and more reliable then the Ha-140 inline engine that the Ki-61 used. On February 1, 1945, the modified Ki-61 made its first flight, where it performed well. Continued testing throughout March and April proved that it outperformed the Ki-84, then considered the best fighter in the IJAAF's operation. In March 1945, because of its favourable performance, coupled with its much more reliable engine, it was ordered into production and given the Ki-100 designation. It began combat service on March 9, and was used mainly for its intended purpose until the Japanese surrender in 1945. A total of 396 were built.\n\nThe Ki-100-II was a prototype version of the Ki-100, built to improve its high altitude performance in order to improve interception capabilities against high flying American B-29s. It replaced the Ki-100's regular engine with a turbocharged, water-methanol injected one that enhanced performance above 8 kilometres. Ultimately, only 3 were built, with none of them ever seeing combat.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ki_100_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341962-ki-100-ii/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kawasaki}}\n{{Japan fighters}}\n{{Japan premium aircraft}}"}}
