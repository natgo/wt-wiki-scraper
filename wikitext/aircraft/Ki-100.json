Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis aircraft offers balanced performance characteristics that allow the pilot to choose how one wishes to fight in the Ki-100 and adapt to the combat situation as necessary. The performance of the Ki-100 is characterised by decent climb rate and manoeuvrability. The aircraft has good (but not the best) acceleration in a dive that makes it suitable for short range \"boom and zoom\" style attacks. The pilot should position the fighter around 1,000 m above a selected target, dive rapidly, fire a quick burst, and then pull away in a shallow climb to hold the plane's speed and escape. This is the safest way to conduct combat in the Ki-100, but there are other options available.\n\nAgainst less manoeuvrable opponents, turn fighting can be a valid approach. Most German and American aircraft will not be able to out-turn you. However, turning combat is only advised when there are no other enemies around that could pounce on you while you are focused on your target. Do not manoeuvre for too long and avoid getting too slow, because your control surfaces will become less responsive. Then you will be a sitting duck for most other fighters.\n\nWith sufficient speed, the Ki-100 also has suitable energy retention characteristics for spiral climbs and other moves that can drain your opponent's energy. However, there are other fighters which are still superior in this regard.\n\nInterceptors/Air defence: In higher altitudes you should be aware of this types of airplanes. They have good climb rate and speed but they are not very nimble. They will most likely try to head-on you and then run away. You can use nimble characteristics of your airplane to avoid this kind of attack. Most of them will not try to turn fight with you and you cant compete with your performance.\n\nBombers: You should avoid this kind of airplanes in higher altitudes or at least not engage them alone at start of match. Your low velocity cannons are not good enough for long range approach and going closer to them is dangerous gamble as Ki-100 is very fragile and vulnerable to fires.\n\nFighters: Thanks to your climb rate you will most of the time end up above them. That gives you very good opportunity for BnZ tactics. You should look after fighter that end up separated or those who are too focused chasing some of your teammates. This airplane also allow you to dog fight some of them but you should not end up in dog fight with lots of enemies since even small dose of fire can noticeably damage you. Low velocity armament also need skilled pilot against nimble opponents or in dog fights.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In October of 1944, the decision was made to fit 3 Ki-61s with Ha-112 radial engines, which were lighter and more reliable then the Ha-140 inline engine that the Ki-61 used. On February 1, 1945, the modified Ki-61 made its first flight, where it performed well. Continued testing throughout March and April proved that it outperformed the Ki-84, then considered the best fighter in the IJAAF's operation. In March 1945, because of its favourable performance, coupled with its much more reliable engine, it was ordered into production and given the Ki-100 designation. It began combat service on March 9, and was used mainly for its intended purpose until the Japanese surrender in 1945. A total of 396 were built.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ki_100_early Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|p_5R0hfDE_k|'''Ki 100 - Tactics and Strategies [aiming]''' - ''Green Fury''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/325046-ki-100-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kawasaki}}\n{{Japan fighters}}"}}
