{"title":"Ki-102 otsu","pageid":587,"wikitext":{"*":"{{Specs-Card\n|code=ki_102_otsu\n|images={{Specs-Card-Image|GarageImage_{{PAGENAME}}.jpg|ArtImage_{{PAGENAME}}.png}}\n}}\n\n== Description ==\n<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Designated: Type 4 Assault Aircraft) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.35]]. The Allied reporting name for this aircraft was \"Randy\".\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} was a ground attacker version of the Ki-102 which in itself was a variant of the [[Ki-45 (Family)|Ki-45]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has a decent speed advantage over most enemy planes in a straight line or dive and very good climb rate. The climb rate is typically better than almost every aircraft it will come up against. As with most Japanese heavy fighters, it is a very fast aircraft. The aircraft is as manoeuvrable as you would expect from a heavy fighter, though quite sluggish in a turn compared to a single engine aircraft. The {{PAGENAME}} has good acceleration in a dive due to its two powerful engines and increased weight and decent acceleration when travelling in a straight line.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 1,900 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Ho-401 (57 mm)|Ho-5 (20 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 1 x 57 mm Ho-401 cannon, nose-mounted (16 rpg)\n* 2 x 20 mm Ho-5 cannons, chin-mounted (200 rpg = 400 total)\n\nAs a ground attacker, the {{PAGENAME}} comes equipped with a 57 mm drum-loaded cannon to engage ground targets with but lacks shell choice and comes only with HE. The gun itself was based on the [[Ho-203 (37 mm)]] but increased in size. It lacks velocity and requires the pilot to be rather close to the target to hit anything at all which will make this plane very vulnerable when an attack is initiated.\n\nAlong with the Ho-401, it also comes with 2 x 20 mm Ho-5s which provide some good firepower for aerial targets and lightly armoured vehicles at a range unlike the Ho-401.\n\nIt is greatly advised to fire the guns separated.\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Ho-104 (12.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Ho-104 machine gun, dorsal turret (500 rpg)\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has a 12.7 mm Ho-104 in the back, which shouldn't be underestimated as it can leave the pursuer burning down to the ground, but the belts for it aren't very favourable as most of them are filled with AP. Universal offers the best single bullet but is only fired every 4 rounds and Default offers a better universality.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Powerful 57 mm cannon\n* Self-sealing fuel tanks and decent survivability, unlike many Japanese aircraft\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Weak defensive armament\n* Rather slow for its BR\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
