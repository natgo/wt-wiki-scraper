It was introduced during [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]] as a reward vehicle for the [[wt:en/news/4416-special-war-thunder-winter-holiday-en|2016 \"Winter Holiday\"]] event. It was later made available as a battle trophy vehicle in the Warbond shop from the [[Battle Pass: Season I, 75th Anniversary of the Great Victory]] until the end of the [[Battle Pass: Season IV, \"Fearless Voltigeur\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe main difference between the [[Ki-21-Ia]] and this Ki-21-Ic is armament, 2 x Te-1s compared to 7 x Te-1s which are simply the best 7.7 mm Japan can offer, with a rate of fire of  950 rpm, API - IT belts in the universal belt which do a lot of damage and covers the whole plane.\n\nIf attacked by fighters, it is important to remember and recognize the Ki-21's turning capabilities. It is actually possible to win lateral turn fights against fighters with this aircraft as she is one of the most manoeuvrable bombers if not the most manoeuvrable bomber in game.\n\nThis aircraft has the ability to hold up to 1,000 kg of bombs in several different variations: 20 x 50 kg, 10 x 100 kg, 4x 250 kg, and 2 x 500 kg. Use the 20 x 50 kg or 10 x 100 kg bombs to attack light tanks and light pillboxes. They are not viable against bigger targets, since direct hits are needed to destroy. This loadout is particularly useful on maps that have an abundance of non-moving targets (light pillboxes) or lightly armoured targets (armoured cars or AA trucks for example). Use either of the 4 x 250 kg or 2 x 500 kg payload to destroy heavier targets such as medium tanks, pillboxes, destroyers, and cargo ships.\n\nAlthough unconventional, this aircraft is a fantastic weapon if you want to bait the enemy. Ideally, you would want to attract a higher flying enemy down to you and to get into a turn fight. This way, depending on the enemy aircraft you can out manoeuvre and distract him while teammates fly down to finish him off.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Its cantilever wing was implanted in the middle position. The crew positions were largely glazed, providing good visibility for the five crewmen. The landing gear included two train legs fitting almost completely into the two engine nacelles, plus a non-retractable tailwheel. The two engines were Nakajima Ha-5 Kai, with unit power of 850 hp (1,000 hp at takeoff), each driving a three-bladed metal propeller with variable pitch. Serial production really began in 1938 in the Mitsubishi and Nakajima factories.\n\n'''Combat usage'''\n\nThe first available aircraft were engaged in China during Summer 1938, where they were well-received by the crews of the army. The first reports on the commitment of these planes enabled Mitsubishi to make changes, particularly in terms of armaments. This led to the development of new versions, such as Ki-21-Ib (乙, otsu) and finally Ki-21-Ic (丙, hei).\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ki_21_1hei Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/234534-mitsubishi-ki-21-i-kohei/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mitsubishi}}\n{{Japan bombers}}\n{{Winter Event}}\n{{Japan premium aircraft}}"}}
