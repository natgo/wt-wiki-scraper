In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThis aircraft is typical of Japanese fighter design: light armour and tight manoeuvrability. This aircraft can out-turn most other fighters of rank 1-2. It dances away from the line of fire with extreme agility, and can strike from high angles with ease.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.-->\n\nTypical of low-rank Japanese fighter design, this aircraft has no armour. Due to this, most calibres found in ranks 1 and 2 will make quick work of this plane. Don't let this sway you away from this plane, it makes up for its lack of armour with extreme manoeuvrability. The fuel tanks are not self-sealing. There are 2 in each wing, and a 5th one located close to the oil cooling system.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Type 89 army (7.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 2 x 7.7 mm Type 89 army machine guns, nose-mounted (500 rpg = 1,000 total)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB). -->\nA superior dogfighter for turn-fighting, the Ki-27 is the first plane to begin showing the features typical of the Japanese [[A6M2|\"Zero\"]] but with none of the bite. Its speed and manoeuvrability are plagued by engine problems, with no armour and a standard armament.\n\nIn battle, no Allied fighter can out-turn you, except for biplanes, but most will outgun you (and even most biplanes match the Ki-27 in armament).\n\nBiplanes (except the [[I-153 M-62|I-153 Chaika]]) make easy prey for the Ki-27, and the Ki-27 can easily outmanoeuvre the [[P-36C|P-36 Hawk]], the [[F2A-1|F2A Brewster Buffalo]] and the [[I-16 type 24|I-16 Ishak]], but their stronger armaments will knock out a Ki-27 in a single good burst. Simply outrunning any of them is an excellent evasive manoeuvre. [[Hurricane Mk I/L|Hurricane Mk Is]] can strictly complete with the Ki-27 Otsu in manoeuvrability, but the Hurricane's heavier armament (four times that of the Ki-27) can also quickly shred a Ki-27. Additionally, outrunning a Hurricane in a Ki-27 is not possible. [[I-15bis|I-15s]], which the Ki-27 historically outperformed, will be the bane of a Ki-27s existence, as their excellent turn ability will force it into energy bleeding manoeuvres or Boom & Zoom style combat. Risky with competition around to abuse either state.\n\nDespite its low battle rating, you can face some challenging foes when flying the Ki-27. Biplanes will give you a run for your money in terms of manoeuvrability, while some early monoplanes will be faster and more heavily armed than you. Therefore, it is important to judge your foes accordingly.\n\nOne of the most challenging opponents is the [[I-153 M-62|I-153 Chaika]]. It is not a mere upgraded [[I-15bis]], but in all performance aspects equal to the Nakajima Ki-27 fighter. Also on the Soviet side, the [[MiG-3 (Family)|MiG-3]] is a significant threat. It is one of the fastest aircraft in its battle rating and has decent armament. In skilled hands, it can be an almost impossible opponent to combat, especially when using Boom & Zoom tactics against you. Your only defence will be to try and outmanoeuvre it or to lure it into a turn fight. The I-16 is also a familiar opponent.\n\nFrom America, you will face the [[P-26 (Family)|P-26]]. They are quite good divers and have a decent roll rate, but will not be able to outmanoeuvre you in a turn fight. The [[P-36 (Family)|P-36]] is more challenging. Faster and well armed, you will have to rely on your turn rate to try and outmanoeuvre them.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Where they were being used as frontline fighters, the puppet regime of Manchukuo also used Ki-27 as their fighters after the Japanese retired them from frontline use after severe loss in Khalkhin Gol.\n\nThe remaining Ki-27 that survived the war were captured by both KMT and PLA forces, but due to the already outdated performance in regards to the latest fighters and lack of spare parts for repair, these aircraft and its trainer variant (Manshu Ki-79) were mostly used as a trainer for training new pilots, especially for the Chinese Red Army in Northeastern China, where those pilots were becoming the foundation of the new PLAAF.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ki-27_otsu_china Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/202077-nakajima-ki-27-otsu/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Nakajima}}\n{{China fighters}}"}}
