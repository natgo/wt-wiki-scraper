In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.31]].\n\nBeing a classed as a heavy fighter, the Ki-45 isn't the best in the manoeuvrability category. However, for a heavy fighter, it manoeuvres very well. It is even capable of out-turning aircraft such as the [[P-47D-25]]. Unlike heavy fighters of other nations, the Ki-45 series does not feature aircraft with large amounts of heavy weaponry. This is a major downside, considering how heavy fighters traditionally give up manoeuvrability and speed for armament. Instead, the Ki-45s utilize more of an equilibrium between manoeuvrability, speed, and armament. These are what makes the Ki-45 both a capable dog-fighter, and bomber hunter.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis variant of the Ki-45, the Ki-45 hei, features virtually the same armament as the [[Ki-45 otsu]]. Wielding one Ho-3 20 mm cannon and one Ho-203 37 mm cannon, the Ki-45 hei is the pinnacle of a multi-purpose aircraft. Its 37 mm cannon allows it to take down bombers with ease, and its single 20 mm cannon allows for some flexibility in the dog-fighting department. Although deadly, the 37 mm cannon only holds 15 rounds, so shot placement is crucial. The round itself also travels fairly slowly in the air, making it hard to hit fast moving enemy fighters. The 20 mm cannon is best used in an anti-fighter role. Unfortunately, the Ki-45's ground attack role is minimal due to the inability to equip armour piercing rounds for the 37 mm cannon. The Ki-45 hei is also unable to equip bombs.\n\nThe Ki-45 hei also retains its impressive turn rate from the [[Ki-45 tei]]. Although the aircraft itself is large and presents an \"easy target\" in many players' minds, the Ki-45 is rather nimble. Use this to your advantage when engaging enemy aircraft. Unfortunately, the Ki-45 is a heavy fighter, meaning its turn time is still not on par with other aircraft such as the [[F2A-3]]. In certain cases, the Ki-45 pilot may have to rely on his or her tail gunner to get the job done. The \"otsu\" version of the Ki-45 features a 7.92 mm Type 98 machine gun with 1050 rounds. Although lacklustre, with shot placement it is possible to destroy enemies on the aircraft's tail. Aim for the pilot or the engine, as those are generally the weakest points on most aircraft. If the tailing enemy is a bi-plane, aim for the wings since they are very fragile.\n\nThe Toryu is also rather fragile for a heavy fighter. Although it does feature two engines, the Ki-45 does not have very much armour protection. Only the back of the pilot's seat has armour, leaving both the gunner and engines unprotected. This can prove costly in a fight. If one does find him or herself tailed, call upon teammates for assistance.\n\n* In simulator, the Ki-45 has a decent frontal view with large pieces of glass in front, on top and to the sides, ensuring great visibility. The gunsight has enough room under, allowing easy tracking and leading of targets. However the side views are terrible as the wings & engines block out most of the view downwards, and a thick frame blocks out the upper area, as a result the common way of circling above an area to spot something is extremely limited. Rear visibility is almost non existent with the entire tail obstructed by the headset.\n\n====Tactics====\n<!--Specific methods of play in different situations, label the methods with pros and cons (if possible) based on vehicle's performances (i.e. Me 262 playing as a fighter or anti-bomber)-->\nThe Ki-45 hei's armament is much more suited for bomber hunting than its earlier machine gun armed variant. With a moderate ammunition pool, it is easily possible to destroy multiple enemies with this aircraft. It is recommended to use the 20 mm cannon only when the pilot is sure he or she will hit the enemy aircraft, as it only holds 100 shells. The 37 mm cannon does impressive damage but requires a high degree of accuracy and lead. Practising with this weapon will help greatly, especially when attacking fighters.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was found to be easily outclassed by P-40s piloted by the Flying Tigers. As a result, the Ki-45's role was changed to anti-shipping and ground attack, where it performed satisfactorily. Nonetheless, the Ki-45's greatest strength proved to be its bomber intercepting capabilities. Heavily armed with 37 mm cannon, the Toryu (Dragon Slayer) could destroy heavy bombers with ease. As the war progressed, the need for an interceptor to defend the Japanese mainland was ever present. Soon, the Ki-45 was deployed to counter B-29 Superfortress raids. Although its armament was clearly deadly enough, the Ki-45 suffered at high altitudes. Pilots soon resorted to ramming attacks against the Superfortresses. Special attack groups specifically designed for this purpose formed, but by late 1945 Imperial Japan's fate had been sealed. The Allies allocated the name \"Nick\" to the Ki-45.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nKawasaki Ki-45 KAI Hei (Model C) Type 2 Toryu (Allied reporting name: Nick) twin-engine army fighter\n\nThe Ki-45 KAI Hei variant, with modified on-board armament (when compared with the Ki-45 KAI Otsu), was specially created to attack sea targets.\n\nA 37 mm Ho-203 automatic cannon with 15 rounds was mounted in the nose fairing, which had its shape modified. A 20 mm Ho-3 cannon with 100 rounds was placed in the lower section of the fuselage.\n\nThe 7.92 mm Type 98 machine gun with 1,050 rounds remained in the rear defensive turret. In all other respects, the airframe was like that of the Ki-45 KAI Otsu.\n\nThe Ki-45 KAI Hei was extensively used in New Guinea, particularly against American torpedo boats.\n\nOne of the Ki-45 KAI Hei fighters was thoroughly tested in 1945 by US Army Technical Intelligence experts. The test results report mentioned the very good takeoff characteristics of the aircraft. Other capabilities won praise too: for example, the American pilots were struck by the machine's horizontal manoeuvrability. Stall characteristics were satisfactory, and pilots could sense when speed loss caused by flow separation was imminent. Landing performance was found to be very good, as well.\n\nObserved drawbacks included the aircraft's low taxi controllability due to poor breaks and the free-pivoting tail wheel. In addition, the aircraft's high nose-up position obscured forward visibility, so there was no choice but to taxi in a zigzag pattern.\n\nIn addition to that, the report mentioned significant noise and vibration levels in the cockpit at all speeds, unsatisfactory pilot seat adjustment, and poor downward and backward visibility from the pilot's cockpit.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ki-45_hei Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kawasaki}}\n{{Japan twin-engine fighters and attackers}}"}}
