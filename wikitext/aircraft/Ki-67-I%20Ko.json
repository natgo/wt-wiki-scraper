In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 \"Assault\"]].\n\nThe Ki-67 ko excels in many roles in which other Japanese bombers fail to live up to. This is one of the most formidable medium bombers out there, as it is fast, has great defensive capabilities, can mount a wide array of bombs and torpedoes, and has really good survivability. The Ki-67 ko has a wide variety of roles, but its main role is actually a frontline bomber, as it can destroy pillboxes and other high value ground units. Its payload isn't designed to target bases, so it is advisable to target individual ground targets. The Ki-67 ko differs from the previous model, the Ki-67 otsu, in rear of the aircraft. The Ki-67 ko has a single tail gun configuration, giving it slightly weaker defensive capabilities than the Ki-67 otsu.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe flight performance of this plane is extremely smooth. The Ki-67 can turn really well for a bomber. It has a high rip speed of around 650 km/h. It has excellent acceleration and speed as well, so it can outrun some pursuing fighters. The Ki-67 otsu performs identically to the Ki-67 Ko. It is also important to note that this aircraft is equipped with radial engines, which won't overheat under the WEP setting.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,150 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* 70 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen\n* 12.7 mm steel plate in the nose - protecting pilots\n* 15.8 mm steel plate pilot seat\n* 15.8 mm steel plate in mid fuselage - protecting dorsal gunner\n* 7.9 mm steel plate in tail (belly only)\n* Self sealing fuel tanks (in wings and mid fuselage)\n\nThe Ki-67 is one of the most sturdy Japanese aircraft in War Thunder. It has self sealing fuel tanks. It can take lots of punishment from .50 calibre rounds. However, when facing aircraft with cannons, it will quickly fall prey to HE rounds unless you take immediate evasive action.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n===Arcade Battles===\nThe Ki-67 can be used in Air Arcade battles to an excellent extent. It can use its bombs to effectively destroy multiple ground units, playing an important role in ticket count.\nTo start, take the eight 100 kg bombs and dive to the deck, stay away from the main group of fighters, as it is advisable to stay on the outside of the map to avoid fighter confrontation.\nNext, bomb any ground targets you see; tanks and pillboxes are killable only with direct hits, so use the manoeuvrability of this bomber to drop your bombs with precision. It isn't advised to drop bombs on bases, as your payload is not as big enough as that of Heavy bombers and will do very little damage.\n\n===Realistic Battles===\nThe Ki-67-I does well in the ground attack role, but due to limited bombs, you'll need to make frequent trips back to the base. The strategy here is to target pillboxes and medium tanks with the 250 kilogram bombs. Remember to set a three to two second fuse on those bombs!\nTo start, you'll need to head in for an attack run as fast as possible. Dive towards the ground targets and line up with the pillboxes.\nAfter dropping your four bombs, immediately return to the base, as enemy fighters will be closing in on you. Staying low is critical, as other fighters that dive in on you can be dragged lower to allow for allied interception. However, on certain Pacific maps, you'll need to take torpedoes. To effectively destroy the ships, you'll need to chose a target. At the start of the battle, note if your allies have equipped torpedoes. If no allies are present, head for the destroyers. They take one torpedo to kill. If multiple allies with torpedoes are present, communicate with your team to target the carriers. They are the most rewarding target to kill.\n\n;Enemies worth noting:\n\n* [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]] - The P-47 is one of the heavier single-engine fighters that can keep up with the Hiryu and most of your armament will do negligible damage to it. It will unleash eight .50 cals on your aircraft and make short work of you. To deal with this plane, turn. You can out-turn the P-47 and it will most likely disengage. If it keeps up with you, just make sure to manoeuvre out of its sprays and try to hit it with your 20 mm in the tail.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

They also come with a two-stage supercharger. The propeller pitch should be used at 90%-100% when on WEP. Lower the propeller pitch to 90% when at high speeds. The radiators can be kept at 10-20%, and the supercharger can be activated at 3.5 km (11k ft), and the mixture can be set to the following at each specific altitude:\n\n* Sea Level: 100%-110% Mixture\n* 3000 feet: 92% Mixture\n* 6000 feet: 84% Mixture\n* 1000 feet: 70% Mixture\n* 15000 feet: 60% Mixture\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
