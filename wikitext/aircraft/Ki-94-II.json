Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThere is limited armour protection for the pilot and other modules, but the coverage is not high. All the main modules - engine, fuel tanks, oil coolers - are located in the front of the fuselage and the inner part of the wings. This means the modules would likely absorb bullets coming from the front before they could harm the pilot, but the aircraft would likely be crippled after that. From the rear there are no major modules, but that also leaves the pilot very vulnerable from the rear.\n\n* 70 mm Bulletproof glass - Armoured windscreen\n* 8.5 mm Steel plate in the nose, behind engine\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Tachikawa Ki-94-II should be used as a Boom & Zoomer and a Boom & Runner depending on the situation. The Ki-94-II should be above all enemy aircraft in order to Boom & Zoom. When used as a Boom & Zoomer, set the throttle to 20%-50%. The reason behind that is the Ki-94-II's engine response to throttle change from 0% to 100% or WEP is poor, it takes 5 seconds or more for the engine to go back to full power which can be a leave the plane really vulnerable if you're trying to climbing back to altitude without engine power. If you meet players at your height, that's when Boom & Run comes into place. After going head-on with them (if you do), do not turn back to them. Level your plane out and keep flying straight to gain speed and keep doing that until the enemy pilot turns away. After that, climb more then resume Boom & Zoom.\n\nThe Ki-94-II has a powerful engine, producing up to 2,440 hp in-game. It has long wings which resemble the ones of the Ta 152. The Ki-94-II's elevator is very responsive at 500-700 km/h which is impressive for a prop aircraft. However, the climb rate of the Ki-94-II is abysmal without modifications. With all modifications, it can climb with P-47s. The Ki-94-II is a durable plane, it can take quite a few hits to its airframe without dying immediately. However, the fuel tanks are not well-protected, so expect them to get lit on fire fairly easily.\n\nThe Ki-94-II's main role is bomber intercepting but it can also be used as a fighter. As said earlier, the Ki-94-II should climb above all enemies by side-climbing to Boom & Zoom. Boom & Run is used if you and another enemy are at the same altitude, level the plane out and keep flying straight until the enemy turns away. Stick to your teammates in case you need help.\n\nSpitfires are your worse enemy. They climb and turn better. P-47s can be problematic, but the Ki-94-II can out-turn them with proper use of flaps, elevator keys and throttle control. P-51Ds can also be an issue of the pilots behind them know what they're doing. Bombers such as the B-17, the B-24 and the B-29 are not much of a threat as the Ki-94-II's main role is to intercept them, however look out for their gunners as they can be deadly.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nThe Ki-94-II was Tachikawa Aircraft Company's response to the Japanese Imperial Army Air Force demands for a fast, high altitude interceptor featuring heavy armament as soon as Japanese intelligence learned about the B-29 to counter the B-29 raids as the aircraft available at that time for the IJAAF were inadequate to combat B-29s. The Ki-94-II was developed from the original Ki-94; the Ki-94-I which was an experimental high altitude interceptor with 2 propellers and a twin-tailed boom configuration (such as the tail of the Venom and the Vampire), one was a normal propeller on the front and the other was a pusher prop on the back. The Ki-94-II was created by Tatsuo Hasegawa. There were 2 prototypes of the Ki-94-II, one was fitted with a 4-blade propeller and the other one was to be fitted with a 6-blade propeller however the war ended before any of the prototypes made their maiden flight so the project was cancelled. The aircraft had 2 x 20 mm Ho-5 cannons and 2 x 30 mm Ho-155-I cannons, 150 rpg per 20 mm and 30 mm, 600 rounds in total.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Images\n[[File:Ki-94-II Alt camo.png|none|thumb|''\"Spotted Camouflage\"'', given to owners when total tasks completed by community reaches 3,500,000 during the event.]]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|fphmndESyNU|'''The Shooting Range #60''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:31 discusses the Ki-94-II.|amZQtFjHAn4|'''The Shooting Range #82''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:02 discusses the Ki-94-II.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4870-marathon-ki-94-ii-en|[Marathon] Ki-94-II]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/376496-tachikawa-ki-94-ii/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Tachikawa}}\n{{Japan fighters}}"}}
