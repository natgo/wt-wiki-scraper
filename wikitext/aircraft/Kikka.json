Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].\n\nThe Kikka, is a fast and versatile fighter-bomber. It starts out with a single 30 mm and you will have to research the 'otsu' mod before you can obtain the second 30 mm. It is important you utilize your speed to your advantage, as that is its biggest advantage against most aircraft it encounters. A good turner at high speed, but at low speed you may find it difficult to turn, as well as to regain your speed. Always maintain an energy advantage over your enemies, so you can quickly engage and disengage your targets. Never try to keep on them unless you know you have the advantage. The Kikka is a small aircraft which has great acceleration and climb, so it shines in vertical energy retention. It is recommended you do not 'head-on' other targets until you have acquired the ''Otsu'' mod. The Kikka is a very durable and well armoured aircraft, so it can take a multiple hits in a head-on.\n\nRegarding its bombing capabilities, equipping a bomb (either 500kg or 800kg, both of which are heavy) makes the Kikka significantly slower and more difficult to control. Speed is a must with the Kikka, and it is recommended you perform high-speed dive bombing to ensure both the destruction of your target and escaping slower pursuers. The speed previously gained in a dive can now be maintained by your unburdened plane. Make sure to use the rocket boosters to take off, or else the aircraft will have significant difficulty taking off with bombs equipped, and you will be unable to retract its landing gear.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Kikka has a good acceleration rate for its BR, as well as climb rate, and low top speed compared to later jets. The pilot is quite heavily protected from the front and rear by both armor, and the fuel tanks are self sealing. The (wing mounted) engines, on the other hand, take damage easily, and minor damage to them will further slow the plane to speeds that some props can match.\n\nIts 30 mm guns have a low rate of fire and low ammo count, but are very powerful and can down fighters with a few solid shots. The stock belt is lacking and it is recommended to research and use the tracer belt (HEF-T). There are no AP rounds, the closest thing being the \"practice\" shell, merely an unfilled HE shell. Strafing is discouraged as the guns simply arent a threat to anything but open-topped vehicles.\n[[File:CockpitImage_Kikka.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inside the cockpit of the Kikka]]\n\nThe Kikka should be played as a Boom & Zoomer. It has a great roll rate so it can still catch enemies that attempt to dodge it. Many pursuers can be outrun by going into a slight dive, and rolling to avoid enemy fire. Super props like the P-51H-5NA can catch the Kikka in certain situations, though the Kikka's top maintainable speed is much higher than theirs.\n\nTo attempt to gain the upper hand on a Kikka, propeller planes should dive from at least 2,000 m above the Kikka to be able to catch it. If the Kikka goes into a tight turn fight, it will generally bleed its energy, making it an easy target to be defeated by prop planes, which is usually the case when a jet attempt to engage a prop in a turnfight.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Whilst the clear resemblance can be seen, the Japanese were not able to receive all of the information that was provided through a negotiation on 1944 with the German high command over the licencing for plans on both the Me 262, BMW 003 and Junkers Jumo 004 Turbojet engines. Examples and plans were lost with the sinking on a I-29 Submarine that carried the important cargo, however all was not completely lost. Parts of the designs were saved as they were flown in to Japan separate from the Submarine. Upon further inspection of the BMW 003A plans, the Japanese designers found it somewhat similar to their own Ne 12, with the major differences being the German engine used a axial-flow compressor rather than a centrifugal compressor.\n\nThe plane is sometimes incorrectly identified in IJN designation as J9N1 or J9Y, but, like all other japanese \"special attack\" (suicide) planes, it was only given the name of Kitsuka (Kikka is the kanji pronounciation of \"中島 橘花\"). It was also called  \"Kōkoku Nigō Heiki\" (皇国二号兵器, \"Imperial Weapon No. 2\")\n\n[[File:FighterImage_Naval Technical Arsenal Ne-20, 1945.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Ne 20 engine that powered the Kikka]]\n\nWork began on newer engine designs. but ultimately the Ishikawajima Ne 20 engine was the one selected which was an indigenous Japanese design based on the knowledge of the German engines. The Kikka would be noticeably smaller than the German design, with more straight wings as opposed to the swept back leading edge of the [[Me_262_A-1a|Schwalble]]. Rather than the 4 x 30 mms cannons on the [[Me_262_A-1a|262]], the Kikka would use just one or two Type 5 30 mm cannons. The ever increasing pressure from the B-29 raids ensured that aircraft such as the Kikka were a high priority for the Japanese as interceptor aircraft. However the aircraft would not fly until August 7th 1945, by which time, the Japanese were rapidly running out of time. It would fly again on the 11th August 1945, suffering a crash landing which damaged the aircraft and its engines severely. That would be the last time the aircraft would fly again as just days later, the surrender of Japan was broadcast over the radio, signaling the end of the Kikka development.\n\n{{Clear}}\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=kitsuka Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|rN1o7IIsrM8|'''Realistic: Kikka [Valuable Lessons]''' - ''Jengar''|hgi1k_ljFYw|'''The Shooting Range #14''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 06:16 discusses the Me 262 and the Kikka.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Me 262 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/414733-nakajima-kikka/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [https://airpages.ru/eng/jp/j8n.shtml <nowiki>[Aviation of Word War II]</nowiki> J8N Kitsuka]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Nakajima}}\n{{Japan jet aircraft}}"}}
