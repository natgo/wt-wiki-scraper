It was introduced in [[Update 1.39]].\n\nThe La-15 is a special jet, it lies somewhere in the middle of the 8.0 jets due to its wings being incredibly weak for the engine it possesses and is one of the few planes that can break its wings clean off in level flight. However, due to the battle rating and the speeds that jet combat is usually fought at, you shouldn't need to rely on your top speed: The La-15 can be classed as an underestimated jet, relying on its performance at slow speeds (300 km/h - 700 km/h) to win battles of manoeuvrability.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe La-15 should be used in as an American Fighter when not in engagements (straight lines, absolute minimal turning to retain speed) and as a \"jet-turn-fighter\" when in engaged with enemy aircraft.\n\nHere are the DON'Ts of the La-15...\n\n# '''DON'T''' climb at the beginning of the match, use the beginning of the match to fly straight forward to the enemy, as low to the ground you can get.\n# '''DON'T''' keep yourself on 100% throttle. Use the special 112% power that the La-15's engine gives you. The WEP, as one could call it, lasts for a long time, and when overheating, just simply turn it off for about 15 - 60 seconds, after which it can be turned on again\n# '''DON'T''' commit to a head-on attack or turn hard after one. Your guns are hard to aim in the heat of head-on and it would be advised to break when closing in on a head-on, or preemptively turn to get on their 6 immediately.\n# '''DON'T''' get into a situation where you must fly at high speeds defensively. When an enemy shows up on your tail, if you have superior speed, outrun him, however, if he has superior speed, slow down to a point in which higher G turns don't G-lock you and where you can take full advantage of an enemy fighter's higher speed to get behind them. Make them bleed their energy turning to get you while avoiding their attacks and engage your flaps when you're slow enough to deploy without ripping.\n\nHowever, DO the following:\n\n# '''DO''' go straight at the beginning of the match, the La-15 still can reach a high enough speed where it can outrun planes that turn to get behind you.\n# '''DO''' bring 11 - 20 minutes of fuel at maximum. You'll have enough fuel to last you a usual jet battle's time with WEP on when you need it, and you won't catch on fire. The La-15 has a lot more manoeuvrability when only 11 minutes of fuel are taken. '''Do keep in mind that only taking 11 minutes of fuel will result in a lower wing rip speed of around 920 - 910 kph!'''\n# '''DO''' keep going straight after you break from a head-on attack or overshoot, you can win the acceleration battle with almost any American jet you face. '''You are ''light'', as with almost all Russian jets you are much lighter than your American counterparts and will always win a battle of low speed acceleration, but lose a battle of diving acceleration.'''\n# '''DO''' slow down when an enemy plane that's faster than you are behind you. Most enemy planes will try to keep their speed, which puts you in a situation to pull hard turns without G-locking. If you're fast, do some light horizontal turns, but don't turn into the vertical, most American fighters will beat you at energy retention at higher speeds then have no acceleration when they stall which leads you to always be in front of their guns. If possible, keep rolling and spiraling, using your 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' keys to dodge attacks and then come out as the slower but still manoeuvrable plane when they try to dogfight you.\n\n====Specific enemies worth noting====\n<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->\n'''F-86 Sabre/CL-13A Sabre:'''\n\nThe F-86 Sabre is one of the main rivals of the La-15 if up-tiered and facing allied teams. The Sabre can easily outmanoeuvre, outrun, and out climb the La-15. The best way to counter the Sabre is to attack it when it is at its most vulnerable position (low on energy, or damaged) or force it into a low-speed manoeuvring fight. Do not try to engage an F-86/CL-13A Sabre in any high-speed manoeuvres or any high-speed dogfighting in general as the Sabre will come out on top. In any low-speed manoeuvres, the Sabre will lose to the La-15 in any manoeuvring engagements.\n\n'''Meteor:'''\n\nThe Meteor is another main rival of the La-15 as the La-15 can meet the Meteor at any time from being down-tiered to up-tiered. While the La-15 can outrun and out climb early variants of the Meteors, the later variants are far harder to outrun and outclimb as they can easily catch the La-15. The best way to deal with Meteors is to apply boom and zoom tactics, but do remember a skilled Meteor pilot will have no issue avoiding a La-15 that is attacking with boom and zoom tactics. Avoid any manoeuvring fights with any variant of the Meteor as they will outmanoeuvre you with no issues at all.\n\n====Counter-tactics====\n<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->\nThe La-15 has, at best, a speed limit of 1000 km/h. Be aware of this and, if possible, try to out dive or outrun the La-15, as it can break its wings easily in a dive and in level flight. Its airbrake is ineffective in a hard dive unless the engine is turned off, so turn on an afterburner and keep it on until you have gotten into level flight.\nIf you are slower than the La-15, '''Do not try to climb, break, or use an airbrake''', the La-15 has very good energy retention in a climb and it's airbrake very effective at level flight, so refrain from these types of defensive flying.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Cannons have a decent rate of fire and punch.\n* Good energy retention.\n* Decent acceleration.\n* Cockpit visibility is above average.\n* Decent manoeuvrability around 500-700 km/h (310-435 mph).\n* Good roll rate.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Low top speed.\n* Can rip its wings off in level flight (speed warning at approximately 945 kph/587 mph, wings rip at 955 kph/593 mph).\n* Ineffective airbrake.\n* Guns have poor accuracy and very low muzzle velocity. Hitting a target can be difficult.\n* Ammunition is limited, restricted to firing short accurate bursts from close range.\n* Doesn't take battle damage very well especially to the wings of the aircraft.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

The NATO name for it was \"Fantail.\"\n\nDesigner S.A. Lavochkin followed on his successful line of World War II piston-engine fighters with a series of jet prototypes in 1947. One of these, the La-174, became the basis for the production La-15. The fighter used a licence-built Rolls-Royce Derwent engine. A larger and more capable prototype, the La-176D, would be the first Soviet aircraft to break Mach (first in a dive in 1948 and then in level flight the next year) but never entered production.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=jet_fighter&vehicle=la-15 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|vGVV_IRRVVI|'''Permanent Disadvantages - La-174 / La-15''' - ''DEFYN''|AbjFlWS9EzI|'''La-15 and La-174 - First Impressions''' - ''MagzTV''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[La-174]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[Yak-30]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Lavochkin_La-15|[Wikipedia] Lavochkin La-15]]\n* [http://www.airvectors.net/avlajet.html#m3 <nowiki>[Air Vectors]</nowiki> Lavochkin Jet Fighters - La-15]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lavochkin}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
