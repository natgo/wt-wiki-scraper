If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nSpeed is your greatest advantage. The La-200 can outrun every jet at its BR and even some 9.0 jets. At the beginning of a match try to gather speed as soon as possible. In an 8.0 game, if you accelerate up to about 1000km/h no one will catch you even if they dive on you. You can use your speed to zoom climb and surprise any climbing (or AFK-ing) players. Remember that other fighters will be more maneuverable and that you can't afford taking any hits (top speed drops horribly if you get hit). Always make sure that you have enough energy to run away from the enemy if you miss. And you will miss a lot, the 37mm cannons are hard to lead and quite inaccurate, so I wouldn't recommend using them on long distances. They are, however, extremely effective when they hit (one shot is almost always enough) so it's possible to get many kills without landing.\n\n===Radars===\n{{main|Toriy}}\nThe La-200 is equipped with a [[Toriy]] search radar, located in the radome in the centre of the air intake.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Toriy]] - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Guaranteed<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, detection of a target is practically guaranteed}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n|-\n| 15,000 m || 12,000 m || ±30° || ±32°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

All three Soviet design bureaus (Lavochkin, MiG, and Sukhoi) developed a prototype for testing.\n\nLavochkin's design, the La-200, had a long fuselage to accommodate its two turbojet engines, swept wings, and a large cockpit for two men. The La-200 took its maiden flight on September 9th, 1949. It was the only aircraft of the three designs to pass initial trials.\n\nBy the early 1950s, the La-200 was ready to enter production under the official designation La-17. However, due to the appearance of the Yak-120 (later known as Yak-25), which surpassed the La-200's performance in testing, the La-200 order was cancelled in favor of the Yakovlev design.\n\nOnly a single prototype of the La-200 was ever built, and it was modified several times during development to improve performance, correct flaws, and test other radar systems.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5319-development-la-200-the-high-speed-kite-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|bZvHRgBda9s|'''La-200 vs M.D.452 IIA''' - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|9VBAWLdfLcw|'''The Shooting Range #90''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:03 discusses the La-200.|t3xD7JpnHeI|'''Best aircraft for Boom & Zoom''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 5:21 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5319-development-la-200-the-high-speed-kite-en|[Devblog] La-200: The High-Speed Kite]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/402782-la-200-toriy/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lavochkin}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
