In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.35]].\n\nThe La-5 is an energy fighter. While having decent manoeuvrability, it is sluggish when flown at low speeds and suffers from the control surfaces locking up at higher velocities. It is best to gain altitude, stay around 2-3,000 meters and make short dives on distracted or weaker enemy planes.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Once the other planes are engaged, dive on one, fire a good burst, and pull away back to around 3,000 m, and do it again. Shallow dives like this typically best take place at a lower altitude than other boom and zoom aircraft, but here is where the plane's speed will be optimal for manoeuvrability. If you pick up a tail, speeds of around 300 kph/186.4 mph are the best for manoeuvring. This plane is one of the first Soviet fighters in the game to have a powerful engine, WEP, and effective cooling.\n\nThe 20 mm cannons are mighty, but low on total ammunition count. Only fly this plane after getting used to the trajectories of the other more forgiving Soviet planes, such as the Yak line, since they use the same cannons. It is typically best to use Ground Target ammo for its high explosive properties.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Adapted from the LaGG-3 fighter's airframe for the air-cooled M-82 engine.\n\nThe aircraft was powered by the 14-cylinder twin-row air-cooled Shvetsov M-82A radial engine with a maximum output of 1,700 hp.\n\nThe La-5 Type 37's armament consisted of two 20 mm synchronized ShVAK cannons with 170 shells each. They were installed in the nose of the fuselage above the engine.\n\nThe La-5 Type 37 differed from the prototype LaGG-3M-82 design in its front fuselage, which was given a more circular profile to provide a smooth transition between the engine and the sides without additional splice plates.\n\nThe La-5 had roughly equal flight characteristics to those of the Bf.109F, but was weaker than the newer Bf.109G, which appeared on the Soviet-German front at the same as the La-5, in the autumn of 1942.\n\nApart from that, as with many machines created in a hurry, the La-5 initially had many drawbacks.\n\nThe most serious of them were the stifling heat and gas contamination in the cockpit, caused by bad sealing in the engine compartment and a lack of ventilation. Another serious issue was the low-quality plexiglass in the cockpit windows, which quickly discolored in the sunlight and lost its transparency. In addition, high speeds and g-forces often caused the cockpit canopy to seize up.\n\nTo provide fresh air, increase visibility and allow for an emergency escape, the pilot had to keep the cockpit canopy open at all times, though regulations forbade this, as it significantly decreased the plane's maximum speed.\n\nThe first La-5 Type 37 Series 1-8 planes were produced in July 1942 at the No. 21 aviation plant in Gorky and went into service in August–September. Production continued until the end of 1942. In total, 1,021 La-5 Type 37s of all production series were produced.\n\nThroughout its series production, the aircraft's flaws were slowly corrected, but for it to go toe to toe with the Bf.109G and the other new German fighter, the FW.190, its flight characteristics needed to be increased.\n\n=== Notable pilots ===\n[[File:Ivan_Kozhedub_2.jpg|thumb|none|200px|link=User:U64962917#Kozhedub,_Ivan_N.|Soviet ace pilot [[User:U64962917#Kozhedub,_Ivan_N.|Ivan Kozhedub]], highest scoring Allied ace of WWII.]]\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Wallpaper La-5 Airfield.jpg|La-5 at an airfield\nFile:FAB-50 La-5drop.jpg|La-5 dropping a bomb\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/87239-lavochkin-la-5/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lavochkin}}\n{{USSR fighters}}"}}
