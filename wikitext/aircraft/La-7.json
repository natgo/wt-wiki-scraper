Start by flying at around 4.5 km altitude as you present yourself as an easy target for Boom & Zoom aircraft that are flying at higher altitudes. Maintain a high energy level/speed (conserve your energy as well). When you spot someone diving at you, break off and evade his burst, and then chase him and return your own bursts, or, if he turns, engage in turning combat. Watch your opponent, however. [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfire (Griffons)]] can, for the most part, out-turn a La-7 while other planes such as the [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190 D]] are far inferior at turning. It is possible to force overshoots on Spitfires by going into scissors. Acceleration on this plane is excellent at low-medium altitude (below 3 km where WEP still works). Additionally, the La-7 can be an effective mid-alt Boom and Zoom / energy fighter - when most opponents have been destroyed and the rest are engaging below you, the La-7, with its effective climb rate as well as acceleration/energy retention, can be unstoppable.\n\nOne habit you have to take to heart is aiming strategies/skill. The 2 cowling-mounted ShVAKs are quite ineffective in side-on approaches as well as longer range fire due to the fact that there is little spread to the cannons and low damage and hit detection compared to comparable 20 mm cannons such as the Hispano and MG-151. The low spread allows for greater damage upon hitting your opponent - if used correctly, the cannons can be extremely lethal. \n\nAnother habit worth developing in the La-7 is ammo conservation, it is crucial to only take shots that you know will hit and aiming them carefully. This way you stand a bigger chance of critically damaging the enemy aeroplane. By following those rules you will soon find yourself researching the final Lavochkin piston fighter - the [[La-9]].\n\nThe aircraft is placed quite low in the [[BR|Battle Rating]] spread, which means that you will still engage [[:Category:Third_rank_aircraft|rank III aircraft]]. Do not underestimate them. If flown up to their respective strengths, planes such as the [[Bf 109 G-2]] and [[Spitfire Mk Vc]] are superior to the La-7. The strengths of both La-7 variants lie in very good low altitude performance - ideally, you want to engage your enemies at altitudes lower than 4 km - higher up, the power output of the engine reduces drastically, making you an easy target. Aside from the speed, the La-7 possesses very good turning capabilities - while it is not as good a turner as some British and Japanese designs, it can give many German and US aircraft a run for their money.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

As the Soviet Unions highest ace, Ivan is three times recipient of the ''Hero of the Soviet Union'' award for shooting down 64 aircraft during the Great Patriotic War.]]\nThe concept of a new fighter for the Soviet Air Force was pitched in 1943. While the earlier Lavochkin La-5 proved to be one of the best Soviet fighters produced up to that point, the main designer of the [[La-5FN|La-5]], Semyon Lavochkin, felt that it could be improved even further. Work on a completely new fighter began in the early months of 1944. The new fighter was supposed to be an improved version of the La-5 design. The changes included the incorporation of a lighter and more durable metal airframe in place of the earlier wooden one. Other changes included the mounting of a new gun sight and propeller, as well as the strengthening of the landing gear struts and streamlining of the wings. It was to be armed with three Berezin B-20 20 mm cannons, however, the delay in production meant that most new La-7s were armed with 2 x 20 mm ShVAK cannons, like its predecessor. After more tests, the new fighter was accepted into serial production in late 1944.\n\nIn September 1944, the first La-7s found their way onto the front lines with the 63rd Guard Fighter Aviation Corps. The reception of the new fighter was warm - it was faster and more manoeuvrable than the La-5, which meant it could more efficiently tackle the most common German fighter the Soviets faced: the Messerschmitt [[Bf 109 G-6|Bf 109 G]]. In certain circumstances, the speed allowed the Soviet pilots to intercept [[Fw 190 F-8|Fw 190 fighter-bombers]] - a feat impossible to achieve for other Soviet fighters like the [[Yak-3]]. The main critiques of the design were considered to be the engine reliability and armament - the twin 20 mm ShVAK cannons were judged as inadequate in fights against better armoured Fw 190s. Still, the La-7 became one of the most successful Soviet piston fighters of World War II. Soviet ace Ivan Kozhedub scored 17 kills while flying the La-7 - his last one being an [[Me 262 A-1a|Me 262]] jet. After the war, the La-7 was replaced by the La-9 prop fighter, although many were still used by other communist states as both fighters and trainer aircraft.\n\n===In-game description===\nThe Lavochkin La-7 was a Soviet single-seat single-engine monoplane fighter. It was a further development of the La-5FN. The first prototype was built in January 1944, making its first flight on 2nd February and entering state trials on 16th February. The aircraft entered serial production in May 1944, designated La-7, and fully replaced the La-5FN on production lines by November 1944.\n\nThe La-7 was one of the best serial fighters of WWII, highly manoeuvrable with advanced performance characteristics and powerful armament. One on one, it was greatly superior to contemporary Axis, British and US fighters at low and medium altitudes. Other features included improved survivability and ease of control. A total of 5,735 La-7s were built before the end of WWII.\n\n=== Notable pilots ===\n\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-block;\"> [[File:Ivan_Kozhedub_2.jpg|thumb|none|200px|link=User:U64962917#Kozhedub,_Ivan_N.|Soviet ace pilot [[User:U64962917#Kozhedub,_Ivan_N.|Ivan Kozhedub]], highest scoring Allied ace of WW II.]] </li><!--\n<li style=\"display: inline-block;\"> [[File:X.jpg|thumb|none|250px|\"Image Description\"]] </li>\n<li style=\"display: inline-block;\"> [[File:X.jpg|thumb|none|250px|\"Image Description\"]] </li>\n<li style=\"display: inline-block;\"> [[File:X.jpg|thumb|none|250px|\"Image Description\"]] </li>-->\n</ul></div>\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=la-7 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|ScGocqGDQMo|'''Realistic: La-7 [Energy Monster]''' - ''Jengar''|RahK6Ig7xdg|'''La-7 & La-7 B-20S Gameplay & Review''' - ''DigitalDigging''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n* [[Dolgushin's La-7]] - A premium variant of the vehicle named after Soviet pilot Sergei Dolgushin.\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/3284/current|[Vehicle Profile] Lavochkin La-7]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/109515-lavochkin-la-7/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lavochkin}}\n{{USSR fighters}}"}}
