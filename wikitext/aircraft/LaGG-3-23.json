This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nAs a result of further work on transforming the LaGG from a \"pure\" fighter into a light attack aircraft, the LaGG 3 Series 11 appeared at the turn of 1941–1942. It had missile equipment and DZ-40 bomb racks for two bombs weighing up to 100 kg.\n\nTo reduce the plane's weight and finally increase its flight characteristics to acceptable levels, the series 11 completely lacked outboard fuel tanks, sacrificing flight range for speed. Suspended fuel tanks were intended for use when necessary, but in practice, they were only installed on a small batch of fighters made for the navy.\n\nThe following bombs could be suspended on the DZ-40 bomb racks underneath the wing: FAB-50 and FAB-100 general-purpose bombs, AO-25 fragmenting bombs and VAP-6M aerial spray instruments. These bomb racks could also carry ZAP-6 incendiary aerial instruments containing 38 litres of incendiary fuel each, or PSB-100 suspended fuel tanks containing up to 100 litres of gasoline.\n\nRO-82 launchers for RS-82 rockets were also installed under the wing. The standard design allowed for the installation of six RO-82 launchers. Combat units armed the LaGG-3 with rockets themselves, so the number of rockets varied between four to eight RS-82 rockets.\n\nSeveral planes were equipped with RO-132 rocket launchers instead of the RO-82, in order to launch the more powerful RS-132 rockets.\n\nThe LaGG-3 Series 11 went into production at the end of 1941. The first LaGG-3 Series 11 fighter-bombers took part in combat in the final stage of the Battle of Moscow, on the Kalinin front. Use of the LaGG-3 as a fighter-bomber and attack aircraft was relatively successful, as the LaGG-3 planes demonstrated higher combat survivability than other types of fighters.\n\nLater on, the LaGG-3 Series 11 was replaced by the Series 23 in manufacturing facilities. The Series 23 was practically identical to the Series 11 and had the same combat characteristics. Their production continued from the end of the winter of 1942 to the summer of 1942 and was the peak period of LaGG-3 fighter manufacturing in terms of quantity.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=lagg-3-23 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/195725-lavochkin-gorbunov-gudkov-lagg-3-series-23/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lavochkin}}\n{{USSR fighters}}\n{{USSR premium aircraft}}"}}
