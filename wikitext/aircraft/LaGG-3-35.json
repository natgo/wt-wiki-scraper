In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe LaGG-3-35 is a jack of all trades type of fighter aircraft. It does not have many weaknesses but also does not have many advantages. When flying the LaGG-3-35, it can be used in a variety of roles depending on what you are engaging in combat. Always keep in mind certain planes you battle may be better than the LaGG-3-35 at something.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n''Bomber Hunter:'' The LaGG-3-35 is a capable bomber hunter especially when using the rockets. Bombers that you would meet will easily disintegrate from a single rocket hit most of the time or be crippled so badly that they will eventually crash. Also the cannon and machine gun on the plane can do damage to enemy bombers as well, it will take some time but eventually the enemy bomber will go down.\n\n''Air Superiority:'' The LaGG-3-35 is a capable air superiority fighter as it can fight as a energy or turn fighter depending on what you face.\n\nSome vehicles to worry about if flying this plane:\n\n* [[Spitfire (Family)|Supermarine Spitfires]]: The Supermarine Spitfire is a plane to be feared when flying the LaGG-3-35 as many of the key strengths the LaGG-3-35 has, the Spitfire also has (if not better). When fighting the Spitfire, always try to go for the initial hit as early Spitfires do not react well to damage. Always remember do not get into manoeuvring fights with Spitfires as they will easily out manoeuvre the LaGG-3-35 at any speeds.\n* [[Ki-43 (Family)|Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa]] and [[A6M (Family)|Mitsubishi A6M Reisen]]: When battling these planes, altitude is everything. These two Japanese planes will have no issue outperforming a LaGG-3-35 in manoeuvrability. Therefore when facing these two enemy planes, use Boom and Zoom tactics to defeat them.\n* [[F4U (Family)|Vought F4U Corsair]]: The Corsair is a plane to be feared as its firepower and superior speed will be a major factor to watch out for. Do not try to outrun or go for head-on attacks if possible when confronting the F4U Corsair. Turn fighting is your best chance of success as the LaGG-3-35 will have no issue out turning them.\n* [[Bf 109 (Family)|Messerschmitt Bf 109 F]]: This plane is the worst enemy to face in a LaGG-3-35. The Bf 109 F will easily out perform the LaGG-3-35 in everything (firepower, manoeuvrability, climb rate, speed, and engine/plane performance at any altitude). Dealing with the Bf 109 F is going to come down to who has the most energy at the start of the engagement and who can force the other to lose all their energy during the course of the engagement.\n\nTo counter, the LaGG-3-35 is going to become a case of what your plane's advantage would be. The LaGG-3-35 does not have many weaknesses nor does it have any advantages. Therefore to shoot down the LaGG-3-35 is going to come down to what your plane's advantage is over the LaGG-3-35.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Good armament\n* Good energy fighter\n* Rockets can be used for air-to-air combat\n* Decent cannon ammo count\n* Best performance at low altitudes (< 3,000 m)\n* Stable gun platform\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Poor turn-fighting ability when compared to Yakovlev fighters at the same BR\n* Can have problems pulling out of a steep dive\n* Poor performance at high altitude\n* Doesn't react well to damage\n* No bulletproof glass or armour to protect the pilot in head-on attacks\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nThe LaGG-3 was designed in 1938 by Semyon Lavochkin, Vladimir Gorbunov and Mikhail Gudkov as an air superiority fighter. The LaGG-3 is upgraded version of the LaGG-1 which suffered from poor performance. The LaGG-3 would become a important plane for the Soviet Air Force during the early days of World War 2 on the Eastern Front. A total of 6,528 LaGG-3 would produced during its lifespan. It would be replaced by more capable planes later on in World War 2 such as the [[La-5]] which is a LaGG-3 air frame with a improved radial engine.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nTogether with two other fighters, this Soviet single-engine fighter replaced the obsolete I-16 and I-153, which at that time were the core fighters of the Soviet Air Force's RKKA. The LaGG-3 began appearing on the aviation scene in early 1941, several months prior to the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, and was manufactured at Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov until 1944.\n\nIn terms of armaments, the LaGG-3 carried two 12.7 mm Berezin BS machine guns, one 20 mm SHVAK cannon and six RS-82 or RS-132 rockets. In addition, bombs aboard the LaGG-3 could be suspended. Throughout its production, Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov manufactured dozens of variants of the more than 6,200 LaGG-3s it built.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=lagg-3-35 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[La-5 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/292298-lavochkin-gorbunov-gudkov-lagg-3-series-35/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lavochkin}}\n{{USSR fighters}}"}}
