It was introduced in [[Update 1.31]].\n\nThe LaGG-3-66 is a jack-of-all-trades type of fighter aircraft. It does not have many weaknesses but does not have many advantages. When flying the LaGG-3-66, it can be used in a variety of roles depending on what you are engaging in combat. Always keep in mind certain planes you battle may be better than the LaGG-3-66 at something.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

This plane is a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" type of aircraft. When the LaGG-3-66 gets up-tiered, it will face opponents in far superior planes that will outperform the LaGG-3-66 with no issues. Therefore, when flying the LaGG-3-66 in up-tiered matches, keep your energy high and always force the enemy to fight on your terms.\n\nWhen using this plane, it can be used in a variety of roles depending on what ordnance (secondary weapons), you may carry:\n\n* Bomber Hunter: the LaGG-3-66 is a capable bomber hunter, especially when using the rockets. Bombers that you would meet will easily disintegrate from a single rocket hit the majority of the time or be crippled so badly that they will eventually crash. Also, the cannon and machine gun on the plane can do damage to enemy bombers as well, it will take some time but eventually the enemy bomber will go down.\n\n* Air Superiority: the LaGG-3-66 is a capable air superiority fighter as it can fight as an energy or turn fighter depending on what you face. But no matter what happens, you must always keep your energy up. There is a high chance in the LaGG-3-66 to face planes that can outperform this plane with no issues except in low-speed manoeuvres.\n\n====Specific enemies worth noting====\n<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this plane. (i.e. Japanese fighters will out turn you)-->\n* [[Spitfire (Family)|Supermarine Spitfires]] - The Spitfire is a plane to be feared when flying the LaGG-3-66 as many of the key strengths the LaGG-3-66 has, the Spitfire has (if not better). When battling the Spitfire, always try to go for the initial hit as early Spitfires (Spitfire Mk I/IIa) do not react well to damage. If you are battling cannon armed Spitfires, always go for the initial hit but remember the cannon armed Spitfire has far superior firepower compared to the LaGG-3-66 and will have no issues destroying the LaGG-3-66. Always remember not to get into manoeuvring fights with Spitfires as they will easily outmanoeuvre the LaGG-3-66 at any speeds.\n\n* [[Ki-43 (Family)|Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa]] and [[A6M (Family)|Mitsubishi A6M Reisen]] - When battling these planes, altitude is everything. These two Japanese planes will have no issue outperforming a LaGG-3-66 in manoeuvrability. Therefore when facing these two enemy planes, use Boom and Zoom tactics to defeat them. The Ki-43 and the A6M are some of the few planes that the LaGG-3-66 will face that can easily defeat the LaGG-3-66 at low-speed manoeuvring air to air combat.\n\n* [[F4U (Family)|Vought F4U Corsair]] and [[F6F (Family)|Grumman F6F Hellcat]] - The Corsair and the Hellcat should be feared as their firepower (compared to the LaGG-3-66's firepower) and superior speed are major factors to watch out for. Do not try to outrun or go for head-on attacks if possible when confronting the F4U Corsair or the F6F Hellcat. Turn fighting is your best chance of success as the LaGG-3-66 will have no issue out turning them.\n\n* [[C.205 serie 1|Macchi C.205]] - This plane is another key enemy of the LaGG-3-66. The Macchi C.205 is a capable enemy that can outperform the LaGG-3-66 in every category except at low speeds. When facing the Macchi C.205 try to force low-speed turn fighting, eventually, the advantage will fall to the LaGG-3-66.\n\n====Counter-tactics====\n<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. They will most likely BnZ, etc.)-->\nCountering the LaGG-3-66 is going to become a case of what your plane's advantage is. The LaGG-3-66 does not have many weaknesses nor does it have any major advantages. Therefore to shoot down the LaGG-3-66 is going to come down to what your plane's advantage is over the LaGG-3-66. If you are in a plane that has a higher BR than the LaGG-3-66, more than likely your plane's advantages will easily outweigh the LaGG-3-66's advantages except in low speed fights.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe series 66 planes were the last series model of the LaGG-3. Outwardly, fighters of this series could be differentiated by their new cockpit canopy (the same one used on the La-5), and its frontal bullet-proof glass. Additional changes included a lighter fuselage frame, altered airvent shape and the installation of bomb rack fairings.\n\nAs with the Series 35 fighters, the LaGG-3 Series 66 was equipped with an expanded water radiator, an altered airvent shape, automatic wing slats and a retractable tail wheel. The plane's aerodynamics were significantly refined. In particular due to altered water and oil radiator tubes and newly installed fairings on the exhaust pipes.\n\nThe VISh-61P propeller was replaced with the VISh-105SV, which had wider blades. The propeller spinner also became slightly wider and took on a flatter shape.\n\nLaGG-3 Series 66 fighters were practically never used as attack aircraft, so they did not receive missile equipment.\n\nFactory No. 31 in Tbilisi produced LaGG-3 Series 66 planes starting in the spring of 1943. In June 1944, production of the LaGG-3 ceased once and for all.\n\nThe LaGG-3 Series 66 was the lightest and most aerodynamic series of the LaGG-3s, but even they could not compare to the new Yak and La fighters. Nonetheless, planes of this model saw successful use in air combat above Kuban and in the storming of Novorossiysk. LaGG-3s were widely used in navy units in the Baltic and Black Sea fleets. In the final stage of the war, LaGG-3s were primarily used in economy-of-force operations due to their poor flight characteristics, and fought in the Baltics and the Karelian Isthmus. In August 1945, LaGG-3 planes took part in combat operations against Japan in the Far East. By the end of 1945, the air force had practically no LaGG-3s left in its combat units.\n\nIn total, 6,528 LaGG-3s were produced between the years of 1941 and 1944, with their production hitting its peak in 1942.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=lagg-3-66 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/179342-lavochkin-gorbunov-gudkov-lagg-3-series-66/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lavochkin}}\n{{USSR fighters}}"}}
