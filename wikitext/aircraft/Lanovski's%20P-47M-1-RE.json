It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 \"Masters of the Sea\"]] but has only been made available for purchase in-game with Golden Eagles {{GE}} for specific Polish mini-events like the [[wt:en/news/5872-special-a-centenary-of-poland-regaining-independence-en|2018 \"Centenary of Poland Regaining Independence\"]], the [[wt:en/news/6938-event-102-year-anniversary-of-poland-regaining-independence-en|2020 \"102 Year Anniversary of Poland Regaining Independence\"]], the [[wt:en/news/7419-special-103-year-anniversary-of-poland-regaining-independence-en|2021 \"103 Year Anniversary of Poland Regaining Independence\"]], and the [[wt:en/news/7667-special-polish-constitution-day-en|2022 \"Polish Constitution Day\"]] events.\n\nThe plane is painted in the camouflage scheme of the Polish US Army Air Force pilot, Witold Łanowski of the 61st Fighter Squadron.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe P-47M is a high-altitude interceptor that has impressive armament and ordnance that serves it well in both the fighter and Close Air Support role. In Air RB, it is currently unequalled in performance at a 5.7 battle rating, possessing ridiculous top speed, competitive climb rate, decent energy retention, great armament, and surprising manoeuvrability at speed.\n\nAs such, the P-47M is best played to its strengths as a Boom & Zoom and Boom & Run fighter in Air realistic battles. In the Ground realistic battles it is an excellent fighter bomber with a good rocket/bomb load-out and .50 cals which can deal with most turret roof armour.\n\nThe M variant was specifically set up to intercept Germany's buzz-bombs and the new [[Me 262 A-1a|jet]]/[[Me 163 B|rocket]] powered fighters. The primary advantage of this new variant came through speed. The aircraft was powered by either a Pratt & Whitney R-2800-14W or R-2800-5 engine while using the CH-5 turbo-supercharger. The aircraft was able to produce 2,800 hp, giving it a higher top speed.\n\nIn War Thunder Air realistic battles, the P-47M sits at a battle rating of {{specs|BR|RB}} while having the performance qualities of super-props. Top speeds above 5km exceed literally any opponent besides the [[Ta 152 H-1]] (which is only capable of competing at around 9-10 km). Climb rate is great, at around an average of 23 m/s from 0-6000 m. WEP is available for up to 12 minutes to maximize engine output.\n\nInterestingly (besides the better engine), the P-47M gets a unique airbrake which makes it very easy to stick behind the tails of opponents in a high-speed dive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 9,144 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nFirst of all, P-47 should '''always''' fly fast. No matter the altitude, it is recommended to fly at speeds higher than 520 km/h (~320 mph). One of the few things P-47 is terrible at doing is dogfighting. Imagine a truck loaded with cement with wings strapped to the side. Congratulations, you just pictured a P-47 flying at low speeds. Now, with this out of the way you must remember one thing and one thing only, when and where possible, fly high, the higher the better. The higher in altitude the P-47 goes the better the engine performs compared to its potential adversaries. The best altitude for P-47M is around 9,000 meters (~30,000 ft), but it still can perform very good at lower altitudes ranging from 6,000 meters (~20,000 ft) to 8,000 meters (~26,000 ft). One drawback of the P-47M's engine is that it can easily overheat when using WEP for extended periods of time, however, most of the time just disabling WEP for few seconds will be enough to cool down the powerful Pratt & Whitney powerplant hidden under the hood.\n\n====== Game modes ======\n'''Arcade:''' In AB much of what was mentioned above can be disregarded due to the adjusted flight model of arcade battles, instead just put your throttle to WEP, climb above your enemies and Boom & Zoom them. It is important to realize that while the P-47 can be the king of the hill, there are a few others which will buck for the spot too including Spitfires, Fw 190s and Bf 109s as they can climb as good as you and they often have cannons which in no time can dismantle a P-47 quickly in flight.\n\n'''Air Realistic:''' In RB P-47M's pilot should '''not''' take any additional armaments such as bombs and rockets, they will only slow down the plane and make it an easy prey for Bf 109 K-4s, Ta 152s and Fw 190s. As soon as you take off from the airfield divert 30 degrees to left or right (depends on where the middle of the map is, just don't climb towards the middle), engage WEP and climb at ~17-18 degrees. The best speed for climbing is around ~267 km/h (~165 mph). When you reach an altitude of about 5,500 meters (18,000 ft) start to gradually turn towards the middle of the map. Watch out for any enemy planes coming towards you, especially the Ta 152s and Bf 109 K-4s which are the biggest threats as they have similar performance output compared to the P-47M. At ~6,000 meters you will notice that climbing at 18 degrees makes your plane go slower and is necessary to adjust the angle of attack to 10-15 degrees. It is also a plausible option to stop climbing at this point since you will probably be above everyone. Next, it is recommended to fly level and gain some speed, but not more than 400 km/h (~250 mph). In this situation, the P-47 will reign supreme over the skies, look around you, see if there are any enemy planes spotted and pick off the easiest targets, preferably slow-flying fighters which are flying straight. If you cannot see such targets go for other fighters, 109s and G.55s are your priority targets, as they can easily kill you if you are not careful.\n\nAlways perform powered dive and if you feel you're going too fast just extend the airbrakes long enough to reign in the aircraft's speed which is one of the biggest advantages of P-47M over the D-series and other comparable non-allied prop fighters. When you are over with the ''Boom'' portion of the flying do not climb outright, instead, speed away from the enemies (preferably towards your teammates) increasing distance between you and anyone tailing. When you gain ~3 km (~2 miles) of separation from enemy planes you can do the ''Zoom'' part of the tactic or keep running if you're feeling that the enemy planes could catch up to you. Climb at 10 degrees and gain enough altitude to ensure that you have an energy advantage above enemy planes. In most dire situations you can try to go for head-on (only if you have at least 2.5 km separation from the enemy) attack, but it's not recommended to do that as you will most likely damage your engine in the process. In the worst-case scenario, the fighter will catch fire and burn up. If you see an enemy fighter which is attempting to dive at you, try to force them to overshoot, call for help and fly towards your closest teammate. You can shrug off few hits to the fuselage but anything that touches your wings and elevators will most likely disable or destroy the aircraft's ability to fly well or at all. Flying with your friends also helps as you can quickly call them to assist you. If you're the only one left on your team you should climb, look out for enemy fighters and Boom & Zoom them, just keep in mind that P-47 is not the best plane to do 1 vs 2 in. Try to separate enemies and pick them off one by one.\n\nThe last thing you should do in P-47 is ground-pound in realistic battles. Taking bombs and rockets will make your plane even more sluggish than it already is and because of that you will have to fly near the ground, and that typically makes the P-47 easy pickings for other enemy fighters. Bombers are typically a difficult target to go after as they usually soak up quite a bit of ammunition before taking critical damage and you risk being set afire or sniped by the defensive gunners.\n\nIt is important to mention the two schools of thought regarding the ammunition belts for .50 cals. The first one says that you should use ''Ground Targets'' belts because of the high amount of armour piercing rounds which do a lot of damage and can easily shred anything hit with them. However, the second school of thought states one should use ''Tracers'' belts because they have the highest chance of setting the enemy on fire which will typically leads to a fiery destruction of the enemy aircraft. But, there's one thing everyone agrees on: Don't use ''Default'' belts, upgrade away from them as soon as possible.\n\n'''Simulator'''\n\nIn Simulator / Enduring Confrontation, bulkier planes that suffer in AB & RB shine and that of course includes the P-47. In Sim, the P-47 has great control handling, , fast speed, and a wide range of additional armaments of bombs and rockets, plus the original 8 x .50 cal, meaning it is an excellent multi-role aircraft. However, the razorback P-47's have more canopy frames that can be obstructing in a dogfight, plus its iconic razorback completely blocking your rear vision, it means you have subpar visibility. It can perform base-bombing, ground pounding, bomber intercepting and traditional BnZ fighting.\n\nFor base bombing, choose the maximum setup of 1 x 500 lbs, 2 x 1,000 lbs and 10 x rockets to maximise the damage. The fastest way to get to a base is to remain at tree-top level upon taking off. This way there is no need to climb so the P-47 can pick up quite some speed like that, even with the full bombload. It is also harder to be seen, since the P-47's dark colour will blend in with the ground for some maps. When approaching the base, check its position with the minimap to ensure it's the right target. When the base fills up the gunsight, pull up to around 500 m and then dive at the base at a rather shallow angle. Now you can fire all the rockets as the distance is pretty close. When the gunsight slices past the furthest edge of the base, release all the bombs, bank to the direction of the nearest friendly airfield, descend back to tree-top level and fly back. If you are lucky, you might even catch some enemy bombers that just took-off from a nearby airfield. They will be some nice RP for you. Overall, base bombing is the safest way to get rewards.\n\nFor ground pounding, you can choose to take the full bombload if you want. Use the bombs and rockets to take out pillboxes and tanks. The aiming method for bombs is pretty similar to base bombing, but there are differences for the 500 lb and 1000 lb, as their drop are different and you want to adapt the aim to be more precise, because now the targets are much smaller. Dive at a shallow angle to approach the target, try to get as close as possible but avoid crashing into the ground. When the gunsight slices through and just above the target, drop the 1000 lbs. When the target is at the center of the gunsight and fills up around 1/3 of it, release the 500 lb. The 8 MGs are perfect for killing trucks, AA guns and artilleries as they have plenty of ammo. However, constantly watch your surrounding, especially your high 6 for any incoming enemies.\n\nYou want to be more careful when hunting bombers, since with the Sim control (whether it be mouse joystick or a real stick) the plane will manoeuvre much more gently, making itself a great target for the bomber's gunners. Do not follow behind a bomber's tail unless you are sure that its tail gunners are unconscious. Chasing behind a bomber makes yourself pretty much stationary for the tail gunners, and you will be showered with bullets. The big radial engine of the P-47 will usually get damaged. Instead, before launching an attack, get an altitude advantage over the bomber by flying around 2 km above it. The bomber should only fill up about 1/6 of your gunsight. The best position for an attack is at the bomber's high 6 so you can adjust the lead much easier. Dive at the bomber, but not directly at it, try to predict where you two will crash by imagining yourself as a missile, that's where you should aim at (deflection shooting). To maximise the damage it is better to aim for their wings and engines, as the fuselage usually soaks up quite some bullets. Only fire when the bomber passes in front of your guns. This short window might seems inadequate to do anything, but the 8 MG on the P-47 are actually quite destructive, as sometimes it only takes one bullet to set the target aflame.\n\nAs for dogfighting, because almost all aerial battles in Sim occurs at below 3,000 m, the P-47 can easily climb to this altitude and gather up lots of speed before engaging a battle. The tactic is similar to the RB one above. If, unfortunately, you find yourself being chased at your 6 and you don't know how to do any defensive manoeuvres, do a large, smooth turn towards the nearest friendly airfield to avoid bleeding too much speed. Then shallow-dive towards your airfield. The P-47 can quite easily outrun opponents like the A6M or Bf 109 E, but struggles to outrun Bf 109 F/G, FW-190 A or other P-47. Another way of disengaging is to do a sudden split-S to dodge under the chaser. Average Sim players will now try and see where you went, if not immediately losing track of you. You can then run for your airfield or shallow climb for another attack.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting (sim):'''\n\n* [[Me 264]]: This giant is one of the few bombers who get air spawns in Sim, so it usually flies higher than you think. On top of this, the Me 264 is armed with large calibre MG and cannons all over it, therefore tailing a 264 is basically suicide unless all of their gunners are knocked out. You can treat the 264 almost like a B-29 or B-17 as they are very similar in both design and defensive capabilities. It is best to head-on the 264 if you can as you can easily knock out the pilots due to its glazed nose while also taking minimal damage. However the bomber lacks a ventral turret on its belly, making it easy to deal damage from below, but be wary of the downwards facing rear 20 mm cannon near the tail. The safest way to attack is from a higher altitude, dive at an oblique angle and focus fire on the wings and nose. Never engage if you have no altitude advantage.\n* [[Bf 110 (Family)|Bf 110]], [[Ki-45 (Family)|Ki-45]], [[A-26 (Family)|A-26]]: As mentioned before, those twin engine aircraft are a big threat since their lack of manoeuvrability comparing to single engine fighters are minimised in Sim. They are usually armed with heavy guns & cannons in the nose, so an accurate burst will tear any plane apart, including the P-47. The P-47 manoeuvres rather sluggishly and you might get out-turned from even those heavy fighters, so engage them with either altitude or speed advantage to avoid being targeted. If they are not manoeuvring aggressively, aim for their wings or engines. If the fight is intense and you cannot smooth the aim, just burst anywhere as long as you hit them, the 12.7 mm bullets will damage their flight models quite a bit.\n* [[ZSD63]]: A dangerous SPAA to go up against in Tank Realistic Battles. Though it is hard to identify specific SPAA vehicles on the ground (especially when they are shooting tracers at the plane), if a ZSD63 is identified, avoid it at all costs and '''do not''' attempt head-ons with it, ever. It can easily snap a wing off by casually putting a short burst in the P-47D-25's flight path. Don't even get close to it unless it is busy shooting someone else or if the P-47D-25 has a bomb ready for use. Some identifying features of the ZSD63 is its rather boxy and tall hull with a geometric turret sitting at the back, slightly similar to a Wirbelwind's. The firing manner is also distinctive: the sound and green tracers are very rapid, much like a buzz saw, but then it will remain silent for half a minute reloading. Note that an experienced ZSD player will hold its fire or shoot in single salvos with long halts between, making it look like that it's reloading. Armour piercing belt is recommended since their high penetration can tear through the ZSD's armour with ease and knock out its crews.\n* [[Yak-2 KABB]]: Do not think that the P-47D-25 can confidently outmanoeuvre this plane just because it is twin-engined. The Yak-2 has an amazing turn rate for a heavy fighter, thus the P-47D-25 must avoid turning with it, if not dogfighting with it in general. It bears a pair of ShVAK cannons that can easily damage vital parts like engine or cooling systems. It has green camo, greatly resembling an Me 410 but with an H-tail like a Bf 110's.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

They were also equipped with a larger CH-5 turbo-supercharger allowing the aircraft to reach 2800hp at 32,000 feet. Air brakes were also added underneath the wings to aid in deceleration and recovery during dives. These four prototypes were re-designated YP-47M.\n\nThe engine installations were eventually added to the last 130 P-47D-30s from Farmingdale in Sept of 1944. They were all re-designated P-47M-1-RE. It is important to note that the under-wing racks were not fitted to this aircraft. It was intended to be strictly a fighter. They were delivered in Dec. of 1944. The dorsal fins were later added as a field modification.\n\nThe M-variant saw service with the 56th Fighter Group but problems with the new highly tuned R-2800 delayed their use until the last weeks of the war in Europe. At one point the aircraft was pulled from service and replaced with D variants until the aircraft performed reliably. The P-47M was never used against V-1 flying bombs, its original target.\n\n=== Witold Łanowski ===\nWitold Łanowski was born in Lwów, Poland (now Lviv in Ukraine) on June 8, 1915. His father got a job as a bank manager in Zakopane, and his family subsequently moved there. Łanowski graduated from elementary school, and then attended the 11th Mathematics and Natural Sciences Gymnasium in Lwów. At the 11th Mathematics and Natural Sciences Gymnasium, he began to learn to fly. In 1935, he moved to the Aviation Cadet School in Dęblin, which he graduated from in 1938 but stayed at as an instructor.\n\nDuring the invasion of Poland in September 1939, he flew combat missions in the defense of Dęblin - achieving two aerial victories against enemy aircraft - before the school retreated to southern Poland. The Soviet Red Army captured Łanowski's unit as they were trying to reach Romania on 17 September. After he and several others escaped, Łanowski managed to cross the Romanian border on 27 September. He remained in Romania for a month before moving to France, where he was jailed in May 1940 for criticizing the French command. Again, Łanowski escaped and this time made it to Britain in July 1940.\n\nHis Royal Air Force (RAF) flight training began in April 1941, and after graduation he was assigned to 308 \"Krakow\" Fighter Squadron. In November, he transferred to 317 \"Wileński\" FS and then to 308 \"Poznań\" Fighter Squadron in January 1942. He was transferred to Squadron 302 in December 1942, commanding Squadron A. He lost his command position after an argument with a British official, and was only reinstated in March 1944 - flying a P-51B Mustang in 335 Reconnaissance Squadron. It was during this time that he was given the nickname of \"Lanny\" by American aviators.\n\nHe was then transferred to the 56th Fighter Group, 61st Fighter Squadron, US Army Air Force (USAAF). The 61st FS flew Republic P-47M Thunderbolts, and Łanowski shot down four enemy planes while serving in the USAAF, bringing his total to six planes downed.\n\nAfter the war, Łanowski once again flew for the RAF, this time as a transport pilot. He had an accident at the German Fassburg Airport while flying the de Havilland Venom and subsequently spent eleven months undergoing medical treatment before he was finally released. After serving another two years with the RAF, Łanowski then flew as a mercenary in the Katanga Air Force in 1962. His unit flew there for two years before Katanga lost the war.\n\nWitold Łanowski passed away in London on 16 September, 1993.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/5872-special-a-centenary-of-poland-regaining-independence-en|Centenary of Poland Regaining Independence]] ===\nWitold Łanowski, nicknamed \"Lanny\" first enrolled in the military in memory of his colleagues as a self-confident and impartial individual and demonstrated himself as a great instructor and pilot. He was born on June 8th, 1915 in Lwów, and in 1935 he joined the Cadet School in Dęblin. After four years he became an instructor. During World War II, thanks to Gładych's support, he was transferred to the American 61st Fighter Squadron, where on May 15th, 1944, he finally took control of a Thunderbolt.
