In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Danger Zone\"]].\n\nThe Lightning F.53 is an export variant of the [[Lightning F.6]] which was used by the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) and the Kuwait Air Force (with the in-game vehicle representing a RSAF Lightning). The main difference between the Lightning F.53 and the standard F.6 version is that the F.53 can carry a selection of ground attack ordnance (bombs and rockets). The Lightning F.53 retains the stacked engines and side-mounted missiles, while adding to the list of unusual design choices with the unique ability to carry ordnance on top of the wings; something very few other aircraft were designed to do (the [[Jaguar GR.1A]] being a notable one).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 12,192 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThe Lightning F.53 has an identical internal layout to the [[Lightning F.6]] upon which it is based. This means that most of the area in the wings is full of fuel tanks; likewise the stacked and staggered engines are retained. While the top engine is exposed and vulnerable to enemy attacks it can often absorb bullets, protecting the lower engine from damage (assuming the enemy is attacking you from the rear and above).\n\nWhere the Lightning F.53 does differ from the Lightning F.6 is in the addition of a 64 mm bulletproof glass windscreen. This is the only armour found on either aircraft.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.
