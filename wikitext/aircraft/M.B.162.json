It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 \"Vive la France\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Bloch M.B.162 is the best indigenously-designed bomber France has at its disposal, behaving similarly to the American [[B-17 (Family)|B-17]]. It is deceptively quick for a strategic bomber, and has an excellent climb rate that allows it to get to its safe altitude quickly. However, its excellent performance does not mean that it is lacking in bomb load or defensive armaments as one might expect. Although having a lower total capacity than the earlier [[N.C.223.3]], it has a higher bomb load than any other indigenous French bomber and a defensive armament that matches the previously mentioned 223. All-in-all, the 162 can be seen as a sort of \"Best of Both Worlds\" of the French bomber tree, combining the excellent speed, climb rate and manoeuvrability of the lighter twin engined bombers with the bomb load and defensive armament of the heavy bombers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe M.B.162 is a heavy bomber, and therefore should be flown as such. When you start a match, you will want to climb to 6-7 km in altitude to protect yourself from German and Italian fighters that will climb to intercept you. With both of the payload options, all bombs are needed to destroy a bombing base. It is worthy to note that the M.B.162 can be significantly more aggressive in Arcade, where its already excellent performance is boosted to further levels.\n\nHowever, being a bomber, fighters will go out of their way to take you down (sometimes even at the expense of their own aircraft). Although the Hispanos are relatively inaccurate when fired in long bursts, they can be very devastating when fired in .5 second bursts at an aircraft's cockpit. But it is also to note that if you can hit an enemy with your turrets, they can hit you with their guns as well, which can be a large problem when fighting the multi-cannon armed Fw 190, Bf 109, C.202EC/C.205 and G.55 fighters that all mount the universally feared [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG 151]] that has access to the dreaded Minengeschoß round.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

'''Société des Avions Marcel Bloch''' was a French aircraft manufacturer of both military and civilian aircraft which changed its name to Dassault Aviation after the end of World War II. The company was originally founded by Marcel Bloch (hence \"MB\" in the aircraft designations) who, after the war changed his name to Marcel Dassault, the Bloch M.B. 162 shares very few common points with his civilian counterpart, especially concerning its wings<ref name=\"dassault01\" />\n\nThe aircraft in-game represents a heavy bomber created by Henri Déplante and Lucien Servanty in order to satisfy the A20 program concerning a category B5 bomber, which had a crew of 5 persons utilised for both day and night bombing. Three M.B.162s were ordered into production in 1937.\n\nUnfortunately, the first flight of the M.B.162 wasn't until the 1st of June 1940 <ref name=\"dassault01\" /> and it never saw combat during the Battle of France (10 May to 25 June 1940). With the fall of France, the prototype of the M.B.162 fell into the Luftwaffe's hands and was used as transport aircraft for the rest of the war. After the war, the aircraft was returned to the French who utilised it in the Armée de l'Air and became the origin of the SNCASE Languedoc (post-war airliner, used for hypersonic experimentations).\n\nTwo versions of this plane existed: the MB.162.01 (prototype, one built) and the MB.162 Bn.5 (Production model, never produced).\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=mb_162 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|G6enBS8bPrU|'''The Shooting Range #267''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:02 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/385698-bloch-mb-162-b5/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [https://www.dassault-aviation.com/fr/passion/avions/bloch-militaires/mb-162/ <nowiki>[Dassault Aviation]</nowiki> MB 162]\n* [[Wikipedia:Bloch_MB.162|[Wikipedia] Bloch MB.162]]\n\n=== References ===\n;Citations\n<references>\n<ref name=\"dassault01\">Dassault-aviation website (n.d.)</ref>\n</references>\n\n;Bibliography\n* Dassault-aviation website [https://www.dassault-aviation.com/fr/passion/avions/bloch-militaires/mb-162/ L'avion MB 161, de taille légèrement inférieure et de performances comparable au B-17, ne possède que très peu d'éléments en commun avec les MB 160 et MB 161, son aile, notamment, est très différente.], Dassault-aviation website, On-line.\n* Dassault-aviation website [https://www.dassault-aviation.com/fr/passion/avions/bloch-militaires/mb-162/ La construction du prototype à Courbevoie est retardée jusqu'à la fin de 1939.
