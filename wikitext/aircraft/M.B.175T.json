In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 \"Masters of the Sea\"]].\n\nAlthough called a \"bomber\", with its hard-hitting armament of two 20mm [[MG 151/20 (20 mm)|MG 151/20]] cannons, this plane should be used in a more aggressive role as an attacker, or even a bomber interceptor. The HVAR rockets and the MG 151/20s make it a perfect counter to the much-feared [[BV 238]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.
