It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 \"Vive la France\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is something of a jack of all trades, while less potent in nearly every aspect than the M.D.452 IIC. Its flight performances are balanced, if a bit slow in accelerations. The roll rate is excellent at medium to high speeds (550 - 900 km/h), giving the aircraft many options for evasive manoeuvres, and although energy-bleeding, the turn rate is good against most enemies. This version carries a cluster of four 20 mm M50 canons, which fare moderately at this battle rating.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use.

Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty.\n\nLike all French aircraft in all battle rating, the default ammunition belt is extremely underwhelming, with \"practice rounds\" representing 25% of the belt composition. As such, the research of the newer sets of ammo belts should be prioritized. Once upgraded, the {{PAGENAME}} will still struggle to destroy an enemy plane in a single pass, but each hitting burst is decisive as the rounds are potent enough to severely damage the adversaries' engine/controls/wing surface.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is generally more manoeuvrable than most other contemporary aircraft it faces, the only ones you would have a tough time turning with at this battle rating would be any of the Sabres. Since its roll rate is comparable to the Sabre's once the \"New Boosters\" modification is installed, the option of turnfighting becomes available, although speed will be bled at a relatively high rate. Still, like the predecessors of the Mystère II, boom & zooming should remain the first choice in engagements; but unlike the M.D.452 IIC, this aircraft's engine is slightly less powerful, and one or two minutes of sideclimb might be necessary to remain in control of the engagement situation. Commands stiffening doesn't appear under around 1,000-1,050 km/h, and subtle use of airbrakes will be necessary to ensure control during the whole descent.\n\nOverall, the {{PAGENAME}} should be considered as a second line fighter, and fares better when paired with support. Another secondary role can be as a harasser, BnZing many different enemies, to damage them, and go around later for another decisive pass, or even letting allies finish off the disabled foes.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

The aircraft combined the fuselage of the Ouragan with a new swept-wing, enabling it to reach much faster speeds than its predecessor. In 1951, the Mystere IIA became the first French-designed plane to break the sound barrier, in a controlled dive.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later on, the aircraft would enter service with the French Air force, and serve until 1957, when it was relegated to training duties.\n\n=== Design and Development ===\nThe M.D.452 Mystere was originally designed as an advanced variant of the preceding M.D. 450 Ouragan, with a new wing section and engine. In 1950, Marcel Dassault, the head of the Dassault aviation firm, signed a contract to produce an M.D.450 Ouragan with a new thinner wing section.<ref name=\":0\" /> The aircraft had a wing swept back at 30 degrees compared to the Ouragan's 14 degrees, and was powered by a license-built version of the Rolls-Royce Nene. During tests, the aircraft showed significantly better climb rate and top speed, being capable of reaching transonic speeds. After four prototypes, the M.D.452 IIA was developed, carrying four 20 mm Hispano cannons and the Rolls-Royce Tay engine. On October 28th 1951, a Mystere IIA became the first French aircraft to break the sound barrier, in a controlled dive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHowever, the M.D.452 IIA failed to enter service, as it was rapidly replaced by the M.D.452 IIB and IIC. The IIB and IIC retained the wing and fuselage of the IIA, while featuring a new intake design and a pair of 30 mm DEFA cannons in place of the IIA's four Hispanos. The new IIC was re-engined with a SNECMA Atar turbojet, capable of producing 25 kN of thrust.<ref name=\":1\" /> The M.D.452 IIC would later go on to enter service, serving between 1954 and 1963.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=md_452_mystere_2a Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|bZvHRgBda9s|'''La-200 vs M.D.452 IIA''' - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|fa1_8SqJcT0|'''The Shooting Range #97''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 06:04 discusses the Dassault Mystère II.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of a similar configuration, role or era\n* [[F-86F-25]]\n* [[MiG-15]]\n* [[G.91 R/3]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/385705-dassault-md452a-mystere-iia/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== References ===\n<references>\n<ref name=\":0\">\"MD 452 Mystère II.\" ''Dassault Aviation.'' https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/md-452-mystere-ii/</ref>\n<ref name=\":1\">\"The Dassault Ouragan, Mystere, & Super Mystere.\" ''Greg Goebel.'' http://www.airvectors.net/avmyst.html</ref>\n</references>\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dassault}}\n{{France jet aircraft}}"}}
