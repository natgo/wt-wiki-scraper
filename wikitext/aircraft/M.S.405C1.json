In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. A pre-production version of the [[M.S.406C1]], the M.S.405C1 is very similar to the succeeding aircraft.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe M.S.405C1 is a respectable low rank monoplane that primarily suffers from a low ammo count for its armament, with only 60 rounds for its nose mounted 20 mm cannon and 300 rounds per gun for its two wing mounted rifle-calibre machine guns. This means that while it is a good turner, players flying the M.S.405C1 should engage in turn fights in arcade battles sparingly and with allies nearby, as it will need to disengage frequently to reload. Stick to high altitudes and prey on bombers or dive on unsuspecting fighters, especially reserve aircraft and biplanes which are a common sight at this BR and offer little resistance against the Hispano 404 cannon.\n\nPlayers flying the M.S.405C1 should be on the lookout for and take care in engaging faster monoplanes such as the [[Bf 109 E-1]], which can handily out-climb the M.S.405C1 and also has significantly higher ammo capacities for its guns.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n* Can fight against reserve planes, which are easy pickings for its nose mounted cannon\n* Provides players with good first experience for the M.S. line\n* Virtually identical to the succeeding M.S.406C1 for an easy transition\n* Very sturdy structure, can sustain 700 km/h IAS in a dive\n* Good turn fighter among monoplanes at its rank\n\n'''Cons:'''\n* Both the cannon and the 7.5 mm machine guns have very low ammo count\n* The wing mounted 7.5 mm machine guns are lousy once the cannon is depleted\n* No armour or self-sealing fuel tanks\n* No combat flaps, only landing flaps\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
