In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]].\n\nThe MS.406C1 is a good general fighter for newer players (though, experienced pilots should not discount this aircraft). This aircraft has a good climb-rate, is manoeuvrable and retains energy allowing for repeated dive and climb situations. This aircraft performs its fighter role, but with having a [[Hispano 404 (20 mm)|Hispano 404]] cannon installed, it can also take on the role of a bomber-hunter or soft-ground target attacker.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe MS.406C1 retains its energy well and is best utilized for energy fighting or Boom & Zoom situations. This aircraft can be used for head-on attacks using its cannon, however, be careful as the MS.406C1 does not have any armour protection.  It will be best to get a few bursts off at range and then manoeuvre out of the head-on. When using this aircraft in a bomber-hunter role, it is best to avoid flying towards the rear or sides of this aircraft as typically this is where most of the bomber's defensive weapons are pointed.  It is best to come at the front of the bomber from either below or from above (make sure you have energy as if you are near stall speed, you will be an easy target for gunners) and make strafing shots and wait until you are out of gunner range to turn and attempt a second pass.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

A first-class aircraft, it was only inferior in performance in French pre-war service to the D.520. A total of 1,081 were built, more than any other French plane except the Potez 63. The prototype (the in-game M.S. 405) first flew in August 1935, becoming the first French fighter to break the 400 km/h limit. In 1937, it was advertised at the Brussels Air Show as \"the best fighter plane in the world.\" The fourth prototype would be taken into production as the M.S. 406, with 600 aircraft in 12 units at the start of the war, having been taken into operational service in December 1938. During the war, the M.S. 406 proved a fair match for the German Bf. 109: 150 M.S. 406s were shot down in the Battle for France, against 191 confirmed and 89 probable kills by the same make of aircraft. Another hundred were destroyed on the ground. Finland also purchased 40 before the war.\n\n=== Notable pilots ===\n[[File:Rene_challe_portrait.jpg|thumb|none|200px|link=User:U64962917#Challe, René M.P.A.|French ace pilot [[User:U64962917#Challe, René M.P.A|René Challe]]'s first confirmed kill happened while flying a '''M.S.406''' for the French Air Force.]]\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ms_406c1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|NhjHEAM0_Hg|'''Realistic: MS.406C1 [Return of the Baguette!]''' - ''Jengar''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[M.S.405C1]]\n* [[M.S.410]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/2874--en|[Ace Profile] Capitaine Pierre Le Gloan]]\n* [[wt:en/news/847--en|[Historical] The Saar Offensive]]\n* [[wikipedia:Morane-Saulnier_M.S.406|[Wikipedia] Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/392583-ms406c-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer MS}}\n{{France fighters}}"}}
