Each are armed with the same amount of ammunition, which means that all guns will fire together until empty. The Hispano 404 cannon is nose mounted, terminating at the prop spinner.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe M.S.410 is a respectably balanced fighter, able to both turn and energy fight with reasonable performance in both roles. The typical French combo of 7.5 mm MGs and 20 mm Hispano cannon though the spinner allows you to take on even the toughest of targets at your rank with little issue in landing hard-hitting knock-outs.\n\nSome aircraft will be able to outrun you, such as the early German air superiority fighters, and others like the Japanese will be able to outturn you, but very few planes will be able to do both. Use this to your advantage to gain the upper hand in the furball.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Several changes were made to the base design, which included the replacement of the old wing design with a new one, increased and improved offensive capabilities and the replacement of the old retractable radiator with a fixed one, among others. The applied changes resulted in the new M.S.410 being able to achieve somewhat better performance than its predecessor, namely reaching a slightly higher top speed. Right after the M.S.410 entered production, France capitulated in June 1940, halting the production of the aircraft after the fifth machine was constructed.\n\nProduction of the M.S.410 was temporarily halted after the German occupation, but resumed shortly after under German supervision. Before France's capitulation, an order for 500 M.S.410s was placed. Needless to say, this production quota was never met, even under German supervision. In the end, only around 70 examples of the M.S.410 were manufactured, most of which consisted of M.S.406 airframes being converted to the 410 standard. Even then, a large number of these machines were only partially upgraded to the 410 standard, leaving many examples as hybrid models.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5113-development-m-s-410-the-duelist-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!--''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''-->\n{{Skin-gallery\n |market|ugcitem_1000285|M.S.410 (D-3801).jpg|Camo \"D-3801 J-132, 13 Fliegerkompanie\"\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5113-development-m-s-410-the-duelist-en|[Devblog] M.S.410: The Duelist]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/385909-morane-saulnier-ms410c-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer MS}}\n{{France fighters}}"}}
