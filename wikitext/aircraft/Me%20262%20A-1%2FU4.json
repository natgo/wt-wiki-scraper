The mixed ammo belt is a nightmare. The stock ammo line up (HE(M)-T + HE-T + APHE) has only one effective anti-air round, the other two lack the one-shot ability for such a precise weapon. Unlocking the belts and the 'New 50 mm Cannon' should be your highest priority, as the stock cannon has a large dispersion radius which nearly requires the pilot to shoot within 500m for an accurate hit. After this compressor and engine should be the next target as each one improves the acceleration of the \"Pulkzerstörer\" which is due to the design of all ''Schwalbe'' jets just short of awful. The remaining upgrades can be chosen at leisure. The cannon is not prone to overheat and top speed is not something to worry about as the 262 can only reach it with a dive anyway.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Mk.214a (50 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 1 x 50 mm Mk.214a cannon, nose-mounted (32 rpg)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe main tactic to use against bombers is a head-on attack or a long-range shot. Aim for the large fuselage, as the 50 mm HEI-T shell will ''obliterate'' any plane it hits in one or two shots or will knock out the pilot. In a deflection shot from above, a 50 mm HEI-T to the wing almost always shreds the entire wing of the enemy or severely damages the wing to the extent a bomber will be unable to fly. A high dive from behind the bomber will offer the biggest and easiest target, but this should be avoided against the [[B-29A-BN|B-29]].\n\nA common set-up for an advantageous position in the battle is for the Me 262 to speed up to approximately 450 km/h, then immediately climb to the side by utilizing the jet's effective climb rate and energy retention. Continue to climb until you reach around 5000 m then build up speed to hunt down enemy planes, fighters and bombers alike.\n\nCompared to other fighter-jets, the \"Pulkzerstörer\" has an extraordinarily long-range hitting power. A long-range shot can be attempted! Do not be afraid to shoot from up to 1.2 km away, as the 50 mm is very accurate especially when the upgrade is unlocked. Furthermore, AI gunners will not engage you if you are attacking from farther than 660 m.\n\nUnlike the other [[Me 262 A-1a|Me 262s]] the MK 214A has a great bullet trajectory making shots above 500 m (1,600 ft) very easy. Even shots up to 1,500 m (1 mile) are a common feat and unlike the American [[Browning M3 (12.7 mm)|.50 cal M3 Browning]] the hitting power does not decline over distance.\n\nThe Mk 214A 50 mm cannon has extremely low accuracy in stock configuration. Unlocking the upgraded cannon is a must.\n\nWhen used against ground targets other than AA batteries and lightly armored vehicles, the HVAP or AP-T belts will be effective. Medium Tanks will be destroyed by one direct hit with either type of shell from most angles, though the HVAP shells are more forgiving in this area, and can destroy Heavy Tanks if shot in the sides, rear, or roof. Light Pillboxes can be destroyed with a few hits using a high-angle dive (shooting through the roof), and from the side they can be destroyed by 4-5 hits; but in order to make sure you can pull out in time, start firing from a distance away if you want to destroy it in one pass. in Ground battles, use the same tactics. Equipping the AP-T belt is the most versatile if you are unsure of what types of targets you will hunt, as each shell contains an explosive filler which is more likely to detonate ammo or ignite fires in tanks or SPAA's of mixed battles, and will also deal adequate damage to any aircraft, especially if aimed at a larger module like an engine, in which it will explode.\n\n=====Ammunition usage=====\n''Armored Targets Belt A''<br>\nThe AP-T belt is a good omni-purpose round, though expect some shots to pass right through aircraft structures and do no damage. The AP-T contains an explosive filler which can detonate inside the fuselage of a plane or inside of a tank. In most scenarios, the first hit will damage the aircraft (or in rare cases set it on fire), and the second will be the final blow. In Ground Forces, aim for the roofs of tanks or the rear of tanks within 500 meters to be effective. ''A well-placed shot to the ammunition of any tank will detonate the ammunition in most cases''\n\n''Armored Targets Belt B''<br>\nHVAP is extremely effective against ground targets and can penetrate up to 108 mm within 500 meters. However, it lacks any explosive filler. Shots to planes will almost always result in the shell going straight through the plane with little or no damage. That being said; shots to critical components on planes such as wing spars or the fuselage may result in that component being blown off entirely.\n\n''Air Targets''<br>\nThe HEI-T (Minengeschoß) will obliterate any plane on the first or second hit. If even one shell lands on an enemy, the enemy plane is at least critically damaged and will likely crash over time. Only in rare cases will this shell fail to destroy an enemy on the second shot (such as shooting the very end of a wing or elevator, or a heavily armoured fuselage). The B-29 is the only tough nut to crack with this ammunition due to its sheer size; aim for the wings or engines.\n\n'''Aim well, and you will be rewarded.'''<br>\nDo not overcompensate for the lead when aiming for planes- the 50 mm travels very quickly and in most cases (under 600 meters) only a little lead is necessary.\n\n====Specific enemies worth noting====\nAgainst piston-fighters, energy advantage is a must- as with the standard Me262A-1. '''Do not dogfight with piston aircraft'''. Use energy tactics- always boom and zoom. Against fighters it is important to monitor ammunition as the Mk.214a only has 32 shots before a reload is needed. Most passes will only allow you to take 2 or 3 shots before you must reset the position and try again. Head-ons are a viable tactic (some enemies will fear facing a 50 mm and will actively try to avoid doing so), but engage from a long distance- even if you survive the pass, the Narwhal has very fragile engines.\n\nJet fighters are the biggest threat to the Narwhal. All jet-fighters will out-climb and out-accelerate you, and your gun has a very slow rate of fire. Thus, the Narwhal is often seen as an easy target. However, the Me 262 family is known for being manoeuvrable at low-speeds when compared to other Jets at its rank. Use your superior low-speed agility to avoid as many passes as you can, then punish a greedy enemy with a well-aimed 50 mm shell.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
