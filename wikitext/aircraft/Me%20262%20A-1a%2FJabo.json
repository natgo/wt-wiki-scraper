If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIt is basically a modified [[Me 262 A-1a]] and should be played in a similar fashion (air superiorityfighter or bomber interceptor). However, the Me 262 A-1a/Jabo can be brought into Ground RB more effectively than the previous model since it has the ability to carry 2 x 250 kg bombs, 1 x 500 kg bomb or 2 x Wfr.Gr.21 rockets, which can also be equipped in the rare [[Me 262 A-2a]] Sturmvogel.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.
