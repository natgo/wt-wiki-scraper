The armament of the A-1 sub-serie, being four 30 mm MK.108 auto cannons, had a number of drawbacks, such as cycle failures and complex heavy shell ballistics. For these reasons, engineers experimented with different variations as to the weaponry, including a reinforced cannon battery. As such, the Me.262A-1a/U1 modification was created as part of this program. German engineers managed to fit 6 autocannons in the nose: 2 x 20 mm MG.151/20, 2 x 30 mm stock version MK.108, and 2 x 30 mm MK.103 guns. For the latter, they developed shells with a higher initial speed, and the guns themselves had a longer barrel length than the MK.108, as well as an effective muzzle brake - all to improve the ballistics of the heavy shells.  They built a prototype (according to other sources, there were three units), but the project was not entered into mass production. However, one example was flown by one of the most effective jet aces of World War II, Heinz Bär, who flew it at the end of April 1945, and with it, even shot down several Thunderbolts in the skies over Germany.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6386-development-squadron-vehicles-me-262a-1a-u1-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=me-262a1_u1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Me 262 A-1a/U1 Devblog Images\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Me 262A-1a U1 WTWallpaper 001.jpg|\nFile:Me 262A-1a U1 WTWallpaper 002.jpg|\nFile:Me 262A-1a U1 WTWallpaper 003.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|V77eUJjifzM|'''The Me-262 family''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:17 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|d5k2T9FP0bQ|'''Avoid them in frontal attack!''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:33 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|bxalaBFUfb8|'''The Shooting Range #174''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:45 discusses the Me 262 \"Schwalbe\".|V7WNaq8wiqQ|'''{{PAGENAME}} - Squadron Vehicle Overview''' - ''Bacongaming''|n7R9ix6KSfY|''' The Germans were NUTS - {{PAGENAME}}'''  - ''PhlyDaily''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6386-development-squadron-vehicles-me-262a-1a-u1-en|[Development<nowiki>]</nowiki> Squadron vehicles: Me 262A-1a/U1]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/320881-messerschmitt-me-262-a-1a-a-1au4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer BFW}}\n{{Germany jet aircraft}}\n{{Squadron aircraft}}"}}
