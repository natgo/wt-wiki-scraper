In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.39]].\n\nThe Me 262 C-1a Heimatschützer I is a Me 262 A-1a fitted with a rocket booster in its tail. It is intended as an interceptor, climbing very quickly under the power of the booster rocket combined with its two jet engines. However, the boosters have a small fuel supply and shut down minutes after takeoff. Without its booster rocket, the Heimatschützer functions very similarly to the Me 262 A-1a. It has the same armament as the Me 262 A-1.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* 15 mm Steel - Behind pilot\n* 15 mm Steel - Pilot's headrest\n* 15 mm Steel - Between cockpit and fore fuel tank\n* 15 mm Steel - Instrument panel plate\n* 16 mm Steel x 2 - Ammunition protection plates\n* 90 mm Bulletproof glass\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nThe biggest issue of the Heimatschützer I is its poor acceleration across all speeds when the boosters are out of fuel. Thus, the \"Compressor\" and \"New Engine\" modifications should have the highest priority. The default ammo belts are decent, but the high explosive content increases with the new ammo. Because of this, researching the 30 mm Belts modification is not a bad idea. The \"New Cannons\" modification can also be researched to improve the accuracy and reliability of the 30 mm cannons.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|MK 108 (30 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 4 x 30 mm MK 108 cannons, nose-mounted (2 x 100 rpg top + 2 x 80 rpg bottom = 360 total)\n\nThe Heimatschutzer I's cannon armament consists of four nose-mounted 30 mm Mk 108 autocannons. It has the same armament as the Me 262 A-1a. The Me 262 A-1a and the Me 262 C-1a Heimatschützer have the same burst mass of 14.52 kg/s (32.01 lbs/s).\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Heavy armament of four 30 mm cannons\n* Decent energy retention\n* It has a rocket engine, allowing a climb to about 4000 m (13000 ft) within 1.5 minutes\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Slow in comparison to other jets it may encounter\n* Rocket propulsion is limited\n* Its 30 mm guns are not optimal for jet combat, with low muzzle velocity and effective range\n* Without its booster, it is a fairly slow climber\n* Sluggish at high speeds due to control surface compression\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
