In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.''-->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.41]].\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with the [[MK 108 (30 mm)|30 mm MK 108]] autocannon, which has insane damage potential.  With the third greatest in-game burst rate of 14.52 kg/s (32.01 lbs/s) and the great explosive warhead \"minengeschoss\" (=mine-shell) this weapon will vaporize aircraft, especially bombers. But every coin has a flip side and the \"Sledgehammer\" is no exception. The amazing rate of fire is bought with a very short barrel and small propellant charges, resulting in very bad ballistics: The slowest shells with the greatest bullet drop in-game. The Mk 108 makes no compromise, only the extremes.\n\nThe MK 108 is a very bad anti-fighter weapon particular in a jet to jet combat. Bullet drop and slow velocity result in difficult lead shots in ranges above 300 m (350 yds). In manoeuvre fights this trait gets even worse, the high speeds of jet battle push the necessary lead for hitting the target high, very high and in front of the enemy. Training with this weapon-system on a custom battle against random enemies is heavily advised.\n\nThe Sledgehammer cannons have an ammo indicator in the cockpit. It sits directly beneath the compass (the one with the little plane in the middle). A typical bar ammunition counter of the Luftwaffe. The left white column is for the two top auto-cannons. The right one is for the bottom two cannons, this bar is also taller than the left one as the ammo count is different for the two pairs.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* 15 mm Steel - plate behind the pilot seat\n* 15 mm Steel - plate headrest\n* 15 mm Steel - Cockpit for plate\n* 15 mm Steel - Instrument panel plate\n* 16 mm Steel - 2 x plates protecting ammunition\n* 90 mm Bulletproof glass\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nThe biggest issue of the Schwalbe is its bad acceleration across all speeds. Thus \"Compressor\" and \"New Engine\" upgrades have the highest priority. The stock belts are decent, but the high explosive content increases with the new ammo, so including belts into the upgrade route is not a bad idea. The same applies to the rockets. Being able to knockout bases or tanks(direct hit) with these warheads, makes the late game much more easy to win if the last enemies are running or hiding. \"New cannons\" is an interesting upgrade choice as it increases accuracy above 300 m (350 yds), but the MK 108 will still be unable to hit a yarn-door at 500 m (600 yds). Cool-down and jamming is nothing the \"Sledgehammer\" has to deal with, considering the damage potential and low ammo count per gun.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|MK 108 (30 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 4 x 30 mm MK 108 cannons, nose-mounted (2 x 100 rpg top + 2 x 80 rpg bottom = 360 total)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAnti-fighter combat strategies include:\n\n'''Climb''': Self-explanatory, rockets are used to boost oneself up to > 7000 m. Henceforth denying enemy fighters absolute altitude advantage. Of course, this must be followed through to the extreme, as once altitude advantage is gone, so will be the Me 262. Especially high-altitude prop-aircraft will be dangerous foes as jet-engine's power steadily declines over altitude. Whereas turbochargers and superchargers will keep the piston engine's power output steady. Watch out for these particular foes: [[P-47D-25|P-47D]], [[Bostwick's P-47M-1-RE|P-47M]], [[F8F-1B|F8F-1B]], [[Spitfire F Mk 24|Spitfire Mk 24]]/[[Spitfire F Mk 22|Mk 22]], [[J7W1|J7W1]] and [[Ta 152 H-1|Ta 152H-1]], if this strategy is chosen. Commence in classic Boom and Zoom tactics.\n\n'''Aggressive climb''': Useful against pure enemy jet teams\nThe same principle as merely ''\"Climb\"'', however with the twist of actively engaging towards the hostile airfield to intercept with E-advantage enemy fighters. Air-Domination is established beyond the frontline with the prime directive to hinder enemy aircraft (especially jets) to gain any further altitude. If piston aircraft are present, this may prove to be difficult as these machines will be ''on'' or even ''above'' the Me 262 C upon contact. Hostile jets though will again not be on a similar energy state, making them on the first two initial passes easy prey. Good energy management is key though!\n\n'''Rush''': Enemy team energy denial\nThis strategy can prove deadly but will provide similar aggressive team-mates with a better outset once team vs team combat starts.\nStart boosters after spawning and use them to reach maximum level flight speed. Reduce engine throttle before losing a wing! Head straight for the enemy and disturb them in their acceleration & climb. The idea is to either seize targets of opportunity (e.g. AFK climbers, unaware targets) or to confuse the foes to give one's allies the aforementioned better vantage position.\n\n'''Important note'''\n\nRocket boost should either be saved to compete against post-war jets or be used immediately to propel oneself up to 6,000 m before the hostile forces had the opportunity to gain any energy advantage.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Great plane for arcade battles, as it climbs quickly with the rocket boosters and can land to refuel them\n* Boom and zoom is a must with this plane, as it keeps up with all other jets\n* Can use boosters to outrun and out-climb other aircraft\n* Excellent energy retention, can hold onto speed earned from boosters for a good while\n* Good roll rate\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Handling feels Heavy\n* Slow compared to other aircraft at the rank\n* Horrible climb rate if boosters aren't in use\n* Performs significantly worse than the A-1a variant\n* MK 108s are not well suited for jet combat.\n* No airbrakes to slow down\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
