Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nIn general, the Me 410 B-1's flight characteristics are adequate. It can accelerate reasonably fast, and its roll rate is average. However, its turn time is not as good as single-engine fighters (which is to be expected), but it may be able to outturn some other heavy fighters. It does not lock up at high speeds, meaning you can dive on enemies without having to worry about that. Even when approaching rip speed, the flight performance stays largely, the same. The DB 603s are excellent engines, and when spaded, at low altitude, without payload, and flying straight, you should be able to manage 470 km/h. However, at higher altitudes, it can go even faster, thanks to its supercharger, reaching speeds past 500 km/h.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,900 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThis aircraft, like its predecessors, benefits from a large supply of ammo. When performing ground attacks against soft targets, firing the machine guns separately enables better conservation of the more relevant cannon ammo. It is recommended to use stealth ammo for the machine guns and another belt for the cannons that include tracers, as this enables the pilot to easier gauge the 20 mm's trajectory.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

You can control the propeller pitch and radiators, but nothing else. Usually, you can keep the radiators at around 40%, but you may have to increase it to a little past 50% if WEP is engaged, or if your water cooling system is damaged. Unlike the DB 601 from which it was derived from, the DB 603 does not conk out if propeller pitch is increased to 100%, and can be kept there. If your engines are dead and you need to glide back to base, decrease it as needed.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nApril 1944 saw the Me 410 B version replace the Me 410 A on the assembly lines. The main distinction of this variant was its Daimler-Benz DB 603G twelve-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine. The new engines had an increased boost and compression ratio, which allowed a takeoff power of 1,900 hp.\n\nThe aircraft's armament was reinforced. The pair of 7.92 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 17 machine guns mounted in the nose section were replaced with the same number of the more powerful and efficient 13 mm large-calibre Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 131 machine guns.\n\nMe 410 B planes could now have two additional 300-litre fuel tanks suspended under their wing panels, and the main landing gear legs were extended.\n\nJust as it was in the case of the Me 410 A, two main versions of the aircraft saw full-scale production: the Me 410 B-1 high-speed bomber and the Me 410 B-2 \"destroyer\". Various Rüstsatz and Umbausatz kits were used on these aircraft.\n\nThe Me 410 B-1/U2 and the Me 410 B-1/U4 had armament corresponding to the same versions of the A-1 modification: either a pair of 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons (the U2 kit), or a 50 mm Rheinmetall BK 5 cannon (the U4 kit).\n\nThe Me 410 B-2/U2 version of the aircraft had a WB 151 ventral container with two more 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons.\n\nIn addition to the 50 mm Rheinmetall BK 5 cannon mounted in the bomb bay, Me 410 B-2/U4 planes had a pair of 30 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 103 cannons installed. To make room, their 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannon and 13 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MG 131 machine guns were removed. About a hundred such kits were delivered to the Luftwaffe's troops on the front lines.\n\nSeveral more \"field modification kits\" for the Me 410 B-2 were developed for the purpose of fighting Allied bombers. The R2 kit included a WB 108 container with two 30 mm Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 108 cannons. The R3 kit also allowed the mounting of additional 30 mm cannons of a different type (Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 103) in a WB 103 container.\n\nIn addition to a WB 151 container, planes equipped with the R4 kit received two additional 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannons mounted under the fuselage. Planes with the R5 kit received a container with four Mauser MG 151/20 cannons, mounted in the bomb bay.\n\nIn April 1944, several Me 410 B-2/U4 aircraft received a 37 mm Rheinmetall BK 3.7 aircraft anti-tank cannon for trial.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=germany&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=assault&vehicle=me-410b-1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/153154-messerschmitt-me-410-b-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer BFW}}\n{{Germany strike aircraft}}"}}
