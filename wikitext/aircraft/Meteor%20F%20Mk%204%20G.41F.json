Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F performs far better than the [[Meteor F Mk 3]]; it is very similar to the [[Sea Meteor F Mk 3]], but better optimised for high speed flight. When compared to the [[Sea Meteor F Mk 3]], at first glance the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F may seem somewhat unappealing; it has the same mass and thrust, seemingly a very similar airframe, but a higher BR. However on closer inspection the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F improves upon many of the annoyances of the Sea Meteor. The wing ripping speed has been increased by ~150 km/h and the wings have been strengthened reducing the risk of wing ripping in turns; the high speed handling has been improved (via increased in the control surface effective speeds), and drag reduced. These changes allow the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F to achieve higher speeds than the Sea Meteor, and mean you will no longer exceed your wing ripping speed in level flight; and make the aircraft more enjoyable to fly at high speeds.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 600 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F flies very similarly to the [[Sea Meteor F Mk 3]], maintaining the Sea Meteor's good acceleration, speed and climb rate. Flying the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F feels a lot like flying the Sea Meteor and two should be played in the much the same way. Where the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F excels over the sea meteor is in high speed flight , the wing ripping speed has been substantially improved, a high speed handling is better. The wings are also stronger, so while you do still have to be careful at higher speeds you can feel more confident in your manoeuvres than in the Sea Meteor.\n\nIn general boom and zoom attacks work well in the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F, you can dive on enemy aircraft and use your good acceleration and climb rate to get away quickly. If you need to slow yourself down when diving on enemy aircraft the airbrakes should be your first port of call, by keeping the engines spooled up you allow yourself to rapidly accelerate away from your target after an attack. While turn fighting is not generally recommended in jets the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F (like all meteors) does have very good manoeuvrability, which can be used to your advantage in low latitude dog fights. The Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F can also be used as a bomber hunter, being fast enough to deal with early jet bombers, and having the climb rate to be able to intercept high altitude piston engine bombers (like the [[Tu-4]]); however the cannons can leave something to be desired when trying to deal with tougher bombers (particularly if you have the stock ammo belts).\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The prototype F.Mk.4 flew for the first time on May 17th 1945; the new variant was powered by Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.5 turbojet engines, producing 1,590 kg of thrust (more than twice as much as the Derwent Mk.1). The engines were fitted in new extended nacelles, which reduced drag, and a strengthened airframe design was incorporated to harness the increased power. Fitted with the new engines, the Meteor F.Mk.4 would go on to set two world air speed records in November 1945 and then again in September 1946.\n\nFurther modifications to the Meteor F.Mk.4 included its ailerons and adjustments to its rudder trim tab to reduce snaking. The cockpit was now fully pressurized and ventilated; previous versions of the Meteor had had a non-pressurized cockpit.\n\nTrials of the prototype Gloster Meteor F.Mk.4 fighter showed that its maximum speed was increased by 180 km/h, but that this additional speed produced excessive stress on the wings. The wing panels, therefore, were made shorter from the ninth production aircraft onwards. This reduced the stress and improved horizontal manoeuvrability but reduced the rate of climb and the service ceiling. Type G.41F became the designation for the long-wing aircraft, and Type G.41G for the short-wing variant.\n\nThe Gloster Meteor F.Mk.4 represented a significant leap in terms of performance and was produced in large numbers, including as an export fighter. Based on the F.Mk.4, the two-seat T.Mk.7 trainer was developed.\n\nBy 1948 the F.Mk.4 had completely replaced the F.Mk.3 in the RAF and In May 1947, an export version was purchased by Argentina, followed by orders from Denmark, Egypt, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n535 Gloster Meteor F.Mk.4 were produced for the RAF, with a further 168 aircraft being exported.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=jet_fighter&vehicle=meteor_fmk4_lw Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Meteor (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/264951-gloster-meteor-f-mk4-g41f/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Gloster_Meteor|[Wikipedia] Gloster Meteor]]\n* [http://www.airvectors.net/avmeteor.html <nowiki>[Air Vectors]</nowiki> The Gloster Meteor]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Gloster}}\n{{Britain jet aircraft}}"}}
