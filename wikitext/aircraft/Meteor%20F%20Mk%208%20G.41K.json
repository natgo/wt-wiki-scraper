It is capable of dominating the air in air and ground battles.\n\n'''When in air battles:'''\n\nThe Meteor has primarily 3 roles when it comes to air battles: fighter, attacker, bomber. At its br, the Meteor is one of the competitive jet section, not over exceeding in one side but not underperforming either.\n\n'''''As a fighter:'''''\n\nThe Meteor is capable of being on par with many planes at its battle rating. Different from most other British fighters, but the same as the other Meteors and similar to the [[Swift F.1]], it has a Boom and Zoom role when it comes to fighting as it will not be able to turn fight like the [[Vampire FB 5]] or the [[Venom FB.4]]. It should be noted that the Meteor will not outrun most of the enemy jets encountered at its br unlike the Swift F.1. The pilot should maintain energy at all times since the acceleration is not great. When engaging heavier and bigger planes (like enemy attackers and bombers both player and AI) the pilot should always try to maintain either higher altitude than them to make Boom and Zoom or stay under their belly to take advantage of their weakspots ([[Tu-4]] and [[B-29A-BN|B-29]] are the exceptions for belly attacks as they have ventral turrets).\n\n'''As an attacker:'''\n\nThe ordnance the Meteor carries is enough to do some ground striking, destroying pillboxes, enemy tanks, artillery outposts, anti air emplacements, etc. There is no rule on which armament the attacker should use, it all depends on the pilot's discretion, map, battle rating, etc. It is recommended to use ground targets belts due to the AP ammunition but universal belts may be enough to deal with light armoured vehicles and light pillboxes, leaving the ordnance for heavier and more armoured threats.\n\n'''As a bomber:'''\n\nDue to being a jet, it is able to be a lighting strike bomber. This means to fly the Meteor at a really low altitude (also known as lawn-mowing) with bombs (1,000 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.13 bombs are recommended for base bombing) with a 2-4 second time fuse. When the Meteor is on a base, the pilot should drop the bombs really low to the ground to ensure accuracy as no bombsight is able to be used. It may require practice on how and when to drop the bombs. The 2-4 second fuse makes the plane be able to move to a safe zone away from the blast zone. When no time fuse is set, the Meteor will be forced to drop the bombs at a higher altitude or be prompt to be killed in the blast zone with assault fuse.\n\n'''When in ground battles:'''\n\nThe Meteor has only 1 role in ground battles primarily (superiority fighter can be used but it is not recommended to do so), Close Air Support (CAS). The variety of ordnance is enough to be used in all situations depending on the pilot's discretion. RP-3 are launched in pairs (or in salvo depending on the pilots discretion and rocket settings) and will disable or destroy even the heaviest armour encountered with a couple of rockets. The con of rockets is that they are hard to aim, practice will be required. Bombs, on the other hand, are more forgiving when it comes to accuracy as the blast zone is bigger and are able to destroy one or more targets at a time, disable modules (tracks, barrel, engine, etc) or just mark them with fragmentation. The con of bombs is that a fuse might have to be added depending on the way the pilot wants to drop them (lighting strike, dive-bombing, etc), they are also heavier than the rockets, making the attacker more vulnerable to anti-air fire and dogfighting.\n\nWhen it comes to just the 20 mm cannons, it should be noted that most vehicles the Meteor will encounter ([[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]], [[XM-1 (GM)|XM-1]], [[BMP-2]], etc) will have a poorly armoured roof which the armour-piercing shells will penetrate. Heavier targets ([[ZTZ59D1|ZTZ-59D1]], [[T-62]], [[T-10M]]) will only be able to be killed with suspended ordnance as they will not be able to penetrate the roof.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Engines are a massive improvement over previous models, with high speed and acceleration rates compared\n* Great at turning below 650 km/h\n* Good climb rate\n* Controllable roll rate\n* Able to carry suspended payloads (unlike other Meteors)\n* The flight performance is still good when carrying bombs\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Compression\n* Hispano Mk V cannons have poor accuracy, and are borderline unusable when stock\n* Wing controls tend to lose control ability at higher speeds\n* Poor energy retention, struggles to keep up with some aircraft\n* Limited visibility out of the rear of the cockpit\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Production began in 1949 and, after the RAF stood up its first operational squadrons in 1950, export versions were then produced.\n\nThe F.Mk.8 differed in a number of key areas from the F.Mk.4 on which it was based; the F.Mk.8 had an elongated fuselage and the tail assembly was changed, both features incorporated to increase stability. An extra 432-litre fuel tank was also added and a blown cockpit canopy was mounted to increase visibility.\n\nThe F.Mk.8 was powered by Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.8 turbojet engines producing 1,630 kg of thrust. The diameter of the engine's air intakes was increased, adding approximately 100 kg of thrust to each engine, bringing the aircraft's maximum speed to 950 km/h. The wing structure was significantly reinforced, with additional alloy steels being used in the framework. The nacelle structure was changed yet again to improve access.\n\nThe F.Mk.8 had the F.Mk.4's 20mm British Hispano Mk.II cannons replaced by Hispano Mk.V cannons of the same calibre but with a higher rate of fire, reliability and ballistic characteristics. A standard mount to suspend HVAR missiles was provided under the wing panels. The F.Mk.8 was the first Meteor to be fitted with a Martin Baker ejection seat; the pilot's chances of survival in an emergency were significantly increased, but the large headrest impaired his rear view.\n\n747 Gloster Meteor F.Mk.8 fighters were produced by April 1954 and were (at various times) in service with over 40 RAF squadrons. From 1950 to 1955, the Meteor F.Mk.8 was the mainstay of RAF Fighter Command.\n\nThe F.Mk.8 aircraft were also accepted for service with the Air Forces of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands and Syria. Meteors of the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) took part in the Korean War although they were outmatched by the more modern MiG 15; although several MiG 15s were destroyed by pilots of 77 Squadron RAAF, losses were heavier and the Meteor was re-roled to ground attack.\n\nExperience in the Korean War highlighted the fact that, even with significant upgrades to its original design, the Meteor was now outclassed by more modern fighters. Different Gloster Meteor versions were flown in training and auxiliary units until the last Meteor trainers were phased out of service with the RAF in 1965.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=meteor_fmk8 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/264949-gloster-meteor-f-mk8-g41k/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Gloster}}\n{{Britain jet aircraft}}"}}
