Players will soon discover that the MiG-15bis is able to almost out climb any other jet fighter within their battle rating. Likewise, players would also notice that the rudder locks up at high speeds, soon followed by the ailerons, and elevators . The MiG is also sluggish in low speed combat, especially in terms of roll rate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe most common enemies of the MiG-15bis are, of course, the F-86 Sabres, although the Banshee/Panther/Cougar line is also a threat. The MiG's main disadvantage is that its wing is vulnerable to ripping in the rolling turn. The Sabre doesn't have this same issue so don't try to out-roll the Sabre, use your extremely good energy retention to zoom back up to higher altitude and then re-engage in a dive.\n\nThe MiG's hard hitting cannons (x2 23mm and x1 37mm) are a hard learning curve if the players are untrained in the low velocity cannons. Although the damage output is a large benefit.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Consequently, a delegation including the designers A. I. Mikoyan and V. Y. Klimov was sent to Great Britain towards the end of 1946. Their negotiations were successful, resulting in the purchase of two of the most advanced turbojet engines at that time: the Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.V and the Rolls-Royce Nene I/Nene II. The British consented to sell their newest strategic designs easily enough since they believed that the Soviet industrial/technological apparatus could not handle the mass production of sophisticated assemblies. However, very soon that the Rolls-Royce engines were launched into full-scale Soviet production under the designations RD-500 and RD-45.\n\nThe emergence of the new engines led to the creation of Soviet jet fighters able to compete with the leading models of the world. In 1947, the Mikoyan Design Bureau started the development of a front line fighter with a Nene (RD-45) turbojet engine and an airtight cockpit: the I-310 (\"\"S\"\"). The first S-01 prototype aircraft made its first flight on December 30, 1947, and, after working on the test results, was launched into full-scale production in 1948 under the designation MiG-15. The plane's airframe was an all-metal monoplane configuration with mid-swept wings and empennage. Thus the MiG-15 became the first production swept-wing fighter.\n\nThe MiG-15 was equipped with an RD-45F single-shaft turbojet engine rated at 2,270 kg of thrust with a double-entry centrifugal compressor. The plane's armament included a 37mm Nudelman N-37D cannon with 40 rounds and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23KM guns with 160 rounds in total. The cannons were mounted in the forward fuselage on a lowerable carriage. Two 100-kg or 50-kg bombs could be suspended under the wings. To increase its flight range, the aircraft could carry two external fuel tanks with a capacity ranging from 250 to 600 litres.\n\nThe MiG-15 fighter was notable for its simple and reliable structure, high flight and operating characteristics, and powerful armament. Its maximum speed, rate of climb, ceiling, and flight range were the best among Soviet fighters at the time and superior to many foreign aircraft, as well.\n\nThe first production MiG-15s with RD-45F engines began to leave the factory floor in early 1949. In 1950, more advanced MiG-15bis fighters replaced them in the factory assembly lines.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n[[File:MIG-15 BIS In action.png|thumb|none|The German MiG-15bis shooting down a rival [[F-86F-2]] Sabre.]]\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n;<nowiki>Other MiG-15 vehicles:</nowiki>\n\n* [[MiG-15]]\n* [[MiG-15bis]]\n* [[MiG-15bis ISH]]\n* [[J-2]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/195781-mikoyan-gurevich-mig-15bis/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer MiG}}\n{{Germany jet aircraft}}"}}
