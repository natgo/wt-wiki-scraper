It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]]. It is known by many names in the world, with a NATO reporting name of ''Fresco'', the Chinese name [[J-4|''Shenyang J-5 (歼-5)'']], Czechoslovak ''S-104'' and the Polish name ''PZL-Mielec Lim-5''.\n\nBuilding off of the successful [[MiG-15]], the {{PAGENAME}} improves performance and handling to be better able to tolerate the higher speeds common in jet combat.\n\n== General info ==\n[[File:CockpitImage_MiG-15.jpg|thumbnail|right|The '''MiG-17''''s instrument panel.]]\n\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe MiG-17 is a high-subsonic fighter aircraft, it retained the Klimov VK-1 engine that was used by its predecessor, the MiG-15bis. Although the plane is heavier, its level speed performance is slightly improved due to aerodynamic improvements such as a new thinner and more highly swept wing and tailplane. The level speed at sea level is 1,121 km/h, very close to its structural speed limit and over 40 km/h higher than the MiG-15, that makes it very comparable with other jets like the F-86F series.\nThe climb rate performance remained the same: with full fuel tanks it is 50 m/s at very low altitude and 35 m/s above 5,000 m altitude, which puts it on par with the Sabre series but is significantly worse than the British Hawker Hunter F.1 or French Super Mystère B2 with an afterburner that can get to 6,000 m altitude in over two minutes. Since the MiG-17 is heavier its thrust to weight ratio is decreased and it affects its acceleration at low and medium speeds, but at higher speed due to lower drag and more swept wings it is slightly better.\nProlonged usage of maximum power in this plane may cause its engine to overheat after 10 minutes of flight, when the plane is cruising and not in any combat situation it is recommended to reduce it to 95% or 90% which does not have any operation limit.\n\nThe dogfighting capabilities are very close to its precursor, while it is over 200 kg heavier its wing area is also increased, so the wing loading is slightly lower, at low and medium speed its turn rate is slightly worse, but once the plane reaches 750 km/h it gets better. However it still suffers to some extent from compressibility issues near transonic speed. The MiG-17 is still a very dangerous foe to the Sabre series and many other jet fighters, one of its main strengths is performance in vertical manoeuvres. It is also capable of outturning the Sabre, the Super Mystère or Hunter so facing them should not be a problem.\nIts roll rate is practically the same as the MiG-15bis, mediocre at low and medium speed and it can get very bad above 900 km/h. It is very close to 100 °/s at 600 km/h IAS and lowers to ~50 °/s upon reaching 900 km/h IAS.\nThe airbrake is the same: it can help slow down to the speed range where its turn rate is the best. Flaps also have the same speed limit, over 600 km/h in take-off position and 450 km/h for landing, which is quite high, just like its landing gear, which can come very handy when the plane is landing after having taken some damage.\n\nWith full-real controls it is very pleasant to fly, does not have any stability issues at any speed and it is very easy to aim. Its nose will keep dropping until it reaches 850 km/h IAS so it might need some positive pitch trimming below that speed, above that it should be trimmed from -1% to 3%, depending on how fast it is.\nThe stalling characteristics are quite forgiving, after reaching the maximum angle of attack it will not start rolling to any side immediately, but its speed will keep decreasing very fast.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 2,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe MiG-17 should be played like its predecessors, the MiG-15s. In 1v1 situations, the -17 will easily win if played correctly, and due to its superior flight characteristics it is easier to win fights against multiple enemies. You have the upper hand in the initial dogfight, as your great turn will allow you to get on their 6 without much difficulty. However, in a prolonged engagement the chances of you losing increase due to your heavier weight and good, yet not spectacular energy retention. If the player is uncomfortable with dogfighting, the MiG-17 can also be a very effective boom-and-zoom fighter.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The MiG-17 was a further development of the MiG-15 design that had proven itself so well. It was decided to increase the aircraft's speed by increasing the sweep of the wing and the fuselage being lengthened to maintain the centre of gravity. The [[MiG-15]] and MiG-17 show almost no differences at first glance. The prototype of the MiG-17 was even called the MiG-15bis45. However, only the frontal parts of the fuselage are the same, from the air intake to the wing, if you don't count the landing headlight that had been moved to the left wing and some minor details.\n\nThese aircraft are different in every other way. It is easy to see the main differences when you look from above. By comparing the side profiles, you can see that in addition to the difference in fuselage length there are differences in the tail fin and an additional ventral fin which allows you to immediately tell the MiG-17 apart from the MiG-15. The upper part of the fins and the rudders of the aircraft are different, the juncture between the fin and the stabilizer fin also differs, but this can only be seen close up. The wing sweep of the stabilizer fin was also increased and there were also changes to elevators. The air brakes also differ in shape and size. The depth of the housing was decreased, so a cigar-shaped cowl was created to hide the cylinder. There were very significant changes to the wing. Apart from an increased wing sweep, a leading edge break appeared and the tips became rounder, which helps differentiate the aircraft when looking at them from above or below. While the MiG-15 had two aerodynamic ridges on the top surface of its wings, the MiG-17 had three.\n\nThe change in the shape of the wing led to appropriate changes in the construction of the flaps. The new geometry of the main landing gear legs required for the cover to be altered. The structure of the canopy also saw some changes. However, the first versions of the MiG-17 had the same canopies as the [[MiG-15bis]]. Apart from changes to the design of the canopy framing (which is not actually that noticeable from afar), a rear-view mirror was introduced that would allow the aircraft to be recognized from further away. There were no significant changes to the cockpit. Overall, the MiG-17 looks even more aesthetically pleasing and streamlined than its predecessor.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=jet_fighter&vehicle=mig-17 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-block;\"> [[File:MiG-17_Image1.png|thumb|none|300px|A MiG-17 avoiding the rounds from an F-86F-25 Sabre.]] </li>\n<li style=\"display: inline-block;\"> [[File:Mig17vf86.png|thumb|none|300px|A MiG-17 after a hard-earned victory over an F-86 Sabre.]] </li>\n</ul></div>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|OM1wefnHzYM|'''Using The {{PAGENAME}} To Absolutely Dominate!''' - ''Spit_flyer''|amZQtFjHAn4|'''The Shooting Range #82''' - ''Tactics & Strategy'' section at 00:28 discusses the use of the {{PAGENAME}} against ground forces.|8W7zbLuhrM4|'''How to fight the OP {{PAGENAME}}!''' - ''MikeGoesBoom''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;[[MiG-15 (Family)|Related development]]\n\n* [[MiG-17AS]]\n* [[J-4]]\n* [[Shenyang F-5]]\n\n\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[F-86 Sabre (Family)|F-86 Family]]\n* [[F9F (Family)|F9F Family]]\n* [[J29 (Family)|J29 Family]]\n* [[Hunter (Family)|Hunter Family]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/857/|[Devblog] MiG-17]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/285040-mikoyan-gurevich-mig-17/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n\n{{AirManufacturer MiG}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
