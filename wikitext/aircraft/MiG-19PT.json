In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]] and was one of the first three jets to feature guided air-to-air missiles, the other two being the [[F-100D]] and the [[Javelin F.(A.W.) Mk.9]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe main advantages of the MiG-19PT are its exceptional acceleration, great energy retention in a straight line and the very strong climb rate. Aside from the top speed, the aircraft has the raw performance to at least keep up with more modern jets.\n\nHowever, the plane is weighed down by its somewhat inferior manoeuvring energy retention, bad low speed manoeuvrability and poor high speed handling. Compression at high Mach numbers slows the roll rate significantly and makes the rudder nearly entirely unresponsive, though MiG-19PT generally has a very responsive elevator. Despite how the acceleration can make up for it, be careful not to turn excessively, as that will bleed much speed due to the poor manoeuvring energy retention.\n\nThe performance of the plane doesn't suffer too much when it's stock. It can still out accelerate Phantoms and climb from sea level at 1100km/h up to 10km in a single zoom climb without any modifications.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 10,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* 16 mm steel behind the radar\n* 60 mm bulletproof glass in front of the cockpit\n* 10 mm of steel on the pilot's seat\n* 25 mm of steel on headrest\n\nThe MiG-19, like most jets, cannot fly well with damage. However, the wing spars can be somewhat tanky, able to absorb several 20 mms or 12.7 mm rounds, perhaps allowing you to return to the airfield safely to repair. One benefit of the MiG is that the elevators are separate to each other in the damage model, and therefore a hit to the tail causing an elevator loss isn't the end of the world, since the remaining one is good enough to continue the fight. The elevators can also act as damage absorbers, taking the brunt of otherwise lethal damage. Occasionally, you may find that a missile has struck the plane, blowing off an elevator but leaving the plane still flyable. Another point to note is that loss of oil in either engine will rapidly cause engine failure, so it is best to return to base ASAP when damaged.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|NR-30 (30 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 2 x 30 mm NR-30 cannons, wing-mounted (70 rpg = 140 total)\n\nThe MiG-19 carries two 30 mm NR-30 cannons, mounted in the wing roots. Each gun has 70 rounds of ammunition, making a total of 140 rounds. The NR-30 cannons are very fast firing so this is not much ammo, and you can't afford to spray. The guns however are extremely powerful, and only a couple of rounds hitting an enemy aircraft will severely cripple them, if not outright destroy them. The shell velocity is very high and you don't need much lead to hit a target.\n\nThe recommended belts for this aircraft are Ground Targets, they're more reliable than the Air Target belts and tend to take off wings and large sections, and destroy engines with one hit, in comparison to the air target belts which tend to spark or just damage external modules. The ground belts contain APHE rounds with 60 mm of penetration, but it is not really worth going for ground targets as the limited ammunition and high speed of the aircraft makes it very difficult to hit or destroy anything.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|OFAB-100 (100 kg)|OFAB-250sv (250 kg)|R-3S|S-5K}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* Without load\n* 2 x R-3S missiles\n* 2 x 100 kg OFAB-100 bombs (200 kg total)\n* 2 x 250 kg OFAB-250sv bombs (500 kg total)\n* 16 x S-5K rockets\n* 32 x S-5K rockets\n\nThe MiG-19PT can carry two heat seeking R-3S air to air missiles on under-wing pylons. The missiles have a 10G overload with 8.8 kg TNT explosive equivalent, which is enough to nearly guarantee a downed enemy aircraft if they hit. They travel at a speed of 1,000 m/s which is average for air to air missiles. The ideal use-case for the missiles is for a very low-speed or distracted enemy, as it is very easy to dodge an R3S.\n\nThe missiles are IR guided, try to refrain from firing at a target with friendlies in front of you, as the missile may switch onto a friendly. Enemies flying near the sun are also poor targets. It is not recommended to fire at any target pulling anything more than a light turn, since the missile will just lose track and miss.\n\nWhilst it is possible to lock onto a prop aircraft with the R-3S, you usually have to be at nearly point blank range for the missile to lock on, so you may as well use your guns instead.\n\nDespite the below-average accuracy of the S-5K rockets, these rockets can find success with the speedy characteristics of the MiG-19PT to combat ground vehicles. These rockets are best used in hit-and-run tactics. Half or all of the rockets should be fired in a single volley to increase the chance of a hit, and then return-to-base to rearm. It is recommended to attack at a steep angle so the rockets has a better chance to hit the roof of a tank, which are not well-protected. It is also recommended to engage an attack on the rear of a tank.\n\nThe MiG-19PT can be an excellent bomber at low altitudes for its speed allows to escape a 0.5 second time fuze with relative ease at high speeds and possibly avoiding SPAAs at low altitude.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nSince the MiG-19PT has great vertical energy retention and acceleration, you should use this to your advantage. Taking the enemies vertical is the best move as they will quickly lose energy while you can maintain it. The airbrake is also a very effective tool, allowing you to stay behind someone if they try to force you to overshoot and the plane also rolls well enough that you can engage in rolling scissors if need be.\n\nIt is recommended to avoid throttling down the engine as it has an extremely long spool time until it produces max thrust and this will let your opponent get away from you while you struggle to accelerate.\n\n=== Radars ===\n{{main|RP-5}}\n\nThe MiG-19PT is equipped with an [[RP-5]] search and tracking radar. One radar antenna is located in the centre of the air intake, while the other (and the main body of the radar) is located in the nose of the aircraft, above the intake.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[RP-5]] - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Guaranteed<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, detection of a target is practically guaranteed}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n|-\n| 12,000 m || 8,000 m || ±60° || ±40°\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[RP-5]] - Target Tracking Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The maximum range at which a target can be tracked}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The range below which targets cannot be tracked by the radar}}\n! {{Annotation|Azimuth Tracking<br/>Angle|How far to each side the radar can track a target}}\n! {{Annotation|Elevation Tracking<br/>Angle|How far up and down the radar can track a target}}\n|-\n| 4,500 m || 100 m || ±7° || ±7°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Incredibly high rate of climb\n* Hard-hitting guns, low recoil effects due to wing root placement\n* Great vertical energy retention\n* Roll rate superior to the [[MiG-17]]\n* Incredible acceleration from 600-900 km/h, so it is able to regain energy very fast\n* Has a target detection and tracking radar\n* Decent manoeuvrability\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Compresses badly\n* Will be outrun by 10.7s easily\n* Wings can rip when rolling and turning at high speed\n* Only 2 rather underwhelming air-to-air missiles\n* Poor low-speed manoeuvrability\n* Engines are huge; can be easily disabled by enemy fire\n* Radar suite is not as good as the one fitted on the [[Javelin F.(A.W.) Mk.9]] and [[Mitsubishi T-2]]\n* No countermeasures or RWR\n* Low ammo count\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nAfter taking its first flight in 1954, the MiG-19 became a worldwide sensation – it was the first mass-produced aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier in horizontal flight after taking off from the ground. Although it was the most advanced combat aircraft of its day, the MiG-19 also had certain problems with maneuverability, and certain other improvements also took shape that were then used in the upgraded versions of the MiG-19. The fighter received an all-movable stabilizer that significantly improved its flight characteristics, enhanced control and braking systems, and new, more powerful 30mm guns instead of 23mm guns. One of the most interesting modifications was the MiG-19PT fighter-interceptor, which was developed especially for the installation of K-13 (P-3C) air-to-air missiles. This missile was strongly influenced by the extremely successful American Sidewinder, models of which the Soviet Union received from China. The MiG-19PT's flight tests were successfully completed in 1964. The K-13 missile was then used on an entire series of combat aircraft and remained in active use until the end of the 80s. The MiG-19 itself was modernized several times and participated in many armed conflicts. Over 2,000 MiG-19s were manufactured in the USSR, and even more MiGs were manufactured in China: over 4,500 units.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5934-development-mig-19pt-target-locked-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=mig-19pt Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Banking MiG-19PT.png\nFile:MiG-19 PT WTWallpaper 001.jpg\nFile:MiG-19 PT WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:MiG-19 PT WTWallpaper 003.jpg\nFile:MiG-19 PT WTWallpaper 004.jpg\nFile:MiG-19 PT WTWallpaper 005.jpg\nFile:MiG-19 PT WTWallpaper 006.jpg\nFile:MiG-19 PT WTWallpaper 007.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|gfGoEp0HbZc|'''The Shooting Range #137''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|Ygl5x6ASHxQ|'''{{PAGENAME}}- Learning the ropes''' - ''Ash''|S68HXBmOj9c|'''{{PAGENAME}}  [Vertical Monster!]'''  - ''Jengar''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Q-5 early]]\n* [[J-6A]]\n* [[MiG-19S (Germany)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5934-development-mig-19pt-target-locked-en|[Devblog] MiG-19PT: Target Locked]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/436414-mikoyan-gurevich-mig-19pt/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer MiG}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
