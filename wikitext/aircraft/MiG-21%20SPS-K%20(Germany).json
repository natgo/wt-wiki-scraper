The acronym SPS comes from \"сдув пограничного слоя\" (\"sduv pogranichnogo sloya\") which means \"blown flaps\". For this, the engine was modified and received a new name R-11F2S-300, this engine redirected some air from the compressor to the flaps. The military wanted it to be able to take off from unpaved airfields, and these modifications shortened the takeoff run to 480 m on average and reduced the landing speed to 240 km/h. Two SPRD-99 (СПРД-99) boosters could be installed to shorten the takeoff run even more. It was mass-produced from 1961 to 1965.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|YbLIfh0nbfg|'''Should You Buy The MiG-21 SPS-K? - Premium Review''' - ''Sako Sniper''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer MiG}}\n{{Germany jet aircraft}}\n{{Germany premium aircraft}}"}}
