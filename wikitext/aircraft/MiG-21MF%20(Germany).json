In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]].\n\nIt is a single-engine delta-wing supersonic interceptor with conventional tail and fully-moving elevators.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' has mediocre flight performance in every aspect among top rank jets. It will get out-accelerated by British Phantoms or MiG-21 bis, outturned by Draken or Mirage, and out-sped by 2nd gen US Phantoms (F-4E/EJ), Starfighters or MiG-21 bis. The delta wing provides great angle-of-attack (AoA) while turning but it also mean the plane loses huge amount of speed doing so. This means that staying behind enemy in 1 vs. 1 is fairly simple, but when there are multiple bandits one might lose all their speed and become an easy missile target if turning too much.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 13,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nThe MiG-21MF lacks armour plating. It also has one engine unlike some other planes. This means that the survivability is very low, even among jets. Getting hit is something that should be avoided at all cost, because should the plane survive it, even small wing damage will force the pilot to return to base. The plane has a radar warning receiver (RWR), and countermeasures, including flares and chaff.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nYour main priority is to get to the R-60s as soon as possible, this will require you to unlock two tier III modifications. Unless you particularly want to research the ground attack ordnance you will be wanting to unlock \"Wings repair\" and \"New 23 mm cannons\" at tier III. Therefore you should research \"Offensive 23 mm belts\" as your first modification at tier I. This will then unlock tier II modifications where you can research \"R-3S\" and your choice of \"New boosters\" or \"Airframe\" (up to you in which order you unlock these), it may be appealing to unlock missiles first to help with the grind but you should keep in mind that the R-3S missiles are slightly worse than the [[AIM-9B]], which means they cannot be fired in even a gentle turn or climb. Once tier III modifications are accessible, you can unlock \"Wings repair\" and \"New 23 mm cannons\" in whichever order you want and then go for the R-60s. Once the R-60s are available you can unlock the remaining modifications in whatever order you see fit, however it is highly recommended to go for G-suit and engine upgrades first.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nWhile the '''{{Specs|name}}''' itself is a pretty mediocre fighter, it has access to 4 deadly R-60 missiles. These missiles work the best when enemy is slow, so the recommended tactic is to wait a bit before engaging into the battle.\n\nDue to the immense speed bleed in turns, it is strongly recommended to keep the speed high near enemies, unless one really wants to closely meet AIM-9J. Dropping below 800 km/h makes it really hard to dodge this missile. When an enemy is spotted, it is recommended to turn roughly into their direction, so when they engage, they'll have to make a 180° turn, which will give time for MiG pilot to disengage without risking getting hit by a missile.\n\nEngaging in 1 v 1 situation can sometimes be done, but unless a faster opponent forces it (which happens rarely, as faster opponents turn worse than the MiG) it is only recommended if there are no other enemies nearby. However, do never turn-fight with Draken or Mirage. A good tactic for defensive dogfights is trying to make enemy overshoot, especially against Phantoms. Keep in mind however that you can outrun F-4C.\n\n===Specific enemies worth noting===\n\n* MiG-21 bis and MiG-21 SMT, if you play against the Soviets. They are faster and have better acceleration (bis in particular) but are slightly heavier and less agile\n* Mirage IIIC, has very similar acceleration and top speed, but will outturn MiG-21 MF and has great Matra Magic missiles.\n* F-4E/F-4EJ. They are armed with great missiles, fighting them at altitude is not recommended. One the deck they are faster and have better energy retention.\n* J35 Draken, will always outturn you. It is very important to keep an energy advantage when attempting to fight the Draken, turn fighting is the worst thing possible against a Draken and tactics that involve retaining energy is best when attempting to fight the Draken. Forcing the Draken to dump its energy is the best way to fight against it.\n\n=== Radars ===\n<!--{{main|AN/APS-19}}-->\nThe MiG-21MF is equipped with a Sapphire-21 search and tracking radar. The radar is mounted in the nose of the aircraft.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | Sapphire-21 - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Guaranteed<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, detection of a target is practically guaranteed}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n|-\n| 30,000 m<br>(theoretical) || 20,000 m || ±30.0° || -3.0°/+17.0°\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Sapphire-21 - Target Tracking Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The maximum range at which a target can be tracked}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The range below which targets cannot be tracked by the radar}}\n! {{Annotation|Azimuth Tracking<br/>Angle|How far to each side the radar can track a target}}\n! {{Annotation|Elevation Tracking<br/>Angle|How far up and down the radar can track a target}}\n|-\n| 20,000 m || 300 m || ±30.0° || ±17.0°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Operated by the East German Air Force (''Luftstreitkräfte der Nationalen Volksarmee''; '''LSK''') between 1972 and 1990, the aircraft was an export variant of the MiG-21SM, and is highly similar to its counterpart, the [[MiG-21SMT]]. Designated the 'Fishbed-J', the aircraft formed the bulk of the LSK in the late stages of the Cold War. All German MiG-21 aircraft were retired following the German Reunification, though some survive as museum aircraft to this day.<ref name=\":0\">Aviata. (2020)</ref><ref name=\":1\">Museum, D. (2020)</ref>\n\n=== Design and procurement ===\nThe East German Air Force received many MiG-21 variants due to their ties with the Soviet Bloc. 76 MiG-21F-13 aircraft had been delivered to the East German Air Force in the early 1960s, and they later received 50 MiG-21PF 'Fishbed-D' planes, which were known as the MiG-21PFM in East German service.<ref name=\":0\" /> This generated considerable confusion as the German MiG-21PFs had inadvertently been given the same name as the later, Soviet-made, MiG-21PFM 'Fishbed-F'.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, in the early 1970s, the LSK received its first 3rd-generation MiG-21s, the MiG-21MF. This aircraft was essentially an export variant of the Soviet MiG-21SM. 50 MiG-21MFs were delivered to the LSK between 1972 and 1974.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe MiG-21MF differs from the standard MiG-21SM by having a less powerful engine and simplified radar system, meaning that it accelerates slightly slower than its Soviet counterpart. It could reach a maximum speed of 2,230 km/h, and was flown by a single pilot.<ref name=\":1\" /> As an interceptor, it carried a 23 mm dual-barreled cannon with 200 rounds in a ventral pack, and was also capable of fitting a variety of munitions including bombs, rockets and missiles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Service history ===\nThe MiG-21MF enjoyed a fairly uneventful service history with the LSK. The aircraft served with ''Jagdgeschwader'' (JG, fighter group) 8 and JG 9. It complemented the earlier MiG-21PFM and MiG-21F-13 aircraft in German service. Later on, it was complemented by the MiG-21bis, the final MiG-21 variant to serve with the German Air Force. At the time of the German reunification, many MiG-21s remained in German service.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> As the new combined ''Luftwaffe'' had no plans to continue using the Soviet-era interceptor, all MiG-21 aircraft were retired in late 1990 following the German reunification. Many of those aircraft were reserved as museum pieces, and several survive to this day in museums across the globe.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=mig-21_mf Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:MiG-21MF.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|oMWZhOXmQYg|'''\"MiG-21MF - The Orange MiG [Air Forces]''' - ''BaconGaming''|vhTZXYk6eao|'''Tank busters''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:19 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|DwixJCfFMU8|'''MiG-21MF''' - ''Napalmratte''|R8lBSC7IFUM|'''Should You Buy The MiG-21MF??''' - ''Sako Sniper''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* {{Specs-Link|mig-21_f13}}\n* {{Specs-Link|mig-21_smt}}\n* {{Specs-Link|mig-21_bis}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21|[Wikipedia] Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]\n* [http://www.airvectors.net/avmig21_1.html <nowiki>[Air Vectors]</nowiki> The Mikoyan MiG-21 - MiG-21 Single-Seat Variants]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/479893-mig-21mf/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n=== Works Cited ===\n\n* Aviata.
