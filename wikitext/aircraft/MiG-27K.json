This variant of the MiG-27 differs from previous versions mainly through the inclusion of an onboard laser designator and compatibility with TV-guided weapons systems.\n\nThe MiG-27K is a variant of the MiG-27, a ground-attack aircraft derived from the earlier MiG-23. Compared to the MiG-23, the MiG-27 featured a revised downward-sloping nose, leading the aircraft to be nicknamed \"Balkon\" (\"Balcony\") because of its improved frontal visibility. The aircraft also had simpler non-variable intake ramps and a fixed engine nozzle, leading to weight savings. In accordance with its ground attack role, the MiG-27 lacked a radar and was instead fitted with ground attack systems.\n\nThe MiG-27K followed the previous MiG-27M as the ultimate variant of the MiG-27 in Soviet service. The most notable change was the addition of a laser designator and targeting pod in the nose of the aircraft. Additionally, the aircraft gained the ability to carry TV-guided munitions. In total, roughly 200 MiG-27Ks were built for the Soviet air force.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[MiG-23 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/534250-mig-27m/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer MiG}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
