Unlike the standard variants of the Mirage, the Milan received a pair of retractable canards on its nose section in order to improve the aircraft's low speed handling characteristics and shorten take-off distances. In addition, the aircraft was fitted with an uprated ATAR 9K-50 turbojet engine as well as a laser rangefinder.\n\nDassault manufactured a total of three Milans, basing them both on the Mirage III and Mirage 5. Tests of the various prototypes all showed notable improvements in the areas targeted by the aircraft's modifications. However, the canards also caused issues with the normal operation of the air intakes as a result of their turbulence generation.\n\nRegardless, Milan competed in the Swiss tender against both the A-7G as well as the G.91Y, but failed to impress the Swiss Air Force sufficiently to enter service, same as her competitors though. In 1972, Dassault stopped all further work on the Milan project and shifted its attention to the development which resulted in a more advanced version of the Mirage. The Dassault Milan undertook its final flight in March 1976.\n\nThe Mirage Milan represented in the game is a Mirage IIIR (reconnaissance variant) modified to carry canards.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7698-development-dassault-milan-the-flying-mustache-en|[Devblog] Dassault Milan: The Flying Mustache]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dassault}}\n{{France jet aircraft}}\n{{France premium aircraft}}"}}
