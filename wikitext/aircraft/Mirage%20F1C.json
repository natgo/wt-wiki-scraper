Try to stay behind your team and target slow and distracted enemies using the powerful air-to-air missiles. Considering the poor top speed and manoeuvrability of the Mirage F1C, it doesn't stand much chance in duels against most enemies, even against uptiered fighters.\n\nThe F1C also makes a surprisingly good strike aircraft due to its ability to carry larger bombs compared to its ground-striking peers such as the Mirage 5F or even the Jaguar.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\nEvery fighter at the BR is a threat for the Mirage F1C because of its slow acceleration and bad elevator and rudder response.

Among them, a smaller swept wing design of the Mirage outfitted with the latest and more powerful SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine garnered the interest of Dassault engineers as a possible future replacement to the existing Mirage III and Mirage 5 fighters.\n\nConfident in the design, Dassault began conducting further design work under the official name Mirage F1 as part of a private venture. In late 1966, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight and the initial test results proved to be rather positive. In late 1966, the French Air Force also expressed interest in the aircraft and officially adopted the development programme. Subsequently, the Air Force ordered a small batch of pre-production aircraft to be built in April 1967. After Dassault persuaded the Air Force to accept the Mirage F1 into service in order to make the aircraft also marketable to foreign operators, the first production order for the aircraft was issued in 1969.\n\nEntering official service with the French Air Force in March 1974, the Mirage F1 took part in their first combat operations a decade later flying sorties against insurgent forces in Chad. Mirage F1s also took part in French operations during the Gulf War in 1990. In the late 2000s, French Mirage F1s also supported international forces during operations in Afghanistan.\n\nApart from France, several other nations such as Greece, Spain, South Africa, Qatar, Iraq, Morocco, and many others, operated variants of the Mirage F1.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=mirage_f1c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nMirage_F1C_WTWallpaper001.jpg\nMirage_F1C_WTWallpaper002.jpg\nMirage_F1C_WTWallpaper003.jpg\nMirage_F1C_WTWallpaper004.jpg\nMirage_F1C_WTWallpaper005.jpg\nMirage_F1C_WTWallpaper006.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Ru7TKQXZQGs|'''The Shooting Range #297''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:28 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7610-development-mirage-f1c-a-break-from-tradition-en|[Devblog] Mirage F1C: A Break from Tradition]]\n* [https://www.dassault-aviation.com/en/passion/aircraft/military-dassault-aircraft/mirage-f1/ <nowiki>[Dassault Aviation]</nowiki> Mirage F1]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Dassault}}\n{{France jet aircraft}}"}}
