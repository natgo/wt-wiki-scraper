The large engine that covers almost half the length of your fuselage is very vulnerable to damage which will significantly decrease your power output as well as the massive wings that will lose a large amount of lift when damaged.\n\nThe plane includes an RWR (Radar Warning Reciever) which can be rather helpful.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n''In Air RB it is recommended to climb use your decent radar and Matra R530 Semi-Active Radar Homing missile against unsuspecting aircraft (such as Harriers, A-5C'', F-5C, Mig-21S and more). The R530 has pretty good range and can hit opponents coming head on even when launched from the maximum distance the missile allows (~12km, 7.5mi at ~5km, ~3mi altitude or more) while also being agile enough to hit targets that try to maneuver at higher altitudes.\n\nThe aircraft also comes with the Matra R530E which is the infra-red variant of the R530. It can be used at medium range at high altitude (preferrable side-on) but having access to two AIM-9D missiles that are superior to the 530E which could be traded for bombs or the regular R530 which also has all-aspect capabilities makes it a missile that you will rarely use.\n\nThere is also the Shafrir-2 infra-red homing missile which despite it featuring a caged seeker head has great manueverability as well as a long motor burn time. Despite that, the missile has a relative short range, having difficulty hitting targets going the same speed as you at low altitude.\n\nThe AIM-9D is one of the longest-range missiles of the AIM-9 family, featuring a motor and aerodynamics almost identical to the AIM-9G/9H with an inferior seeker head and gimbal limits. It can effectively destroy aircraft 5-6km rear aspect at ~5km, ~3mi altitude or more with the only drawback being that it is angled downwards with a caged seeker before launch making it slightly harder to use.\n\nThe aircraft itself features a powerful engine and a delta wing configuration which allow it to accelerate at a decent rate and have great maneuverability but the control surfaces at higher altitudes are less responsive. \n\nIn summary, a valid tactic is to start climbing at 20-25 degrees once you take off until you reach an altitude where your missiles can use their full range at the start of the battle, use your radar to lock on an enemy and fire your R530 hopefully scoring a kill while avoiding sharp turns and doing your best to keep your speed high. Having high speed not only makes it harder for enemies to catch or use their missiles to hit you, it also makes your missiles have an even longer range. Once you see that there are no more enemies at your altitude, there is most likely either a few running people on the enemy team left or there is a furbal. In both cases you have the ability to sneak up on the enemy from your higher altitude and fire your missiles off scoring even more kills. One thing to keep in mind though is that the AIM-9D pulls too much lead when fired off from side-aspect so it will be easier to dodge.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Greatly maneuverable \n* Good air-to-air missiles\n* 30 mm DEFA cannons are deadly at close ranges \n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Bleeds speed fairly quickly in sharp turns\n* No countermeasures (no flares or chaff)\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
