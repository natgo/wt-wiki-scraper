In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.73 \"Vive la France\"]].\n\nThe N.C.223.3, as a derivative of the Farman F.220 plane model, looks strikingly similar to the [[F.222.2]] bomber, yet different as well. The biggest difference is the twin rudder on the tail that helps improve stability and yaw control. The plane's overall design was also made more aerodynamic as part of the improvement, the nose section is made a tad shorter, and the plane uses Hispano-Suiza 12Y-29 engines rather than the previous Gnome Rhone model. Defensive armaments were also improved with two Hispano cannons as the rear ventral and dorsal turret armament.\n\nThe N.C.223.3 is made distinctive with its push-pull engine configuration, stacking the engine on each side in tandem for the effect where the forward engine \"pulls\" the plane while the rear engine \"pushes\" the plane. This lowered the amount of engines having to protrude from the wing, while keeping the engine centreline so that one failed engine in a side will not prevent the other from providing a similar thrust force.\n\nIn the default camouflage scheme, the N.C.223.3 is coated in the French standard aircraft tricolour camouflage, which consisted of Vert (Green), Brun Mat (Matt brown), and Gris Bleu foncé (Dark blue gray). The underside of the aircraft was painted in Gris Bleu Clair (Light blue gray). The French roundel is present twice on the left side, one on the N.C.223.3 fuselage and one on top of the wing. Final note of appearance is the French national tricolour markings on the tail plane and rudder.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Combined with its frequent presence in Ground Strike matches with only light vehicles, it will make short work of any (or even all) groups of armoured cars and AAA it crosses paths with. However, the ability to carry larger bomb loads later in its upgrade tree turns it into an exceptionally capable base killer, often time wiping out bases solo. As of update 1.97, 5 of the 200 kg No.1 bombs can destroy a base, so with the upgraded bombload you should be able to easily destroy 3 bases, and keep all 12 100kg No.1 Bombs for the enemy airfield, or to destroy the fourth base in some maps . However, it is still capable of turning entire columns of medium tanks to flaming scrap if escorted in higher level battles, with Hispano gun turrets available if an enemy tries to attack the plane.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This aircraft was based on a successful earlier design of the F.211 which was a parasol wing, four-engine monoplane utilizing tractor and pusher engines.  While the F.211 never entered production, it served as a base for the F.220 to be designed and built from. The first successful flight of the F.220 happened on 26 May 1932.\n\nThe F.220 was a success in of itself, however, Farman made several modifications to improve the design which included a new vertical stabilizer, rebuilding the nose and ventral turret to fully enclose them and upgrading the old V-engines to new radial versions. After these modifications, the new version of the F.220 made its maiden flight in 1933.\n\nIn 1936, another variant, the F.222 first flew and this bomber incorporated retractable landing gear which reduced drag and was not available on earlier versions. A total of twenty-four aircraft of this version where produced and began service in Armee de l'Air in 1937 and was tasked with performing night bombings raids over Germany in May and June of 1940.\n\nThe F.222.2 bomber which is featured in the game had a redesigned nose and changed out the engines from Gnome-Rhône 14Kdrs engines to Gnome-Rhône 14N-11 engines.\n\nThe later F.223 which came after the F.222 saw significant changes, not only to name as it became NC.223 after Farman was absorbed into Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Centre (SNCAC) which was the nationalization of both Farman Aviation Works and Hanriot in 1936. The aircraft's tail section was reworked and went from a single vertical stabilizer to a twin-stabilizer setup and the fuselage was refined to be more aerodynamic. Another upgrade came in the form of changes to the ventral and dorsal turret weapons. The Mle 33 7.5 mm machine guns were replaced with the more powerful H.S. 404 20 mm autocannons.\n\nOn 7 June 1940, a variant (NC 223.4) of the French Naval Aviation was the first allied bomber to fly into Germany and bomb Berlin, the flight dropped eight 250 kg and 80 x 10 kg bombs on Germany's capital. While the ordnance was not much, the psychological impact was the goal and the raid was reproduced three days later. NC 223 bombers continued to serve in bombing roles until June 1940 when they were transferred to North Africa to fulfill the role of transport aircraft.\n\nThe one in-game was a bomber version with different, weaker engines than the original NC. 223 (910 hp Hispano-Suiza 12Y-29 engines instead of the 1,100 hp engines on the NC. 223). 8 of them were built.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=nc_223_3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|N-EazLEFaFg|'''The Shooting Range #71''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:33 discusses the N.C.223.3.|J9nUjFDdk-E|'''The Shooting Range #131''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:23 discusses the N.C.223.3.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5095-development-nc-223-3-let-nobody-leave-unsatisfied-en|[Devblog] NC.223.3: let nobody leave unsatisfied!]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/385686-nc-2233/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Farman}}\n{{France bombers}}"}}
