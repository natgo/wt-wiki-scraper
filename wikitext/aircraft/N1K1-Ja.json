It will struggle to out-run or out-climb most fighters at its BR, but can make use of some nice features such as its extremely good medium-speed manoeuvrability and strong armament.\n\nFirstly, the N1K1-Ja is slow. It's top speed is barely 600 km/h in a straight line when spaded, meaning that it will be outrun by almost every fighter at its BR, and even by some bombers too. Thus, boom & zoom will not work with this plane due to its low speed. However, the N1K1 does have a key advantage, being its great mid-speed manoeuvrability. Though it isn't as manoeuvrable as the famed A6M 'Zero', it can easily out-turn most enemies it commonly faces, save for aircraft from its own country and a few Spitfires. When in battle, utilize the N1K1-Ja's good mid-speed (350-450 km/h) manoeuvrability to win dogfights with enemies it commonly faces.\n\n==== Tactics ====\nAt the start of the battle, climb up a decently achievable altitude of 3000-4000 metres. Of course, be aware that many enemies (such as the [[Spitfire F Mk IXc|Spitfire]], [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf-109]] and [[I-225]]) will be able to climb faster than you. Once at altitude, look for targets to engage. Bombers are great targets as they will be shredded by the N1K1-Ja's large main armament; however, beware of their defensive guns, as the N1K1 doesn't have great armour protection and will easily be pilot-sniped or set on fire. Against other fighters, utilize your turn rate to your advantage, as the N1K1 is rather disadvantaged in most other regards. Force enemies to turn fight at slightly higher speeds, where their turn rate will be impeded.\n\nWhen being pursued by other aircraft, there are several strategies to use. Firstly, against faster aircraft such as the [[P-47D-25|P-47]], [[P-51D-30|P-51]] or [[Fw 190 A-5/U2|Fw 190]], allow them to dive on you and then turn out and force them to enter a turning engagement with you. If the pilot decides to climb and disengage, there isn't much you can do as they have (typically) better climb rate and energy retention. Do not follow them up the climb, it is a death trap. Instead, disengage and fly away to engage someone else. Against more manoeuvrable targets such as the Spitfire, a variety of tactics must be used as the Spitfire can out-turn the N1K1 at lower speeds.\n\n==== Specific enemies to take note of ====\n\n* [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]] / [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]]: This duo of American fighters, though not entirely similar, can be countered with a similar playstyle - just try to force them to turn, especially at lower speeds. The P-47 is simply horrible at turning, while the P-51 is designed for higher speeds and thus lacks low-speed manoeuvrability. Don't bother trying to follow them, especially if one has made a B & Z attempt on you and is running away - your top speed is a solid 100 km/h slower than theirs.\n* [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]]: The Fw 190s are also extremely dangerous opponents, having an excellent roll rate and great diving capabilities. Again, try to force a turnfight, as the Fw 190's turn rate is even worse than the P-47's. If they try to disengage by pulling roll-heavy manoeuvres like the scissors, do not follow them. They can out-roll you by a significant margin.\n* [[Spitfire LF Mk IX|Spitfire]]: The famed Spitfires are extremely hard to deal with, as the Merlin-powered ones can out-turn you while the Griffon-powered ones can out-run and out-climb you significantly. Against these aircraft, the best option is to simply seek the help of teammates, as the N1K1-Ja will likely lose against a Spitfire in a dogfight.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This version flew on 27 December 1942 powered by a Nakajima NK9A Homare 11 18-cylinder radial engine, replacing the less powerful Mitsubishi MK4C Kasei 13 of the [[N1K1]].\n\nAs the navy canceled its orders on the Kyōfū, Kawanishi was opted with 3 choices:\n\n* Repurpose the [[H8K2|H8K, Type 2 Flying Boat]] as a land-based bomber\n* Create a new carrier based fighter\n* Repurpose the [[N1K1|15-shi (N1K, Kyōfū)]] as a land-based fighter\n\nKawanishi decided to further promote development of the land-based fighter version. Even though some Navy engineers showed concern that Kawanishi wouldn't be a suited designer of land-based planes due the few experience they have on land, the plane still showed great potential and was quickly evaluated by the Navy. Aside from engine problems stemming from rushed engine development and some landing gear issues, the Navy was thoroughly impressed as its speed was far faster than the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]] and its maximum range was beyond that of the [[J2M (Family)|Raiden]] and ordered its production as the '''N1K1-J, Shiden'''.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=n1k1_ja Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|v8iCEAEtszE|'''The Shooting Range #39''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 00:24 discusses the N1K1-Ja.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n;[[N1K (Family)|Related Development]]\n\n* [[N1K1]] - (Kyofu Model 11; Base hydroplane model)\n* [[N1K2-J]] - (Shiden Kai Model 21; Redesigned wings and fuselage)\n* [[N1K2-Ja]] - (Shiden Kai Model 21A; More powerful engine, larger prop)\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/3753-development-n1k1-ja-violet-lightning-en|[Devblog] N1K1-Ja : Violet Lightning]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/315756-kawanishi-n1k1-j-ko/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kawanishi}}\n{{Japan fighters}}"}}
