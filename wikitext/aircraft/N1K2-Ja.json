It can face early jet fighters such as the [[F-80A-5]], [[Yak-15]]/[[Yak-17|17]], [[He 162 A-2|He 162]], [[J21RA|J]]/[[A21RB|A21R]], and in Arcade, the [[F-84B-26]]. These jet aircraft hold a hefty speed advantage over the ''Shiden-Kai'', but typically have very poor manoeuvrability, meaning the N1K pilot can abuse its excellent handling at medium speeds and shred the previously mentioned jets if their pilots are foolish enough to try and turn-fight. The one exception to this is the Yak-15, which retains the turning abilities of its airframe; the [[Yak-3]]. However, the Yak-15 suffers from a relatively low top speed and climb rate for a jet, along with sub-par vertical energy retention. Above all those, its ammunition pool is abysmal at only 120 rounds total, meaning the N1K2 pilot could potentially win an engagement just by remaining difficult to hit.\n\nAlthough it can fight admirably against jets, the N1K2-Ja will find itself coming up short against many of the other nation's top tier superprops. It cannot keep up with the [[P-51H-5-NA|P-51H]], [[F4U-4B]], [[F8F-1B|F8F]], [[I-225]], [[La-9]], [[Tempest (Family)|Tempests]], [[Spitfire (Family)|Griffon Spitfires]], [[G.56]], [[Bf 109 (Family)|late Bf 109s]], or [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190 D's]] of its tier. Fortunately, most of the previously mentioned aircraft cannot turn with the N1K2, so the ''Shiden-Kai'' can use its superb mid-speed manoeuvrability to turn circles around its opponents. The main exception to this is the uncommon G.56, which is the closest thing the N1K2 has to a hard counter. It can turn with it, outspeed it, out-dive it, beat it in an energy fight and shred it with the triad of 20 mm MG 151s, so it is highly recommended to either avoid the G.56 or take it out while it's preoccupied with a teammate.\n\nThe N1K2-Ja can take on a relatively new role for Japanese fighters; a fighter/bomber. With its ability to mount up to 4 x 250 kg bombs or two of the massive Type 5 No.6 rockets, the N1K2 can be Japan's best ground attacker and will make enemy tanks quake in fear. The Type 98 Number 25 bombs are roughly equivalent to the American [[AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M64A1]] 500 lb bombs, and are all mounted on wing racks, allowing for precise bomb placement on targets. On the flip-side, the Type 5 No.6 rockets have no direct comparison but play somewhat similarly to a watered-down American [[Tiny Tim]] rocket or Swedish [[hprak m/49]] rocket. Despite their relatively low velocity and higher weight, they are still quite accurate and are able to be launched quite close to the target with minimal threat of self-damage.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The main difference between the two planes was the 21Ko's steel underwing pylons. This Shiden-Kai could carry four 250-kg bombs, two under each wing, or two 500-kg bombs, or two or four 60-kg bombs. It could also carry unguided rockets, like the N1K2-J.\n\nThe N1K2-Ja could be visibly distinguished from its predecessor by the lower position and reduced area of its horizontal fin.\n\nUpon its success in factory testing, the N1K2-J was selected by the Japanese Imperial Navy as its primary fighter and fighter-bomber. The Navy's plan was to launch large-scale mass production of the Shiden-Kai, but its production was always behind schedule. The situation became more critical when American B-29 Superfortress bombers began attacking Japanese industrial sites. The attacks did not target the production facilities containing the Shiden-Kai assembly lines, but supply companies were attacked, leading to a shortage of sheet metal, forged steel, stamped aluminum, and engine and chassis parts.\n\nN1K1-J fighters were first used in battle near Lake Sebu in October 1944, then used en masse in the Philippines. From the end of 1944 on, the N1K1-J and N1K2-J aircraft were primarily used for the defense of the Japanese homeland.\n\nThe most famous squadron of Shiden-Kai was formed in December 1944. Known as the 343rd Kokutai, it was under the command of the most experienced Japanese naval commander, Minoru Genda. His squadron consisted of Japanese aces, and their planes were all N1K2-Js. This \"Genda's Blade\" squadron was known as a squadron of experts, the elite of the Imperial Navy's aviators. The Americans quickly felt their skill in battle. For instance, in February of 1945, Midshipman Kaneyoshi \"Kinsuke\" Muto, piloting an N1K2-Ja, single-handedly attacked 10 F6F Hellcats, shooting four of them down and forcing the others to retreat.\n\nThe Shiden-Kai was an extremely unpleasant surprise for the Americans. The original Shiden was good, but this model, free of its predecessor's \"childhood illnesses\", was superb. It would soon become clear that even a pilot of average skill in a Shiden-Kai could challenge any Allied fighter, even the P-51 Mustang, which began its fight in the skies over Japan in the spring of 1945.\n\nProduction of the N1K2-J ended after Japan surrendered. In all, 1,435 Shidens of all variants were constructed, including 998 N1K1-Js and 415 N1K2-Js.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=n1k2_jko Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n{{Skin-gallery |market|ugcitem_1000528|N1K2-Ja Fictional Trainer.jpg|Camo \"Primary Trainer\"}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;;Related Development\n* [[N1K1]] - (Kyofu Model 11; Base hydroplane model)\n* [[N1K1-Ja]] - (Shiden Model 11A; N1K1-J with 7.7mm's removed from the fuselage and 4x20mm in the wings)\n* [[N1K2-J]] - (Shiden Kai Model 21; Redesigned wings and fuselage)\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/285073-kawanishi-n1k2-j/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kawanishi}}\n{{Japan fighters}}"}}
