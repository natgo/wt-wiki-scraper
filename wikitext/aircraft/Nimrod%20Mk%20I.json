It is also a highly manoeuvrable. Being slow makes it easy prey to faster fighters, but that's where the manoeuvrability can come in play to avoid being a easy prey for superior fighters and make them bleed their energy.\n\nLike [[Fury Mk I]], [[Fury Mk II]], and [[Nimrod Mk II]], the Nimrod Mk I is lacking in firepower, only armed with two [[Vickers E (7.7 mm)]] machine guns. Lacking in firepower doesn't mean it's useless, most aircraft at the battle rating are very lightly or not armoured at all which makes even the Vickers able to shoot down engaged aircraft with some ease, though not as efficient as [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]] with its four machine guns.\n\nEnemies to be aware of are aircraft like [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]] and [[Ki-10 (Family)|Ki-10]] which are able to out-turn the Nimrod and in the case of the I-15 being able to outgun it. Another aircraft to be wary of is [[He 100 D-1]] being able to out-run and out-gun the Nimrod, it will mostly use its superior speed to make passes on the slower aircraft.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In early 1930, Hawker Aircraft Ltd built two prototypes, which initially had the unofficial name of \"Norn\", at their own expense. In serial production, the aircraft came to be designated the Hawker Nimrod.\n\nIn early 1931, the first Hawker Nimrod prototype was sent on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle to Buenos Aires as part of the British Empire Trade Exhibition. The first production fighter's maiden flight took place on October 14th 1931. By 1932, Nimrod Mk.I fighters began to replace the Fairey Flycatcher in Great Britain's Fleet Air Arm squadrons, at this point still under the control of the Royal Air Force. The Nimrod first entered service with 408 Flight onboard HMS Glorious in November 1931, followed by 402, 404 and 409 Fleet Fighter Flights in 1932.\n\nThe aircraft was equipped with a 590 hp, liquid-cooled, Rolls-Royce Kestrel IIS engine.\n\nThe main external differences between it and the Hawker Fury were its strong landing gear legs with longer-stroke shock absorbers, its enlarged fin, increased wingspan and the extended area of its forward fuselage's metal skin. Flotation devices were fitted in the upper wing and the fuselage tail section to help the aircraft to remain afloat in the event of a forced landing on water. Stainless steel parts were incorporated in the wing and engine mount fittings to protect against corrosion. For carrier take off and landings, the cockpit was shifted forward slightly to improve visibility, although the first Nimrods to enter service were not equipped with an arrestor hook. Float-type landing gear could also be installed on the aircraft.\n\nThe Nimrod's armament consisted of two synchronized 0.303 inch Vickers Mk.IV machine guns with 600 rounds each mounted on the forward fuselage. The aircraft was able to carry up to 80 lb (36 kg) of bombs on underwing hardpoints; usually this was made up of four 20 lb (9 kg) bombs.\n\nAfter the first Nimrods entered service, 19 of the fighters were equipped with arrester hooks, catapult fittings, and a pilot seat headrest fairing to ease catapult strain. Subsequently, some of these modifications were made to aircraft which had been produced earlier.\n\nA total of 57 Hawker Nimrod Mk.I fighters were built.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=nimrod_mk1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Hawker}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
