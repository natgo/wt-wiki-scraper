In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British naval fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe Nimrod Mk II is a rank I plane for Britain. It is a biplane with 2 x 7.7 mm Vickers machine guns. The main difference between it and the Mk. I is the slightly swept wing and more powerful engine. It is statistically on par with most other Reserve planes of all countries and eras. Climb rate, turn rate, roll rate, and acrobatic ability are superb, mostly due to the Nimrod being a biplane.\n\nThe Nimrod is basically a point-and-shoot aircraft in arcade battle. It is intended mainly for beginners with little to no experience in War Thunder. Being a biplane, the Nimrod is very forgiving and thus is very flexible in techniques and tactics. Turn rate provides players with a thrilling beginning in Arcade, and the roll rate and climb rate provides for some interesting acrobatics with the Nimrod. Armament, naturally, is very weak. The 2 x 7.7 mm Vickers are only effective when used to snipe pilots. Against bombers the Vickers MGs are useless.\n\nAlthough RB puts things into a bigger perspective, the Nimrod plays very similarly to Arcade. Point and shoot and turning are most common with biplanes such as the Nimrod. Endurance is very good given the high ammunition count, and turn, roll, and climb rates are very good. RB with the Nimrod is a great first taste of actual RB play with more specialised planes.\n\nSB with the Nimrod provides a great chance to have the first taste of Simulator Battles. The open cockpit provides beginners with a thrilling experience in the skies, and of course, mechanics are identical to RB. Especially the gun sight provides unique gameplay for beginners.\n\nOverall, the Nimrod provides a pleasurable beginning experience for players who have recently begun the game.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

By 1934, full-scale production of Nimrod Mk I fighters was replaced by that of Mk II fighters. All Nimrod Mk IIs were fitted with an arrestor hook for carrier operations, their wings were modified with a slight sweep back and tail surfaces were slightly larger than those of the Nimrod Mk I. The powerplant was also improved in the Mk II; a 608 hp Rolls-Royce Kestrel V liquid cooled, in-line engine replaced the earlier 590 hp engine. Only 30 Nimrod Mk IIs were build for service in the Fleet Air Arm, although many of the Mk Is were updated to Mk II standard.\n\nHawker Aircraft Ltd failed to receive significant export orders for the Nimrod; only four machines were sent abroad, including one supplied to Japan, one to Portugal, and two to Denmark. The Danish fighters were known as the Nimrodderne.\n\nIn 1933, the Fleet Air Arm's units were reorganized. Independent flights were combined into Squadrons, which were numbered from 800 up. Hawker Nimrod fighters were in service with No. 800 (HMS Courageous), 801 (HMS Furious) and 802 (HMS Glorious) Squadrons, with two flights of nine Nimrods in each. The command structure again saw change following the 1937 Inskip Report, when naval aviation was handed back from the Royal Air Force to the Royal Navy, and Britain's Nimrods became the property of the Admiralty.\n\nThe Hawker Nimrod fighter was replaced in first-line units by the Gloster Sea Gladiator and the Blackburn Skua before the start of World War II. Nimrods continued to be operated as training and liaison aircraft until July 1941, by which time they had long been considered obsolete and were taken out of service. The Danish Nimroddernes were used until the German invasion in April 1940, but did not see combat against the Luftwaffe.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=nimrod_mk2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Hawker}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
