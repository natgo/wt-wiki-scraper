If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nGenerally, to do well in the P-26 never, ever turn fight, as it has a huge turning radius compared to other reserves. Ideally practice \"Boom & Zoom\" tactics, that is climb above, dive in, attack, climb up again for a new attack. Also, use the \"Stealth\" ammunition belt, it is the hardest hitting belt for this aircraft and targets will not see where you are, giving you another second or two advantage. Stealth is harder to use, but it's worth it. While a mediocre at best reserve fighter, it is a very good ground attacker carrying 2 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs with 24.5 kg of TNT each, which is effective against even some Rank 3 tanks and Rank 2 ships.\n\nQualify the crew to \"Expert\", it is very cheap and invest Crew XP points in Pilot Vitality (i order to be able to resist injury) and Weapon Maintenance, good to take and give damage.\n\nStudy your opponents, this is critical on how to counter them as there is no single way to counter all targets. The Japanese Ki-10 and Soviet I-15 are this aircraft's greatest threats, if they get on your six evade like crazy and hope they overshoot (never turn); teammates are also very helpful. Bombs with 0.5 seconds delay could work. Others like the German He 51 you could outrun them, but do not turn. With higher BR units you may be just able to outmanoeuvre, but the best is constantly scan the sky for threats. Other rank 1 aircraft vary in threat level. Besides fighters, attacking bombers is a viable option, however, be mindful of defensive turrets as there are a few 12.7 mm machine guns and 20 mm cannons out there.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Should generally be replaced as soon as more advanced planes become available\n* Slow compared to contemporary fighters, but faster than reserve biplanes\n* Engine and fuel fires are next to impossible to extinguish due to wooden/canvas construction and lack of self-sealing fuel tanks\n* Fragile, especially to high-explosive rounds from enemy autocannons\n* Slower machine gun fire rate compared to Soviet aircraft\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nMany problems were revealed when the P-26's operation began. Due to its narrow landing gear tread and a landing speed too fast for its time, the aircraft was prone to nose over. When this happened, the pilots often lost their lives, although the planes themselves were not seriously damaged. As a result, the fuselage spine fairing was redesigned. Its height was increased by 20 cm, and the reinforced structure could endure a load of more than 12 tons if hit. The 29th production P-26А was the first to obtain this enlarged fuselage spine fairing, and the planes already produced were modified directly on the front lines.\n\nNew wing flaps allowed the aircraft's landing speed to be reduced. The plane was also equipped, in the event of an emergency landing on water, with two inflatable sacks occupying the containers in the wing roots. Beginning at the 26th production aircraft, this equipment became standard for the P-26А, but it was not installed on the aircraft already produced. There is no documented evidence that this system was ever used for its intended purpose, but one aircraft crashed after the raft kit opened spontaneously during flight.\n\nP-26Аs produced later had reinforced armament: one synchronous 7.62 mm Browning M1 machine gun to the left of the fuselage and one synchronous large-calibre 12.7 mm Browning M2 .50 cal machine gun to the right. The magazine capacity of the large-calibre machine gun was 200 rounds.\n\nA combined total of 111 machines of the P-26A variant were produced. The 20th Fighter Group was the first in the USAAC to be armed with Peashooters. It was followed by two more: the 1st Fighter Group based in Selfridge, Michigan, and the 17th Fighter Group at March Air Force Base, California. At various times, P-26s were operated in 22 USAAC fighter squadrons.\n\nPeashooters were flown by many pilots who later occupied high positions in the USAAF and then in the USAF, including Henry Harley \"Hap\" Arnold, future Commander-in-Chief of the USAF.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=p-26a_34 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Polikarpov [[I-16 (Family)|I-16]]\n* Mitsubishi [[A5M4]]\n* Dewoitine [[D.500]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Boeing}}\n{{USA fighters}}\n{{USA premium aircraft}}"}}
