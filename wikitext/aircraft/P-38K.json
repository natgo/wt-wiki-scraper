If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe main and only tactic of the P-38K is, solely an air superiority and it excels at that.\n\nWhen playing the P-38K, climb to a high altitude, search for the enemy and locate an enemy you feel confident in engaging. Assuming you are above the enemy target, put the aircraft into a gradual descent, which allows you to maintain a speed advantage. As you are descending; make small corrections on your path so you don't give the element surprise away by overshooting the enemy. Now you are about one to two seconds away from your target. Here you will line your sights up, with your sights on the tail and fire a burst with your cannon and machine guns. While keeping the momentum, climb back up to the height you where before and repeat for the best results.\n\nThis plane does not carry any bombs or rockets, so using it in a ground strike role is not recommended.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Though use them on and off)\n* Cockpit visibility, important in simulator matches, is mostly unobstructed\n* Acceleration is great deference when escaping and/or evading enemy aircraft\n* Excellent Silver Lion and Research Point earner\n* Best Boom & Zoom P-38 in-game\n* Great air superiority aircraft\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Wing fuel tanks easily catch on fire when shot\n* Unable to dive to put wing fires out without breaking wings\n* Very delicate airframe, will not take much damage and it is easy to rip wings in dives, no air/drive brakes installed\n* Easy to blackout if crew G-force and stamina are low\n* Single armament preset: No external bombs or rockets\n* When throttling up very fast to WEP, it can cause plane spin/unstable due to the engine torque\n* Low cannon ammunition amount, compared to other planes in the rank\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nThe concept of the plane was made in February 1937 when the US Army Air Corps made a requirement for a plane that had twin-engine and can act as a high-altitude interceptor that can hold a large amount of armament and ammunition. The term \"interceptor\" was used for the aircraft by the requirement authors, 1st Lt Benjamin S. Kelsey and Gordon P. Saville, to bypass the Air Corps' strict requirements on aircraft designs at the time. The specifications laid by this new requirements also called for a maximum speed of 360 mph (580 km/h) and able to climb to 20,000 ft altitude in six minutes, making it the toughest specifications at the time. Design proposals were made for the specifications, one of which would become the [[P-39N-0|Bell P-39 Airacobra]], but it was the Lockheed design team headed by Hall Hibbard and Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson that made the final product. They made many designs with a twin-engine configuration. The prototypes made for the design used a twin-boom design to hold all the components of the aircraft. Various armaments were tested on the aircraft, from different machine gun combinations and autocannons. It was finally settled to four M2 .50 cal machine guns and one Hispano 20 mm autocannon. The aircraft armament configurations, all at the nose of the aircraft, was very unusual for American aircraft design, as most of their designs and those of their foreign contemporaries had the armament mounted on the wings angled forward. Because of this mounting, the aircraft is able to fire at a longer distance accurately than wing-mounts.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=p-38k Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|zn2uhgI2PPg|'''Best twin-boom aircraft''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 04:39 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* Northrop [[P-61C-1|P-61]] Black Widow\n* Savoia-Marchetti [[SM.92]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/288271-lockheed-p-38k/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lockheed}}\n{{USA twin-engine fighters}}\n{{USA premium aircraft}}"}}
