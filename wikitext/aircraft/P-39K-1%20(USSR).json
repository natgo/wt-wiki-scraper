The first was that the P-39 was intended for export, and there was no way around this. The impossibility of fitting a turbo compressor to the low-altitude Allison engine (for fully explicable reasons) was one reason why the aircraft was never able to achieve a worthy place in the US air forces. The nature of air combat, both in Europe and the Far East, prevented the P-39 from making use of its advantages, while it was not possible to rectify its main drawback - its poor high-speed performance - because of the ban on exporting turbo compressors outside the USA.\n\nThe second global problem was connected to a technical failure in the production of the 20 mm Hispano-Suiza AN-M1/M2C cannon by the Bendix company. This was the first problem the Bell specialists tried to tackle. The Bell specialists initially tried to solve this problem themselves. The virtually unusable 20 mm cannon was replaced by the old, heavy but more reliable Colt-Browning M4. The cannon had a lot of faults, mainly its low rate of fire and extremely inadequate stock of ammunition - only 30 shells. On the other hand, in spite of its weight, it could easily be fitted in the front part of the Cobra's fuselage; furthermore, it has one incomparable advantage over the Bendix product - it actually fired.\n\nIt must be noted that the M1 cannon was not always fitted onto the first series of the P-39, you could find the M4 here and there. Only the Model 26 (P-39G) carried the M4 as standard equipment. However, it did not go into production, but became the founder of a whole number of virtually identical series from P-39K to P-39Q. The main units were borrowed from the quite promising P-39D-2 series.\n\nThe P39K differed from the earlier models in its engine, the Allison V-1710-63, which was successfully tested in that same D-2. It was fitted with an afterburner system. It developed a nominal power of 1352 h.p. and 1550 h.p. in WEP (War Emergency Power) mode. The K series was the only one fitted with such an engine along with a three-bladed Aeroprop propeller. It was a full 360 kg heavier than the D-2, although externally, apart from the propeller, there was no visible difference. In fact, the extra weight was due to additional armour plating, which was used beginning with the K and on all subsequent series.\n\nAltogether, by August 1941, 210 examples of the series K-1-BE, K-2-BE and K-5-BE, which were virtually identical, were built. Forty of them were sent to the USSR.\n\n=== Notable pilots ===\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-block;\"> [[File:Alexander_Pokryshkin_profile.jpg|thumb|none|200px|link=User:U64962917#Pokryshkin,_Alexander_I.|[[User:U64962917#Pokryshkin,_Alexander_I.|Alexander Pokryshkin]] flew the '''{{Specs|name}}''' during the battle of Kuban starting his 47 kill-streak with the [[P-39 (Family)|P-39]] series lend-lease aircraft.]] </li>\n</ul></div>\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=p-39k_1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|k0xWIrlYSr4|'''The Shooting Range #55''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:35 discusses the Soviet P-39.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/86399-bell-p-39k-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Bell}}\n{{USSR fighters}}\n{{USSR premium aircraft}}"}}
