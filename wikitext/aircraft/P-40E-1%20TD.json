In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"New Power\"]] as a [[wt:en/news/6968-more-twitch-drops-en|reward for watching War Thunder streams on Twitch.tv]] along with a unique skin for the vehicle.\n\nThe P-40E Warhawk is an excellent \"boom-n-zoom\" fighter/bomber, however, it is not limited to this kind of warfare. It is equipped with 6 x M2 Browning .50 cal machine guns which are remarkably effective against light pillboxes, some light tanks/AAA, and of course, planes. The P-40 can also equip bombs to round itself out as a decent low-rank fighter bomber.\n\nAny competent realistic battle Warhawk flyer will tell you that it is only good at Medium altitudes (3,000 m is normally considered that middle altitude). This is because the engine's performance is poor at higher altitudes, unlike its future successors- the [[P-51D-5|P-51]] and P-47. The P-40's main asset is its straight-line speed- it will easily outrun Bf 109s, A6Ms, and some \"modernized\" biplanes you may see at its 2.3 battle rating. Head-ons are almost never advisable, but given the high velocity and fire rate of the .50 cals, lightly armoured planes such as the A6M can be taken head-on from a distance.\n\nOtherwise, use the high speed and decent engine performance at low altitude to out-speed and energy-fight enemy planes. At high speeds, the P-40 can out-turn a select few Axis and British fighters, including some lower-rank Bf 109s and Hawker [[Hurricane (Family)|Hurricanes]]. Never attempt to turn with Zeros, He 112s, Spitfires or low-rank Soviet fighters as they will almost always have the turn advantage and get the better angle of attack.\n\nIn short, the P-40 is one of the best performing low-rank US planes due to its high speed and general performance which outmatches most, if not all, opponents at the 2.3 battle rating.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe P-40 is a very good mix of everything. It accelerates well, has good manoeuvrability, nice turn time and withstands from 12 to -5 G. It behaves best below 550 km/h.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,810 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

While not as devastating as a 20 mm autocannon, the six machine guns when connecting with a target will do a considerable amount of damage, to the point of causing a critical hit if not blowing off a wing or severing a fuselage. Unlike aircraft with nose-mounted weapons, the wing-mounted guns require the pilot to set a convergence point. Typically a convergence point is set around 250 - 400m (or even closer if you typically fly on the enemy's tail) will be enough to thoroughly dismantle an enemy airplane. Though the guns can be pushed to fire at aircraft which are further away, however, they start losing their punch and chances of critically damaging the enemy starts dropping. Due to the issue of convergence, head-on attacks are discouraged unless the pilot is proficient at cantering the aircraft slightly so that one set of guns fires in a straight path towards the head-on attacker.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|AN-M30A1 (100 lb)|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* Without load\n* 2 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs (200 lb total)\n* 1 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bomb (500 lb total)\n* 1 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bomb + 2 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs (700 lb total)\n\nAs an early version of a multi-role aircraft, the {{PAGENAME}} can be configured as a fighter/interceptor or a fighter/bomber. Bombs can be outfitted to the {{PAGENAME}} to allow for strategic bombing and low altitudes, many times during a diving run. Less effective at bombing bases, this fighter can lob the bombs to pick off smaller and lighter targets which may be spread across the map and once the bombs are released, it can resume its fighter role. The disadvantage of carrying bombs on this aircraft come with reduced manoeuvrability. The roll rate of this aircraft dramatically changes when carrying the two 100 lb bombs under the wings, however, the single 500 lb bomb though heavier, with its being mounted on the fuselage hardpoint it doesn't affect the roll rate as much.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Air combat in RB'''\n\nThe P-40 is good at turn fights and low altitude fights only against fighters like Bf 109s it faces, e.g. the [[Bf 109 E-3|E-3]], [[Bf 109 G-2|G-2s]] and [[Bf 109 F-4|F-4s]]; these aircraft cannot really turn with it but are faster. The speed of this aircraft at 560 km/h makes it pretty fast for its rank and BR, however, this is only applicable to low altitudes. An important point is that the aircraft engine chokes above 5,000 m and becomes basically a sitting duck at this altitude.\n\nWhen you dive on other planes, watch your speed. The P-40 is nearly uncontrollable at speeds higher than 600 km/h, its ideal speed is between 400 and 500 km/h. However, structurally, the P-40 is surprisingly strong and can turn/dive very quickly at high speeds.\n\nCompared to other planes at the 2.3 battle rating, the P-40 is fairly well-armed. The 6 x M2 machine guns can rip apart most enemy aircraft. A well-trained burst can take any fighter, however, some attackers (namely the well-armoured [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]]) and larger bombers might take a little bit more patience and a few more passes. Ammo capacity is also very good and will easily last an entire RB match, given that the pilot has good accuracy and trigger control.\n\n'''Air combat in SB'''\n\nThe P-40 can be used for BnZ fighting, bomber hunting and ground pounding in Sim. It is a decent plane with distinct pros and cons. Its heavy firepower of 6 x 12.7 mm MGs can critically damage the enemy and rip it apart. It also has great dive speed and decent level speed, capable of outrunning slower opponents like A6M. However, it is a nose-heavy plane so unlike other planes, the P-40 has to trim the elevators upwards. It has extremely limited visibility with lots of canopy frames and a razorback design which obstructs the backwards visibility. The P-40's over-the-nose visibility is one of the worst due to its big, long engine, and the small intake on top of the cowling, making leading very hard. Moreover, its engine tends to overheat frequently even with 95% throttle, meaning you have to cut throttle a lot to avoid damaging the engine.\n\nBefore entering a battle, it is recommended to set keybinds for trimming and vertical head movements to improve the forward visibility a bit. Take at least 30 minutes of fuel. Set the convergence between 250-500 m, with vertical targeting on.\n\nFor dogfighting, because almost all aerial battles in Sim occurs at below 3,000 m, the P-40 can easily climb to this altitude and gather up lots of speed before engaging a battle. The tactic is similar to the RB one above, which is to keep speed and boom and zoom. If, unfortunately, you find yourself being chased on your six and you don't know how to do any defensive manoeuvres, do a large, smooth turn towards the nearest friendly airfield to avoid bleeding too much speed. Then shallow-dive towards your airfield. The P-40 can quite easily outrun opponents like the [[A6M (Family)|A6M]] or [[I-15 (Family)|I-15]], but struggles to outrun [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109 F/Gs]], [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190 A]] or other [[P-40 (Family)|P-40s]]. Another way of disengaging is to do a sudden Split-S to dodge under the chaser. Average Sim players will now try and see where you went, if not immediately losing track of you. You can then run for your airfield or shallow climb for another attack.\n\nYou want to be more careful when hunting bombers, since with the Sim control (whether it be mouse joystick or a real stick) the plane will manoeuvre much more gently, making itself a great target for the bomber's gunners. DO NOT follow behind a bomber's six unless you are sure that its tail gunners are unconscious. Chasing behind a bomber makes yourself pretty much stationary for the tail gunners, and you will be showered with bullets. The engine of the P-40 will usually get damaged. Instead, before launching an attack, get an altitude advantage over the bomber by flying around 2 km above it. The bomber should only fill up about 1/6 of your gunsight. The best position for an attack is at the bomber's high six so you can adjust the lead much easier. Dive at the bomber, but not directly at it, try to predict where you two will crash by imagining yourself as a missile, that's where you should aim at (deflection shooting). To maximise the damage it is better to aim for their wings and engines, as the fuselage usually soaks up quite some bullets. Only fire when the bomber passes in front of your guns. This short window might seems inadequate to do anything, but the six MGs on the P-40 are actually pretty destructive, as sometimes it only takes one bullet to set the target aflame.\n\nIn short, always remember to energy fight and use the P-40's high top speed to quickly dive away and leave combat if things get hairy.\n\n'''The Ground Attack Role'''\n\nThe P-40E can carry a bomb payload of 2 x 100 lb or 1 x 500 lb or 2 x 100 lb + 1 x 500 lb (700 lb), making it a decent ground attack fighter for its rank. The Ground Targets belt for the .50 cals allow the P-40 to rip apart enemy AAA, Pillboxes, and even most German/Japanese light tanks. [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]]s, [[BT-5]] and [[BT-7|-7]]s, [[Chi-Ha]]s, etc., can all be torn to shreds with the .50 cals- primarily from the side and top. Note that in SB, the P-40 will wobble a lot (sideways mainly) so you must get used to smoothing the plane down in order to hit ground targets.\n\nSome concerning fighters that the P-40E-1 should worry about are:\n\n* Bf 109s: [[Bf 109 E-3|Emil]]\n* [[A6M2|A6M2]], the \"Zero\"\n* [[Yak-1B|Yak 1B]]/[[Yak-7B|Yak-7B]]\n* Spitfires: [[Spitfire Mk IIb|Mk.II]], [[Spitfire Mk Vb/trop|Mk.Vb]] )\n* Hurricane Mk IVs with mounted cannons\n\n'''Against the [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109]]:'''\n\nTurn flight- the BF-109 is typically a superior aircraft in terms of climb rate and vertical manoeuvres. However, early/mid-rank 109s can be turned against in the Warhawk, especially at higher speeds.\n\n'''Against the [[A6M (Family)|Zero]]:'''\n\n*Boom & Zoom - dive on the target and engage. Due to its lack of armour and large fuel tanks, the A6M is easy to destroy.\n*Outrun the A6M- the A6M isn't a really high-speed plane, the P-40E can outrun it flat-out easily, so turn around after 3-4km and try to head-on or start climbing then. The A6M might start to climb to try and gain energy- if you keep running from it, you will put enough space between you and your opponent to climb to an acceptable altitude, or re-group with allies\n\nNever, ever, ever turn fight a Zero. Zeros are the natural and historical nemeses of Allied aircraft, it can manoeuvre way better than the P-40s and those 2 x 20 mm cannons can rip them to shreds\n\n'''Against the [[Yak-7B|Yak-7]]:'''\n\n*Turn fighting is recommended as a last resort, especially with the Yak-1B's superior handling and turn-radius. You will not be able to outrun a Yak and head-ons are not advised due to the Yak's nose weapons. Try and get a friend to assist you, without losing speed- avoid engaging and losing speed, otherwise, the Yak will catch you. If you are in a squad, stick together and use the scissor-baiting method, until an opponent locks onto one of you, then you can destroy it. Boom and zoom should be used, but the circumstances often don't arise.\n\n'''Against [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]]:'''\n\n*Try to Boom & Zoom, if given the position to do so. In a straight line, the P-40 will outrun a [[Spitfire Mk Ia|Spitfire Mk.I]] at lower altitudes, but not out-climb it. The performance of the Spitfire makes it a difficult enemy, only turn fight with it at high speeds, with wingmen or more teammates around is the optimal solution. The {{PAGENAME}} is also more heavily armed than a Spitfire, so attempting to risk a head-on shot may pay off, especially since both aircraft have to deal with convergence issues. However, skilled Spitfire pilots will not be baited into such a shot and will usually break off before an effective firing solution can be achieved.\n\n'''Against the [[Hurricane Mk IV]] (mounted with cannons)'''\n\n* Do not go head-on! This specific vehicle has the most potent cannon installed on a fighter at or around this battle rating. Any tactic that is not a frontal attack is effective. Something else to note that is the Hurricane Mk. IV's controls will lock up at slower speeds than the {{PAGENAME}}'s in the vertical, thus giving the P-40 an advantage when making high-speed manoeuvres while diving. However, the Hurricane is much more manoeuvrable even with the gun pods installed and can reverse the roles if the attacker is not careful.\n\n'''Against the [[H6K4]]/[[B18A]]'''\n\n* These bombers all have fairly deadly defensive guns. The H6K has a powerful 20 mm cannon facing backwards, so avoid tailing it from its six unless its gunner is unconscious. Engage from its sides or high six and aim for its wings. Your 6 x 12.7 mm MG will destroy its wing structures easily or set it aflame. For the B18, their 13.2 mm MG will easily snap the P-40's wing off with a short burst so avoid attacking them from behind. Utilise deflection shooting against them, to give their gunners little chance of targeting you.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The P-36 was a formidable aircraft, but top speeds of newer fighter designs were quickly passing it. Donovan Berlin a former Northrop engineer who was employed by Curtiss went to work on the redesign of the Hawk. The radial engine was replaced with a turbo-supercharged version of the Allison V-1710 inline engine. The cockpit was moved to offset the weight of the new engine. This delivered a performance boost and higher top speeds when tested. The Army ordered thirteen versions of this prototype built for additional testing. Unfortunately, the experimental turbo-supercharged engine was unreliable and poor visibility from the cockpit forced the project to be abandoned.\n\nThe next attempt at design was a simpler one. Berlin recognized the U.S. Army believed they only needed a fighter effective to only 15,000 ft. The aircraft's engine was replaced with a simpler supercharged Allison engine and was designated XP-40. The new prototype first flew on October 14, 1938. The aircraft flew and looked good but various adjustments were quickly made. These included moving the radiator and a more powerful version of the Allison V-1710. The XP-40 was quickly recognized for its good handling and dive speeds.\n\n===Procurement===\nOn April 26, 1939, Curtiss was handed a record-setting contract of 524 P-40s for $13 million. The primary reason Curtiss won the contract was due to availability. Other manufacturers still needed a couple of years before they could launch their aircraft into production (Examples: P-38, P-39). The first production P-40 rolled off the factory line in March of 1940. The first P-40s to see action were RAF Tomahawks over North Africa in June of 1941. The aircraft was quickly noted for being a stable gun platform and capable of withstanding more battle damage than its counterparts. The aircraft's altitude limitations quickly forced pilots to accept they would have to endure higher flying opponents.\n\nWhen the P-40 reached the D and E variants many changes had to be made. Allison redesigned its V-1710 and the aircraft's fuselage when need to accommodate the higher thrust and additional horsepower from the new engine. Curtiss removed all armament from the nose of the aircraft and placed four 12.7 mm Browning M2 machine guns in the wing. In the later E model that number would be increased to six. The P-40 was also fitted with an improved cockpit enclosure, larger windshield, and a better canopy. The P-40E-1 was also capable of carrying six small bombs under the wings. In late production models, a small dorsal fin was added near the base of the tail for added stability.\n\n===Design===\nThe Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawk was an American single-engine, single-seat, fighter/ground-attack aircraft that first flew in 1938. Better known as the \"Warhawk,\" the P-40 series design was a modification of the previous Curtiss [[P-36A|P-36 Hawk]]. The Kittyhawk was used by most Allied powers in World War II and remained in the front lines until the end of the war. It was the third most-produced American fighter, the first two being the [[P-51D-5|P-51]], and the [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]]. Production of the Kittyhawk ceased in November of 1944. By that time, 13,738 has been built.\n\nAlthough many models of the P-40 were built, the model series was officially given the general name \"P-40 Warhawk,\" making all planes off the P-40 series P-40 Warhawks, although British and Soviet air forces gave the Warhawk the name \"Tomahawk\" for any models equivalent to the P-40B and P-40C. The name \"Kittyhawk\" was given to any models equivalent to the P-40D and above.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe P-40 series first saw combat not in North America, but in the Middle East and North African campaigns, being flown by British pilots, during the June of 1941. No. 112 Squadron Royal Air Force was one of the first squadrons to operate the Warhawks, (Considered \"Tomahawks\" by the pilots that flew them,) and was the first unit of Allied forces to use the \"Shark Mouth\" decal, copying similar German markings that were used on some [[Bf 110 (Family)|Messerschmitt Bf 110s]].\n\nThe P-40 was inferior to some German single-engine fighters in high-altitude combat due to its lack of a two-stage supercharger. This caused the P-40 to be rarely used in operation in Northwest Europe. But between the years of 1941 and 1944, the P-40 played a critical role in the theatres North Africa, the Southwest Pacific, and China. It also had a considerable role in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Alaska, and Italy. The P-40's bad high-altitude performance did not matter in these theatres, where it was used as an air superiority fighter, bomber escort, and a fighter-bomber. Although the design was considered mediocre in postwar, suitable for only close air support, Allied pilots reported the P-40 flew surprisingly well as an air superiority fighter. The P-40 also had the advantage of low-cost assembly, which kept it in production as a ground-attack aircraft long after it was considered obsolete as a fighter. A survey conducted in 2008 showed that at the time, 29 P-40s were airworthy.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nAllied forces have used this American single-engine fighter all over the world: in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Pacific theater. P-40E-1 'Kittyhawk' modification of that plane, made for the British Air Force, was equipped with an Allison V-1710-39 engine and armed with six 12.7 mm. Browning machine guns. The plane could optionally carry 500 pounds of bombs under its fuselage and 100 pounds of bombs on each wing. There were more than 1,500 P-40E-1s produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=p-40e_td Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|LpJHSzP3Y9I|'''P-40E-1 TD \"Worst Piggyback Ride Ever!\"''' - ''Bo Time Gaming''|6pkgIZ8Isgw|'''Twitch Drop plane P-40E-1TD''' - ''8Bit Dane''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* Curtiss [[P-36 (Family)|P-36]] Hawk\n* Curtiss [[P-40 (Family)]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* Bell [[P-39 (Family)|P-39]] Airacobra\n* Reggiane [[Re.2001 (Family)|Re.2001]]\n* Macchi [[C. 202 (Family)|C. 202]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Curtiss}}\n{{USA fighters}}"}}
