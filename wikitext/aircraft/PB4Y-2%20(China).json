Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThere are two ways you can go about playing the ␗PB4Y-2 Privateer, side climbing or diving.\n\n;Side climbing\n\nSide climbing is the safest way of going about. Start by spawning with your Heavy Bomber air spawn, and climb away from the battle. This will give your fighters enough to time to climb up and duel with the enemies. After you see most of the enemies at low alt, you are safe to go in and bomb a point and return-to-base. With side-climbing, the chance to reaching the bombing point is significantly higher as altitude is gained and it becomes less likely the enemy fighters will locate the PB4Y-2. However, side climbing will take up a lot of time and can end with the game ending before reaching the bombing point, or the team decimated.\n\n;Diving\n\nShallow diving:\n\nDiving is probably the most risky way of trying to bomb but it is the quickest if you do it right. Start by spawning in then dive at about -10 degrees. This will make sure you will not overspeed before reaching the bombing point. However enemy interceptors with air spawn can potentially catch you in a head on, which is an extremely dangerous situation.\n\nSteep diving:\n\nUpon spawning, dive at an angle of about -40 degrees. The PB4Y will gradually pick up speed to around 500 km/h. Once you reach 580 km/h, cut throttle to avoid over speeding. If you are close to the bomb base, turn into shallow diving or level out and prepare for the bombing. Once bombs are out, bank towards your airfield while keep diving, you should fly at no more than 100 m above the ground.\n\nDiving will also remove the defensive blind spot on the belly when staying low, as it is less likely a fighter will intercept from below. If a fighter decides to come down and attack, they lose their altitude and so friendly fighters can pounce on them more easily. However, the last point of fighters coming down may end up attracting the whole enemy team, and dealing with a swarm of enemy fighters is no one's desired outcome. At a low altitude, ground elements like anti-aircraft could also have a better chance of hitting the plane.\n\nDuring an encounter with enemy aircraft, if you have time to adjust your position, try putting the enemy plane at your 10 / 2 o'clock. This way you can utilise up to 8 M2 Brownings scattered across your fuselage (2 x dorsal turrets, beam turret & nose turret) against the enemy, at the price of presenting a huge silhouette to it. This is a very dangerous tactic, but sometimes it is worth a try.\n\nOverall, this usage is more risky than maintaining altitude and bombing, but it could be rewarding if pulled off successfully.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n* [[Do 335 (Family)|Do 335]]: this interceptor posts a huge threat to the PB4Y due to its destructive firepower. An experienced Do 335 player might open fire from a far distance of 2.5 km away, at this range its MK108/MK103 shells still have adequate accuracy and damage to cripple the PB4Y, while the PB4Y's M2 Brownings can barely do any damage. The PB4Y's tail is also prone to being blown off by a few HE cannon shells.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Later in 1943, ROCAF got their hands on a few of those B-24Ds from 14th Air Force; although this would have to delay until 1944 where ROCAF finally has enough crew for the bombers, but this time B-24Ms.\n\nThese 37 B-24Ms then became part of the lend-lease program and strategic forces of ROCAF. During the upcoming Civil War in late 1940s and retreat of the Nationalist Forces to Taiwan, B-24s was the centerpiece of any bombing operation against PLA and the later Socialist China; due to the lack of replacement aircrafts from USAF and severe losses in Mainland China, these were soon phrased out by PB4Y-2s.\n\nThe arrival of PB4Y-2s were nowhere enough for any counter-attack operations to Mainland China with fleets of the latest jets and usually used for recon operations, including 34th “Black Bat” Squadron ''黑蝙蝠中隊'' ; while the Black Bats didn't lost any of them before changing for newer RB-57 and P-2V, there were records of shot downs over Mainland China from other squadrons (No. 012, during bombing operations; all crews KIA)<ref>http://www.mnd.gov.tw/NewUpload/201406/13-19.pdf</ref> and one was lost to Burmese Air Force in 1961 as it was carrying supplies to the Northern Burma Guerilla (緬北孤軍) of the Nationalist forces near Chinese borders. \n\nPB4Y-2 ended its frontline services in 1960 while some might have been transferred into transports, but very few records can prove so.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=pb4y-2_china Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/365067-consolidated-pb4y-2-privateer/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Consolidated}}\n{{China bombers}}"}}
