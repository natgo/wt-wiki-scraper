In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Hot Tracks\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe PBM-1 does not shine in flight performance as it has terrible climb rate and speed. This along with the low wing-loading makes it your average medium bomber without the perks of being able to outrun or out-climb your opponent.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,657 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* No armour\n* Self-sealing fuel tanks (4 in front fuselage, 1 in each wingroot)\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|AN-M30A1 (100 lb)|AN-M57 (250 lb)|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* 12 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs (1,200 lb total)\n* 6 x 250 lb AN-M57 bombs (1,500 lb total)\n* 6 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (3,000 lb total)\n* 2 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs + 4 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bombs (4,000 lb total)\n* 4 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bombs (4,000 lb total)\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|M2 Browning (12.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, nose turret (400 rpg)\n* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, dorsal turret (400 rpg)\n* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (375 rpg)\n* 1 x 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun, tail turret (350 rpg)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe PBM-1 should be played like its predecessors. Fly high and bomb bases. The PBM is however fairly slow and has a rather bad climb rate, so it will take time. The PBM can carry up to 4 x 1,000 lb bombs. It is advisable to carry this bombload for bombing bases. Even though you are slow, you are not defenceless. Your .50s will shred everything at your BR. Once your bombs are dropped it is advisable to land, but acting as a \"gunship\" can also be somewhat successful.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Quite manoeuvrable for a bomber (can outturn many heavy fighters, and some single-engine fighters)\n* Can carry a large payload for its BR (4,000 lbs)\n* If aimed properly, and using the right belts, defensive armament is very deadly\n* Defensive armament has great coverage\n* Using WEP doesn't make engines overheat\n* Large fuselage with lots of non-critical empty space can absorb lots of bullets \n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Gunners can easily be taken out, especially the tail gunner (no armour, and no bulletproof glass either)\n* Lacks a belly turret (due to being a boat) and therefore vulnerable to attacks directly from below\n* Very slow aircraft with a poor climb rate\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
