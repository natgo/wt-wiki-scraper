It was introduced during [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]] as part of the [[wt:en/news/6037-event-sea-voyage-en|Sea Voyage]] event that ran from 21 February to 11 March 2019.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nDue to the fact that it is a large seaplane, the PBM-3 is not very manoeuvrable and has trouble banking. However, when you get into a high-angle bank, it does turn fairly easily because of its large wings. As for payloads, it doesn't matter which payload you take for flight performance. All of the bombs are contained in the nacelle-mounted bomb bays and won't have a large difference in manoeuvrability.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,962 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nIn RB, the PBM-3 should be used as a traditional heavy bomber, as with the addition of naval mines, the PBM-3 is capable of ending the game on airfield map as long as its not an uptier.\n\nA single mine is able to destroy a normal base with 2 required for a double HP base, and it takes merely 5 mines to destroy a full HP airfield in a downtier. From the start of the game simply fly around the main fighting, bomb whatever bases still remain after potential allies destroy them, then bomb the airfield for an easy victory. In an uptier however it will take at least two runs to destroy an airfield, but you can still rack up plenty of lions and research by heavily damaging it.\n\nAgainst enemy aircraft that have seen and are heading towards you, you are generally better off turning to get as many guns on target as possible in order to have the best chance of a kill. Having access to the universal targets belt helps, as most aircraft in this tier have a weakness to fire.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In order to do so, the Navy started a competition between aircraft manufacturers, whose winner would receive a production contract with the Navy.\n\nThe Martin company submitted the designs on their four-engine Model 160 aircraft, which didn't garner any significant interest from the Navy. However, Martin continued to work on the design, reworking it into a two-engine aircraft, designated Model 162.\n\nThis design proved to be a lot more successful, with the Navy quickly ordering for a prototype of the aircraft to be produced. Designated XPBM-1 \"Mariner\", the prototype conducted its maiden flight in February 1939. Following successful trials, the aircraft was adopted by the USN as early as September 1939 and ordered into production.\n\nIn late 1940, Martin received a large order for more flying boats to be manufactured. However, with the company's production capacity being reached, construction of these new machines was delayed. In the meantime, the PBM was further improved by installing new engines, increasing overall size and doubling payload capacity. The new PBM-3 Mariner entered production in 1941, with the first batch of 32 vehicles entering service in 1942.\n\nThe Mariners primarily served with the USN as coastal patrol aircraft before the outbreak of WW2. However, after the United States' entry into WW2, Mariners were used in the anti-submarine role in the Atlantic and also took part in operations in the Pacific Theatre.\n\nThe PBM-3 Mariner flying boats of the third series served very briefly during WW2, as nearly all PBM-3s from the first series were converted into unarmed transport machines shortly after their construction. Nevertheless, the aircraft proved to be very successful and further models were built in large numbers - in total more than 1360 Mariner vehicles of different modifications. Mariners were also used in small numbers by Great Britain, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and the Netherlands. The last Mariners were phased out of service during the 1960s, being replaced by newer aircraft.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6040-development-pbm-3-mariner-the-eye-in-the-sky-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=pbm_3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:PBM-3 WTWallpaper 001.jpg\nFile:PBM-3 WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:PBM-3 WTWallpaper 003.jpg\nFile:PBM-3 WTWallpaper 004.jpg\nFile:PBM-3 WTWallpaper 005.jpg\nFile:PBM-3 WTWallpaper 006.jpg\nFile:PBM-3 WTWallpaper 007.jpg\nFile:PBM-3 WTWallpaper 008.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|NJAlhvjgrUs|'''{{PAGENAME}} - High bombload, Low Performance''' - ''Napalmratte''|UbkAs7sJp18|'''The {{PAGENAME}} In Game'''  - ''TheEuropeanCanadian''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[PBM-1 \"Mariner\"]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6040-development-pbm-3-mariner-the-eye-in-the-sky-en|[Devblog] PBM-3 Mariner: The Eye in the Sky]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/445723-pbm-3/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Martin_PBM_Mariner|[Wikipedia] Martin PBM Mariner]]\n* [http://airvectors.net/avmars.html#m3 <nowiki>[Air Vectors]</nowiki> The Martin Mariner, Mars, & Marlin Flying Boats - PBM-3 Mariner series]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Martin}}\n{{USA bombers}}\n{{USA premium aircraft}}"}}
