It also has a very good defensive armament for its tier, which can occasionally be a saviour against an enemy fighter.\n\nThe plane is quite unmanoeuvrable, and its wings are very weak, being able to snap just by turning just a little too tight at higher speeds in a Realistic Battle. Unlike its predecessor, this version has landing gear, allowing it to land on airfields as well as in water, allowing it to repair and respawn at airfields in Realistic Mode without belly landing, and enabling it to capture bases in Airfield Domination mode in Arcade Battles.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The main difference was the addition of amphibious capability; the wing pontoons were removed and hydraulically actuated, retractable tricycle landing gear were added to the fuselage. It did retain the ability to land on and take off from water. The PBY-5A was powered by two 1,200 horsepower R-1830-92 engines, for a total of 2,200 hp. The first production batch of 124 was equipped with only one .30 cal (7.62 mm) bow machine gun, while later batches had two.\n\n802 PBY-5A Catalinas were built in total between October 1941 and January 1945, with some being delivered to the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) and the Royal Air Force (RAF), and one to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The majority, though, were delivered to the United States Navy (USN). In USAAF service the PBY-5A was designated as the OA-10.\n\nDuring World War 2, PBY Catalinas were used heavily in the anti-submarine warfare (ASW), patrol bombing, convoy escort, search-and-rescue (SAR), and cargo transport roles.\n\nThe PBY was the most numerous aircraft to be used in the ASW role. They were used in ASW in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, and participated in a number of U-boat sinkings.\n\nBecause of the long range and endurance of the Catalina, it was used heavily in the maritime patrol role. Notably, the PBY Catalina was used to spot the Japanese fleet before the Battle of Midway.\n\nCatalinas were also used in the night combat role. During the Battle of Midway, PBYs scored a torpedo hit on the Japanese fleet oiler Akebono Maru. In the Guadalcanal campaign, Catalina were painted black in order to participate in night torpedo, bombing, and strafing missions against Japanese vessels. They came to be known as \"black cats\", and entire squadrons were dedicated to this purpose. These squadrons were used until being sent home in 1945.\n\nCatalina are probably most recognized for their search-and-rescue role. During the war they saved thousands of sailors and airmen, particularly after the sinking if the USS Indianapolis.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThere were two firms competing for the naval patrol bomber supply contract: Consolidated and Douglas. Although both prototypes met the U. S. Navy demands, on June 29, 1935 the contract was awarded to Consolidated due to lower production costs (the firm projected the cost of one aircraft to be $90,000, while their colleagues from Douglas quoted $110,000).\n\nManufacturing orders for PBY-2 and PBY-3 were concluded before the delivery of the first production aircraft from the previous series (accordingly, PBY-1 and PBY-2). However, when the order for PBY-4 was signed toward the end of 1937, which consisted of just 33 boat planes (this was the smallest of the PBY series), by the time production began the model was already considered outdated and likely to be the last of the series (when PBY-5 was commissioned, development of the next series of hydroplanes set to replace PBY was already underway).\n\nThat's exactly what would have happened if the Germans hadn't attacked Poland on September 1st, 1939, thus greatly increasing the demand for patrol aircraft.\n\nThe last three models in the PBY-4 series had a series of distinguishing features, many of which were kept and implemented in PBY-5. In 1939, the last PBY-4 built, BuNo 1245 was converted into an amphibian through the introduction of retractable undercarriage. The amphibian version of PBY-5 was redesignated PBY-5A, and looked promising enough to compel the U. S. Navy to modify their original order for 200 PBY-5 units so that 33 of those aircraft were executed as PBY-5A. This was followed by other supply agreements for additional 186 units of PBY-5A. Other countries followed suit, changing a portion of the ordered PBY-5 units to PBY-5A.\n\nThe PBY was used as a bomber and torpedo carrier, and was often utilized in night operations, as well as on patrol, rescue and transportation missions.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=pby-5a Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|60IVWW1_Flw|'''The Shooting Range #52''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:38 discusses the PBY-5 Catalina.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[PBM-1 \"Mariner\"]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/13677-pby-5-catalina-official-thread/& [Forum<nowiki>]</nowiki> PBY-5 Catalina, Official Thread]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Consolidated}}\n{{USA bombers}}"}}
