Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured. Describe the armour, if there is any, also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.-->\n\nThe Po-2 has a 13 mm steel plate in the nose, which is something but not useful as if you are attacked from the front you cannot retaliate. In Air RB, the Po-2's airframe is surprisingly reliable and is perfectly controllable even with serious damage, however, past a certain amount of damage (yellow all over and worse) you will not have enough power to keep airborne for much longer. At this point, you can make an emergency landing and act as an anti-aircraft gun for the rest of the match.\n\nIt also has a small, self-sealing fuel tank, as well as a tiny oil tank in from of it, both just behind the engine. This leads to a low chance of catching on fire, however, if you are set on fire you have very little chance of putting it out due to your slow speed.\n\n* 13 mm Steel plate in the nose.\n* Small, single, self-sealing fuel tank.\n\n== Armaments ==\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n<!--''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners.

The U-2 was designed as a primary civilian trainer and was forgiving and easy to fly. Its inaugural flight took place on 7th January 1928, with M. M. Gromov at the controls. As designed, the U-2 was a conventional biplane with an air-cooled 100-HP M-11 engine. The aircraft was widely used in agriculture, transport and other roles. Staff plane and ambulance variants also existed, as well as reconnaissance, passenger, floatplane and many other versions. \n\nBy 1932, a new military trainer variant, U-2VS was designed. It could carry six 8-kg dummy bombs on underwing pylons and had a gunner turret in the rear seat. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, many existing U-2s were converted to light night bombers. Modifications were made by both the Polikarpov Design Bureau, directly at the factories, and even in the field, by mechanics at front-line squadrons. As a result, the number of operational variants was high. The plane could carry from 100 to 350 kg of bombs. By 1943, the number of frontline Po-2 regiments reached its peak of up to 70 night bomber regiments. After Nikolay Polikarpov died in 1944, the aircraft was redesignated Po-2 in his memory. The aircraft remained in serial production until 1953, with over 33,000 built.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|nRGDD4N8UwM|'''Some of The RARE and HIDDEN Aircraft in War Thunder.''' - ''Ash'' ({{PAGENAME}} is displayed at 8:28)}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Po-2]] - The in-game playable version\n\n;Other race event vehicles\n* [[\"Racing\" M18]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/888/current|[Ugly Ducklings] Polikarpov U-2/Po-2]]\n* [[wikipedia:Polikarpov_Po-2|[Wikipedia] Polikarpov Po-2]]\n\n{{Sp-begin|Playable events}}\n<div align=\"left\">\n* [[wt:en/news/7397-event-halloween-in-war-thunder-en|Halloween 2021]]\n* [[wt:en/news/6920-event-halloween-in-war-thunder-en|Halloween 2020]]\n* [[wt:en/news/6460-event-halloween-in-war-thunder-en|Halloween 2019]]\n* [[wt:en/news/5856-event-halloween-in-war-thunder-en|Halloween 2018]]\n* [[wt:en/news/5062-special-halloween-update-winners-list-en|Halloween 2017]]\n* [[wt:en/news/4305-event-halloween-mischief-updated-01-11-2016-en|Halloween 2016]]\n* [[wt:en/news/3393--en|Halloween 2015]]\n* [[wt:en/news/2595/current|Halloween 2014]]\n* [[wt:en/news/321--en|Halloween 2013]]\n</div>\n{{Sp-end}}"}}
