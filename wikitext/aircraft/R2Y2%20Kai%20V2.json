It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].\n\nEven though the R2Y2s are able to equip 800 kg bombs, they wield a powerful set of 4 x 30 mm Type 5 cannons, mounted in the nose. This aircraft trio is similar to the Me 262 series as they all lack an engine or propeller in the front of the plane. Thus, the R2Y2 and its German counterpart wield an impressive set of cannons. However, unlike the legendary slow-firing, low muzzle velocity Mk-108s in the 262, the R2Y2 series wields Type 5 cannons with a much larger ammunition pool. Although their rates of fire are comparable, this fact of a higher ammunition count allows the R2Y2 to be able to destroy large amounts of aircraft without having to return to base. In arcade battles, having a large ammunition pool is also useful as it will often be unnecessary to reload.\n\nThe R2Y2 series of aircraft features a devastating battery of weapons mounted centrally within the nose. Much like the [[Me 262 (Family)|Me 262]], the lack of a piston engine mounted within the nose allows for much larger cannons to be placed within the space it would have occupied. 4 x 30 mm [[Type 5 navy (30 mm)|Type 5]] cannons with an ammo load of 600 rounds (150 rounds per gun) means the R2Y2 is effective at almost any role it is played as. Attacker or interceptor, the R2Y2 is an effective multi-role aircraft for the Japanese at rank V.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe R2Y2 is best utilized as a medium-altitude fighter in all game modes. Due to its lacklustre acceleration, gaining airspeed as early as possible is crucial. Once the R2Y2 pilot loses his or her speed, they are easy prey for fast-accelerating planes like the [[F7F-1|F7F]]. It is important to always have a high speed when attacking enemies as they will often be able to slot in on your tail in a matter of seconds. This short time can be a matter of life or death as many fast-turning propeller aircraft such as the Spitfire wield impressive armaments with high burst masses. However, these advantages can be nullified once the R2Y2 pilot has the ability to dive away at high speeds.\n\nIf tailed, it can often be difficult to evade enemies with this aircraft, jet engines or not. Many propeller planes like the [[Tempest Mk II|Tempest]] can easily stay with a diving R2Y2. If found in this situation, the R2Y2 pilot has a few choices. One, the best method is to call for teammate assistance. Not only can one keep the enemy greedy and focused on his or her tail, but this pilot can also \"set up\" that enemy for a teammate to destroy. If found alone, it can be possible to catch propeller planes in a \"speed trap\" where once the jet starts to outrun the enemy, pitch up to gain altitude. Once the enemy prop stalls out, dive on them. If the first pass doesn't result in a massive fuel fire and explosion, set up the same approach as before. Even if the propeller plane has the ability to outmanoeuvre the R2Y2, it is still very daunting to have to dodge an aircraft armed with four 30 mm cannons.\n\nThe R2Y2 can also be beneficial to any Japanese or arcade battles team as a ground attacker. It's 30 mm Type 5 cannons have the ability to equip armour-piercing rounds which are capable of destroying light tanks, medium tanks, and light pillboxes, among other targets. This coupled with the single 800 kg bomb can cause some serious damage.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Known as the Keiun or Keiun-Kai (\"Beautiful Cloud\" in Japanese) the aircraft would be a high-speed jet-bomber/attacker that could be used in the defence of the home islands of the Japanese empire. The powerplant of the jet Keiun-Kai would be a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines mounted in pods located, with one under each wing. Compared to the [[R2Y2 Kai V1|Version 1]], the V2 features the jet's air-intakes in the wing roots and the engine in the tail-beam similar to the [[F9F-5|F9F]]. The major advantage of this setup is the reduced air drag resulting in both better top speed and better acceleration. With the increased height less lawn and small stones can enter the jet engines, a common problem in WW2 as most military airports were plain lawn fields. However, the big disadvantage is increased maintenance time form the far more complicated engine arrangement. Further storage places for fuel get sparse. The last version [[R2Y2 Kai V3|V3]] would feature a nose-mounted air-intake with the engines remaining centrally mounted within the fuselage.\n\n[[File:FighterImage_R2Y2-Keiun-Kai-V2-2.jpg|thumbnail|right|The fuselage-mounted engine configuration of the V2]]\n\nThe Y-40 project began with failure of the Kugisho R1Y1 (Y-30) project for a fast, high-speed reconnaissance aircraft. The development of that project, along with inspiration from the German Heinkel He 119, the R2Y (Y-40) project was developed. Initially intended as a fast reconnaissance aircraft with a long-range that could be operated from land bases across the Japanese Empire, that would avoid interception with high-speed flight, however, Kugisho also informed the IJN that the aircraft could be adapted to other roles. They proposed that the planned Aichi Ha-70 engine powerplant of the R2Y1 could be replaced by a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines. Nonetheless, work on the R2Y1 continued, however, it proved troublesome due to the Aichi powerplant. Issues with the R2Y1 airframe, its powerplant and interference from American bombing prevented the development of the project past the piston-engined variant. By April 1945 the first prototype of the Keiun was ready for initial trials, with the first flight in early May of the same year. The R2Y1 suffered engine-cooling issues during its early development, and fire occurred during ground-testing that would damage the aircraft and its powerplant.\n\nThis would not be the only disaster of the project, as the first prototype was completely destroyed by a bombing raid, further damaging the R2Y's chances of ever becoming an operational aircraft. The second R2Y1 prototype was still under construction at the time of the Japanese surrender on August 15th and the R2Y2 remained on the drawing board.\n\n===V2 variant===\nThe R2Y2 V2 would feature a redesigned configuration that would also be proposed on in the [[R2Y2 Kai V3|V3]]. Rather than having the Ne-330 engines mounted in pods under the wings (as was the case with most contemporary jets at the time) the V2 featured the engines mounted within the fuselage and the wing roots featuring an air intake leading to them. As such, the profile of the aircraft changes significantly compared to the [[R2Y2 Kai V1|V1]]. This redesign of the R2Y1 was not chosen due to the extra cost per unit.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=japan&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=jet_fighter&vehicle=r2y2_v2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n[[File:FighterImage_Shot-2014.06.12-16.54.05.jpg|thumbnail|none|R2Y2 V2]]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/634|[Devblog] R2Y2 Keiun-Kai V1, V2, V3]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yokosuka}}\n{{Japan jet aircraft}}"}}
