In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 \"Advancing Storm\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThis Italian plane is best used as an energy fighter and can be a very good start to learn how to use Italian planes.\n\nThe plane climbs and dives very well, it can reach a high speed quickly, but like every Italian plane in this rank, controls will be stiff above 500 km/h (310 mph) IAS.\n\nThe best performance is between 400 to 500 km/h (248 to 310 mph) IAS, but in level flight the max speed is 450 km/h IAS.\n\nTo be in the above-mentioned speed range, climb up to 3,000 meters, and then dive onto the enemy. If the enemy is more than 2 km below, cut your throttle to 0% and only increase once at the same altitude as the enemy and started to losing speed. Diving or climbing straight at a 90-degree angle will cause the engine to shut down due to fuel cut-off.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,300 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Re.2000 Series 1 is an air superiority aircraft and can be used as an energy fighter or as a dogfighter. It has a good acceleration when using WEP but the engine in WEP overheats very quickly. Thanks to the structure of the aircraft, it can dive without problem at high speeds and retain that speed and momentum, making it excellent for boom and zoom fights. With its combat flaps, it can turn quickly, making it capable in a dogfight while you have your energy. The 12.7 mm SAFAT MGs are excellent against light and armoured enemy aircraft. Be aware though of the limited ammo for the 12.7 mm machine guns, only 300 rounds per gun. This means trigger discipline will be important. In the end it is a fighter capable of fighting in any situation without having too many downsides.\n\nOnce in game, climb up to 3,000 m and start gaining speed. If the enemy is at the same altitude, dodge any attempt at a head on, and try to out-turn/out-climb them.\n\nIf an enemy is below, dive down and attack. If you overshoot them, conduct a yo-yo manoeuvre to get back on their tail.\n\nSome enemies to be concerned about are:\n\n* Spitfires: The early versions carrying eight machine guns in their wings and will likely out turn you.\n* P-26s: Especially the version that carries a 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun.\n* Any Biplane: Most of these are very good turners. They can earn back speed after multiple turns very quickly, so in a dogfight, the Re.2000 might feel sluggish. Don't get baited into these turn fights and instead use the speed/climb to fly away towards an advantageous position to attack.\n\nWhen going against the Re.2000 serie 1, one will find head-ons effective against a Re.2000 since it only has two 12.7s machine guns. If you're in a head-on against one, shoot a small burst, and escape with a barrel roll.  If one is on your six, either run away at high speed or make some speed costly manoeuvres, and turn onto his six. Never try to follow one in a climb, and if one is diving on you, you can dodge it easily due to its control stiffening and average roll rate.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

The first test flight was flown by Mario de Bernardi in 1939. With a superior engine in comparison to the FIAT powered MC.200, it was thought to be at least as manoeuvrable as the Bf 109 E in comparative trials, though the positioning of the fuel tank in an unarmored wing centre section was found to be a fatal drawback and thus it was not accepted into Italian service, however, the Re.2000 was sold to both Sweden and Hungary to complement their air forces. During 1940, the Italian Navy ordered a modified version for carrier use with a Piaggio P.XI bis engine and structural strengthening for catapult launching and carrier landings.<ref>Thompson, Jonathan W., Italian Civil and Military Aircraft 1930-1945, Aero Publishers, Los Angeles (1963), 304 pages.</ref>\n\nHungary bought 70 Re.2000s and built another 192. Sweden bought 60, where they stayed in service until 1946. Britain had actually put in an order for 300, as well, before the onset of war prevented it. Those few of the 188 that were built by the Reggiane company that were not sold to other countries were used by an Italian squadron on Sicily in 1941/42, or converted for catapult use.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=re_2000_int Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|YygUVbVn_gA|'''(Arcade): {{PAGENAME}} - Simple but Sweet''' - ''tx141TX''|F79Ab3i4elE|'''Realistic: {{PAGENAME}} [Reggiane Bellissima!]'''  - ''Jengar''|dglE5EGyY0o|'''The Shooting Range #87''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:39 discusses the Re.2000.|6JgPdjV4ljc|'''Update 1.77 - {{PAGENAME}}'''  - ''TheEuropeanCanadian''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Re.2000 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5373-development-re-2000-the-italian-falcon-en|[Devblog] Re.2000: The Italian Falcon]]\n* [[wikipedia:Reggiane_Re.2000|[Wikipedia] Reggiane Re.2000]]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{AirManufacturer Reggiane}}\n{{Italy fighters}}"}}
