It was introduced during [[Update \"Hot Tracks\"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6981-special-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2020 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R.]] event.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Ro.57 is quite manoeuvrable for a strike aircraft, with a great roll rate and turn time, and will most likely be able to win turn fights with other twin-engine aircraft. However, remember, the Ro. 57 is not a turn fighter, and should not be used as such. In addition, it's rather slow for its BR, so keep that in mind when chasing enemies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAt the start of the battle, climb as high as you can. Use the air spawn to your advantage. Intercepting bombers is usually your main job as an interceptor. Head-on engagements are an option as you have good frontal armaments located in the nose. If you are engaged by a fighter, don't hesitate to turn fight. Your turn rate with combat flaps is much better than it may appear and is sometimes on par with even the Spitfire's turn rate under the right conditions. Boom and Zoom can be done but do so with extra caution as you will be chased quite easily by enemy fighters.\n\n'''CAS support'''\n\nThe Ro.57 Quadriarma is a champion in Close Air Support at its Battle Rating. With its cannons and payload, it is capable of completely turning around the fortunes of a lost game. The most effective loadout is the 2 x 160 kg bombs and 1 x 250 kg bomb, while as well as the tracer belt for the .50 cal and ground targets belt for the cannons. The launching device of the central bomb is similar to that of the Ju-87 Stuka, so consider having to stay in a dive for about 2 or 3 seconds before the central bomb is released from the mini catapult, in this situation you can extend the airbrake in order to slow down further and be more accurate with the bombs. For the bombs on the wings there are no problems, those are released immediately.\n\n'''Air Superiority'''\n\nIn addition to being a good CAS, the Quadriarma can play a very important role in air superiority, in this case do not equip bombs, or make sure you have dropped them before you devote yourself to air superiority. In this area it is recommended to arm the Ro.57 with tracer bullets for the 12.7 mm and the Universal belt for the 20 mm. The Quadriarma strongly suits the energy fighter style of play, even if it doesn't look like it, once enough energy and the right position are acquired, it turns into an excellent fighter.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It had 2 powerful Fiat A.74 R.C.38 engines with 840 HP each and the plane had a maximum speed of 501 km/h at 5,250 metres of altitude.\n\nAfter 2 years, during 1941, after the failure of [[Breda 88 (P.XI)|Breda Ba.88]] as an attacker, the Regia Aeronautica decided to return to the Ro.57 project and make it a complete attacker. 2 variants were created.\n\n[[File:Ro.57 Quadriarma during tests.png|thumb|Ro.57 Quadriarma during tests]]\nIn addition to the ventral attachment for a 500 kg bomb, two wing pylons were added for bombs up to 250 kg, a ventral window (necessary for targeting), and aerodynamic dive brakes.\n\nThe plane got new armament with the addition of two [[Hispano 404 (20 mm)|20 mm Hispano 404]] plus the two [[Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT]] already in the previous tests and prototypes.\n\nThis variant is obscure because the Hispano 404 cannons were only used briefly for testing.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the aircraft was renamed IMAM Ro.57 Bis. The aerodynamic obstruction of the rafters, the ventral window, the aerodynamic brakes and the tailwheel brought the maximum speed down to 480 km/h. Worse still, due to strange aerodynamic interference, the oil cooler of the right engine provided insufficient cooling, causing a tendency for the engine to overheat at maximum revs, and the aircraft was unstable when diving, thus compromising the accuracy of the dive bombing.\n\n[[File:Ro.57 Quadriarma during training.png|thumb|Ro.57 during training]]\nIn spite of these defects, the Regia Aeronautica's shortcomings in the field of assault aircraft led, at the end of 1942, to an order for 200 units of the Ro.57 Bis, later reduced to 110. Of these, according to the registration numbers, 75 were built before September 8, 1943, and between 50 and 60 were actually delivered to the Regia Aeronautica (which assigned them to the 97º Gruppo Tuffatori, 226ª and 227ª squadriglia). The aircraft had no importance in the war, as the pilots were not able to finish their training on the new machines before most of the aircraft were destroyed on the ground on July 13, 1943 due to a bombing raid conducted by B-24s on the airfield of Crotone Isola Rizzuto (now Crotone Airport), intended to annihilate the Reggiane Re.2002 of the 5°Stormo and Fiat G.50 of the 50°Stormo that had repeatedly hit the Allied ships engaged in the landing in Sicily.\n\nThe subsequent prototype of the IMAM Ro.58 two-seater heavy fighter was derived from the design of the IMAM Ro.57.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6998-development-ro-57-quadriarma-en|Devblog]] ===\nJust before the outbreak of World War II, the Italian Regia Aeronautica placed an order for a heavy fighter for escorting bombers and long air patrols. The IMAM-based design group proposed a twin-engined aircraft with a pair of FIAT A.74RC.38 engines, armed with two heavy machine guns. Soon the aircraft was modified - the armament was reinforced with two 20mm cannons, an air brake was installed, and bomb armament added.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=italy&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=assault&vehicle=ro_57_quadriarma Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Ro.57 Quadriarma Devblog Images\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Ro.57 WTWallpaper 001.jpg|\nFile:Ro.57 WTWallpaper 002.jpg|\nFile:Ro.57 WTWallpaper 003.jpg|\nFile:Ro.57 WTWallpaper 004.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|0d_OIZP_r50|'''Starting Christmas in Style!
