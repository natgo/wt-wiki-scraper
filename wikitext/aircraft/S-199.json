It also lacks manoeuvrability and has a poor climb rate. In Realistic Battles, the fighter should be used as a support role. The S-199 is effective at boom-and-zooming and is able to knock out an enemy aircraft quickly with a few bursts.\n\nFirst, you level out on the runway after taking off and hit 300 km/h IAS, then you climb to the side opposite to the one facing the enemy airfield and lower your climb angle once you hit 250-270 km/h IAS. Continue climbing until you reach 4,500 m, despite the stats, the S-199 has a pretty average climb and if you utilise your climb speed well, you can find yourself at comparable altitude. It's a good option to let your teammates engage first, and drive the enemy to a lower altitude than you, after that you can Boom-n-Zoom them.\n\nThe S-199 gets one decent turn before it loses its energy, that one turn is useful against Yak-9, La-5, and MiG-3s. If you miss this shot, dive to get a little speed before thinking about manoeuvring, a good defensive move will be to cut throttle to 50% and roll out of the guns of the plane chasing you, if you keep your wing perpendicular to the enemies you should be ok for a while, force an overshoot, then either spiral away to the opposite side and run to a teammate, or if you have enough speed, you can try to go for the shot. It may be a little tough to fly, but with the correct attitude and spirit, it can do wonders. Remember: superior tactics can beat superior machinery, applying a bit of forward thinking can save you your repair costs, and it's always best to fly with a teammate, maybe even a fellow S-199.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Unfortunately for the IAF, there were strict arms embargoes put in place on Israel which made it challenging. The IAF's purchasing agents then set out and  approached aircraft manufacturers across Europe to find one who might be able to provide fighters.\n\nThe Czech manufacturer Avia had been building Messerschmitt Bf 109s for the Germans during WW2, and continued to do so even after the war. Initially in the postwar era, Avia produced the [[Bf 109 G-10]] with the DB 605 engine, a variant they designated the S-99. When the limited stocks of DB 605s ran out after only 21 S-99s constructed, subsequent Bf 109 G airframes were modified to use the Junkers Jumo 211F engines.\n\nThe Bf 109 + Jumo 211F combination proved less than successful: the engine and propeller were designed for heavy bomber aircraft like the Heinkel [[He 111 (Family)|He 111]] which required torque, not light fighter aircraft like the Bf 109 which require speed. The early-war designed Jumo 211F also had nearly half the performance of the mid-war designed DB 605. Due to the design of the engine itself, the Jumo 211F could not be fitted with an internal cannon running through the propeller hub like the DB 605, so the S-199s were equipped with solid nose cones. The cannon armament was relocated to the wings using Rüstsatz gunpod kits. These changes produced a fighter which was slow, had poor manoeuvrability, was difficult to control, and was seriously overweight for its engine output. Nevertheless, Avia made 559 S-199 fighters, predominately for the Czechoslovak Air Force.\n[[File:S-199 vs C-47, Tel Aviv.jpg|alt=IAF pilot Modi Alon chasing an Egyptian C-47 over Tel Aviv, June 3, 1948|thumb|200px|Alon chasing an Egyptian C-47 over Tel Aviv, 1948]]\nIn 1947, Israel negotiated the purchase of twenty-five Avia S-199s, which arrived at the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It was here that many S-199 pilots encountered reliability and combat issues with the aircraft which limited their effectiveness. One of these issues stemmed from the fact that the Jumo 211F was not designed to be used with a gun synchronizer, a mechanical component which prevents an aircraft's guns from firing while the propeller is in the firing line. Therefore, new ones had to be procured and the one which were fitted proved to be unreliable. It was not uncommon for Israeli pilots to inadvertently shoot off their own propellers when the gun synchronizer failed.\n\nThe S-199s did find several major victories, however. On June 3, 1948 an S-199 piloted by Modi Alon of 101 Squadron, Israel's first fighter squadron, attacked a formation of two Egyptian C-47 Skytrains and two Spitfires which had repeatedly bombed the city of Tel Aviv. Alon managed to shoot down both C-47s, marking the first air-to-air kills of the Israeli Air Force. The action was witnessed by the public below, who met the IAF and Alon with great enthusiasm and joy. On June 8th, Israelis were able to prove themselves capable in the S-199 again when IAF pilot Gideon Lichtaman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire in the defense of Tel Aviv, scoring Israel's first fighter-vs-fighter victory.\n\nThe S-199, despite its poor mechanical performance, gained the distinction of being the first fighter aircraft procured by Israel and provided valuable combat experience and victories for the fledgeling IAF pilots.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=s_199 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Szjj7F1iHL4|'''The Shooting Range #291''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:52 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|0uI33fRlznc|'''The Shooting Range #288''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:29 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Bf 109 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7457-development-avia-s-199-a-knife-for-israel-en|[Devblog] Avia S-199: A \"knife\" for Israel]]\n\n{{Israel fighters}}\n{{AirManufacturer Avia}}"}}
