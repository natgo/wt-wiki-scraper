If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nWith a significantly higher Battle Rating than the previous two Sparviero models, the 1941 Sparviero features the same bomb load-outs (but can also carry a single torpedo) and armament, with only relatively minor increases in performance. While unable to compete with the Ju 88 or the He 111 H-6 and Fw 200 C-1 Condor in terms of performance or sheer bomb-carrying capacity, respectively, the SM.79 (1941) can still perform decently if played carefully.\n\nIt is very important to avoid fighters in the SM.79, as it has a lot of defensive fire dead-zones and is not as durable as the Ju 88. If an enemy fighter is foolish enough to stay within the reach of the 12.7 mm Breda-SAFATs, they can deal a considerable amount of damage to the pursuer. However, the gunners themselves have no armour protection and can be knocked out fairly easily.\n\nDue to the relatively light payload carried by the SM.79, it is not particularly recommended to go base bombing, even with the max load of 5 x 250 kg bombs. It is better to dive towards ground level and destroy targets like tanks or vehicles, as this will make it harder for enemies to attack you from below, where the Sparviero has very limited defensive fire coverage. The 500 kg bombs reduce your total bombload to only 1000 kg, but they are more forgiving of poor bomb aiming and can take out pillboxes with a single hit. Be wary of attacks from the sides, as only the weak 7.7 mm machine guns cover the flanks of the Sparviero.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The more advanced CANT Z.1007 \"Alcione\", also a three-engined plane, was replacing the ageing SM.79. However, the \"Sparviero\" soon had another, just as important role as the primary \"workhorse\" of Italian naval aviation.\n\nIn March 1937, one of the SM.79s was equipped with a special torpedo sight, and under the fuselage a left-offset suspension rack was installed for an 860kg 450-mm torpedo. In November 1937, the plane passed all flight tests. In March 1938, a new version which carried two torpedoes was tested. This time, results were not so good, since the weight hindered the plane's controllability. Consequently, the variant accepted was the one-torpedo version. Beginning in late 1939, all SM.79 production aircraft were fitted with torpedo mounts.\n\nThe SM.79 torpedo bombers had virtually the same design as the regular bombers. Their crew was increased by one person: a naval observation officer, who sat between radio operator and mechanic. From 1941 on, the engines were equipped first with extended tailpipes, and then with Wellington flame arresters. Arresters were also installed on the barrels of the machine guns.\n\nIn 1942, the Alfa-Romeo 126RC34 engines were equipped with an ethanol injection system, which allowed a short engine output boost to 900 hp, increasing the plane's speed by 50 km/h. But this reduced the engine's life span, which was already unsatisfactory.\n\nOn July 25, 1940, the first experimental torpedo squadron, containing five aircraft, was founded. It was an SM.79 from this group that launched the first torpedo attack on the ships in the Egyptian port of Alexandria on August 15, 1940.\n\nBy early 1942, the Italian torpedo bombers had become a major force to be reckoned with. By November 1942 there were 147 SM.79 torpedo bombers in service, in nine groups.\n\nIn June and August 1942, the Italians persistently attacked British convoys breaking through to Malta with moderate success, but they themselves lost about 50 SM.79s, with experienced crews.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/428091-sm79-sparviero-as-1941/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer SM}}\n{{Germany bombers}}\n[[Category:Hidden vehicles]]"}}
