In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.277 in the German aviation tree. In [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]], the S.M.79, as well as the other Italian planes in the German tree, were moved to the new Italian tree. This variant is painted in Romanian markings.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Alessandro Marchetti argued that twin-engine planes, not three-engine, would be best for export. So, in spite of the Royal Italian Air Force's rejection of the SM.79B bomber project, he continued work in this area, developing a prototype.\n\nThe SM.79B had a completely redesigned nose section. A glazed cabin for the bombardier/navigator was placed where the centrally located engine used to be. The cockpit, to improve visibility, was moved forward and raised. The dorsal \"hump\" was moved farther back. Also, the area of the keel was increased slightly.\n\nThe plane was powered by two 14-cylinder star-shaped air-cooled Gnome-Rhone 14Kfs engines with 950 hp and a metal three-bladed variable-pitch SIAI propeller.\n\nThe engines were placed in elongated engine nacelles, and the aeroplane was given a more streamlined design, which fully compensated for the reduction in total thrust. The aircraft's defensive armament remained virtually unchanged: three heavy-calibre 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine guns, with 500 rounds per gun. One fixed machine gun was placed in the nose, and a second was located in the turret under the hump's sliding panel. The ventral gondola was now used only for a third gun, defending the plane from attacks from the lower rear.\n\nThe twin-engine SM.79B was offered to Belgium, Brazil, China, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union. However, no orders from any of these countries were ever received.\n\nIn the spring of 1937, Iraq ordered five SM.79Bs. The aircraft for Iraq were equipped with A.80 RC.41 engined with a takeoff power of 1030 hp. The third, fourth, and fifth SM.79Bs had larger cockpit windows. In early 1938, the Italian crews ferried the aircraft to the customer. All of these planes were eventually destroyed in 1941 during the rebellion in Iraq.\n\nThe largest order for the twin-engine SM.79B was placed by the country of Romania. In autumn of 1937, the Romanians requested 24 of the aircraft equipped with IAR K14-II engines with a power of 900 hp. (A licensed version of the Gnome-Rhone engine, produced in Romania.)\n\nWhen compared with the Iraqi planes, the Romanian version had several differences: the mobile 7.92mm Browning FN machine gun with rotary magazine and 350 rounds of ammunition (mounted in the nose) and various equipment modifications. In 1938, these aircraft entered service with two squadrons of the Forţele Aeriene Regale ale Romaniei (Royal Romanian Air Force).\n\n=== In-game description ===\nTwin-engine SIAI Savoia-Marchetti SM.79B medium bomber.\n\nDuring the pre-war period, SIAI actively tried to export the SM.79.
