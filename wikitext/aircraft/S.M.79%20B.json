Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThe plane has no armour and the pilot has no protection at all, making the pilot easily to knock out in head-on attacks. The fuel tanks are self-sealing and they are located close to the central airframe so you can take some shots on the wings and won't get on fire. There is no frontal gunner, leaving the bomber exposed to frontal attacks.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIt is a bomber with a decent climb rate for the BR, allowing you to easily get above fighters. In most scenarios, you will eventually be intercepted at the end of the battle. Try outrunning climbing enemy fighters at high altitude, since most fighters at the BR will see their performance drastically reduced at high altitude. If you face a interceptor like the MiG-3 or the P-38, it is better to turn back to base or seek allied cover.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Most surprising the wings are completely wood! A major technical achievement for its size.  During its production life several engines where tried, depending on power and reliability, one model even removing the nose engine.\n\nTo make the SM.79 fast the wings are shorter than typical for its weight.  To compensate for higher clean stall speed a number of advanced high lift devices were used to reduce stall speed for landing, being Handley-Page leading extending slats and drooping ailerons (also called “flaperons”) in conjunction with uncommon slotted flaps.  After trying a few engines, the Alfa Romeo 126 was used on the prototypes for testing and the record breaking flights soon after.  As with the SM.73 / S.81, once again the Italian military wanted a bomber version and laid out proposed additions.\n\n''Sparviero goes to war''\n\nThe spacious cabin was easy to install a set of bomb racks, all bombs mounted vertically (not unusual for time).  While the S.81 had the bomb aimers position just behind the nose mounted engine, the SM.79 positioned it in a ventral “tub” well after of the bomb bay itself.  Also unlike the S.81 this streamlined tub also became the location of the ventral defensive gun, usually a 12.7mm Breda-SAFT MG instead of a turret.  A streamlined dorsal mount was also installed for a rear firing 12.7mm MG, and unusually for bombers a fixed, pilot fired forward mounted 12.7mm MG, firing above the propeller disk.  Both these streamlined protrusions could be closed to greatly minimize drag for a very high cruise speed, which the turreted S.81 could not.  It was the prominent hump on its top that earned the nickname il gobbo maledetto (\"damned hunchback\").  Italy was open to export sales, and many countries purchased this top of line bomber to add to their forces.\n\nFrom the high of the Spanish Civil War to the end of WW2, the Sparviero was the backbone of Italian bomber air forces and continued to do well over the vast stretches of the Mediterranean sea despite better allied defenses.  Success was made despite high losses up to the Italian Armistice.  They continued to be used in lesser roles on both sides of the conflict, and after the war were used for various duties by several nations for years later.  Lebanon was the last operator who used them well in the 1950’s and are the last 2 remaining SM.79 in world.\n\nRomania wanted a 2 engine Gnome-Rhone version, which S.M. provided.  The entire forward cockpit was rearranged, pilots in tandem, and a large glass nose for the bombardier, the original ventral location replaced with a streamlined front.  The weight savings from one less engine and all its wires, tubes controls, and extra fuel tank offset most of the performance loss of one engine, however it was more vulnerable to damage and engine issues.  Unsatisfied with the poor performing Gnome-Rhone engines, Romania had a number built with the Jumo 211 engine.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/428092-sm79b-romania/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer SM}}\n{{Italy bombers}}"}}
