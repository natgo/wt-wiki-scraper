In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]], though a variant existed in the Germany aircraft tech tree prior to the update.\n\nDue to its relatively low Battle Rating, the three-engined SM.79 serie 1 enjoys a relatively high speed for a bomber against most of the lower tiered opposition it faces. This aids its survivability, particularly in a shallow dive. Unfortunately, it is rather lacking in bombload options compared to the He 111s and Ju 88s and also has rather poor defensive fire arcs.\n\nUnlike the German bombers, however, it is armed with 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns which can pack quite a punch against the flimsier aircraft it faces. The pilot also controls a fixed forward-firing 12.7 mm Breda, which is otherwise uncovered by any defensive armament. This gun can be useful for strafing light vehicles and trucks that will be encountered frequently in low tier battles and can be used to shoot down other aircraft. It is somewhat more manoeuvrable than the He 111 H-3, but the Sparviero is by no means a fighter and will rapidly lose energy in turns. With the ability to carry 500 kg bombs, the SM.79 can use these to more easily take out pillboxes and heavier tanks, although this reduces the total bombload to only 1000 kg as opposed to 1250 kg with 250 kg bombs.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nS.M.79 serie 1 is a decent bomber at its BR and below, but it faces many threats, for example [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]], [[LaGG-3 (Family)|LaGG-3s]], [[MiG-3 (Family)|MiG-3s]] and [[P-40 (Family)|P-40s]].\n\nIf the S.M.79 manage to get past the threats, it jas the payload to take out enemy bomb points and ground targets, with its bomber spawn it can descend to get extra speed to quickly get to the bombing point, those this will also expose it to enemy fighters and attackers that have the firepower to destroy the S.M.79 with ease in both Realistic and Arcade battles.\n\nA big drawback with the S.M.79 is that it's big and not fast or agile compared to certain bombers at same BR but if it is able to pass through enemy line it can cause a lot of damage to the points. It has 2 x 12.7 mm Breda MGs aiming backwards in a limited field of view making a lot of the plane uncovered by the MGs, as well as 2 x 7.7 mm Breda MGs on the sides, also with limited views, leaving a lot of the plane unprotected.\n\nS.M.79 also has an offensive 12.7 mm which can do damage to enemy fighters or bombers, if one has a well trained aim, it can be a dangerous weapon to the S.M.79's advantage. The problem with the 12.7 mm is its slow RoF compared to other 12.7 mm and a low count of 350 rounds in the gun.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Most surprising the wings are completely wood! A major technical achievement for its size.  During its production life several engines where tried, depending on power and reliability, one model even removing the nose engine. ''\n\n''To make the SM.79 fast the wings are shorter than typical for its weight.  To compensate for higher clean stall speed a number of advanced high lift devices were used to reduce stall speed for landing, being Handley-Page leading extending slats and drooping ailerons (also called “flaperons”) in conjunction with uncommon slotted flaps.  After trying a few engines, the Alfa Romeo 126 was used on the prototypes for testing and the record breaking flights soon after.  As with the SM.73 / S.81, once again the Italian military wanted a bomber version and laid out proposed additions.''\n\n''Sparviero goes to war''\n\n''The spacious cabin was easy to install a set of bomb racks, all bombs mounted vertically (not unusual for time).  While the S.81 had the bomb aimers position just behind the nose mounted engine, the SM.79 positioned it in a ventral “tub” well after of the bomb bay itself.  Also unlike the S.81 this streamlined tub also became the location of the ventral defensive gun, usually a 12.7mm Breda-SAFT MG instead of a turret.  A streamlined dorsal mount was also installed for a rear firing 12.7mm MG, and unusually for bombers a fixed, pilot fired forward mounted 12.7mm MG, firing above the propeller disk.  Both these streamlined protrusions could be closed to greatly minimize drag for a very high cruise speed, which the turreted S.81 could not.  It was the prominent hump on its top that earned the nickname il gobbo maledetto (\"damned hunchback\").  Italy was open to export sales, and many countries purchased this top of line bomber to add to their forces.''\n\n''From the high of the Spanish Civil War to the end of WW2, the Sparviero was the backbone of Italian bomber air forces and continued to do well over the vast stretches of the Mediterranean sea despite better allied defenses.  Success was made despite high losses up to the Italian Armistice.  They continued to be used in lesser roles on both sides of the conflict, and after the war were used for various duties by several nations for years later.  Lebanon was the last operator who used them well in the 1950’s and are the last 2 remaining SM.79 in world.''\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/87331-savoia-marchetti-sm79-1936/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer SM}}\n{{Italy bombers}}"}}
