It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]], though a [[S.M.79_serie_8_(Germany)|variant]] existed in the [[:Category:Germany_aircraft|German aircraft tech tree]] prior to the update. The only readily apparent difference between the serie 8 and the [[S.M.79 serie 1]] is the ability to activate WEP, as well as an improved dorsal turret allowing for a slightly higher vertical firing arc.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe S.M.79 serie 8 is an interesting aircraft to fly - it has a decent amount of survivability and defensive armament, but carries less bombs than its peers.\n\n'''Air battles:'''\n\nIn air battles, the S.M.79 should be used as a traditional base bomber - it is decent at this role, being able to take out at least one base using its bomb load. At the start of the map, run straight for the bases. There is no need to climb, as most fighters at this BR will struggle to climb to the S.M.79's altitude. When arriving at the base, switch to the bomb sight and drop your bomb load - the 250 kg bombs are the most effective against bases, as three will be enough for a base. The 500 kg bombs cannot always kill a base in one shot, meaning that the 250 kg bombs are usually the better option. Once you've dropped your load, head back to base and grab some more; the S.M.79 is very ineffective without its payload.\n\nIn the case that you are being pursued by an enemy fighter, do not fear! The S.M.79 has a decent defensive armament for its BR. You have access to two 12.7 mm Breda machine guns, one dorsal and one ventral, as well as two beam-mounted 7.7 mm Lewis guns. The 12.7 mm guns are quite effective and can easily take out an engine or pilot-snipe. Thus, when being pursued, bait the enemy onto your six, and fire at them with the Breda guns. Don't attempt to outmanoeuvre any fighters - it will never happen, given the S.M.79's poor manoeuvrability. As well, the S.M.79 is quite fast for a bomber and can even outrun some fighters! When being shot at, diving away is another great option.\n\n'''Ground battles:'''\n\nThe S.M.79 is a great early ground-pounder for ground battles, being equipped with a large amount of bombs. In this playstyle, the GP 500 bombs are by far the most effective, as they pack a large amount of explosives and can easily take out a cluster of tanks at a choke point - a capture point, for example. When attacking, approach low (don't forget to set a bomb fuse delay), drop, and pull out. As well, beware of any enemy SPAAs as they can tear the S.M.79's fuselage apart - thus, staying low when flying back to base is a good option, as it keeps the S.M.79 out of the range of enemy SPAAs. Against enemy fighters, use the tactics listed above - the S.M.79 is quite effective at its BR in terms of defensive armament.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In 1922 Marchettí joined Savoia to form one of the great aircraft companies in history, until merged in 1983. After the conclusion of the Schneider Trophy race (won by UK), the firm used its experience to build fast aircraft for civilian and military use.\n\nYou probably saw the very similar looking Italian SM.81 in game, which was a militarized version of the successful S.73. The SM.79 was new passenger version based on the planform of its predecessor; the most obvious difference was retractable landing gear. It was truly made first as a passenger version to compete with those being made by other countries. Needless to say, it immediately attracted attention of the Regina Italia and a bomber version was developed in parallel. For a few brief months it was considered the best transport and bomber in world and became a major point of pride in Fascist Italy and was sold to several countries in the years before WW2.\n\nUnlike nearly every bomber in War Thunder (and even in WW2), it was built mainly of steel a wood! The fuselage was a common for time welded steel tube design, with entire rear half being covered in cloth and plywood. The crew area to nose was duralumin-clad (which is very similar to Hawker Hurricane's construction). Most surprising the wings are completely wood! A major technical achievement for its size. During its production life several engines where tried, depending on power and reliability, one model even removing the nose engine.\n\nTo make the SM.79 fast the wings are shorter than typical for its weight. To compensate for higher clean stall speed a number of advanced high lift devices were used to reduce stall speed for landing, being Handley-Page leading extending slats and drooping ailerons (also called \"flaperons\") in conjunction with uncommon slotted flaps. After trying a few engines, the Alfa Romeo 126 was used on the prototypes for testing and the record breaking flights soon after. As with the SM.73/S.81, once again the Italian military wanted a bomber version and laid out proposed additions.\n\n'''Sparviero goes to war'''\n\nThe spacious cabin was easy to install a set of bomb racks, all bombs mounted vertically (not unusual for time). While the S.81 had the bomb aimers position just behind the nose mounted engine, the SM.79 positioned it in a ventral \"tub\" well after of the bomb bay itself. Also unlike the S.81 this streamlined tub also became the location of the ventral defensive gun, usually a 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT MG instead of a turret. A streamlined dorsal mount was also installed for a rear firing 12.7 mm MG, and unusually for bombers a fixed, pilot fired forward mounted 12.7 mm MG, firing above the propeller disk. Both these streamlined protrusions could be closed to greatly minimize drag for a very high cruise speed, which the turreted S.81 could not. It was the prominent hump on its top that earned the nickname il gobbo maledetto (\"damned hunchback\"). Italy was open to export sales, and many countries purchased this top of line bomber to add to their forces.\n\nFrom the high of the Spanish Civil War to the end of WW2, the Sparviero was the backbone of Italian bomber air forces and continued to do well over the vast stretches of the Mediterranean sea despite better allied defences. Success was made despite high losses up to the Italian Armistice. They continued to be used in lesser roles on both sides of the conflict, and after the war were used for various duties by several nations for years later. Lebanon was the last operator who used them well into the 1950s and are the last 2 remaining SM.79 in world.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sm_79_1939_italy Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n* {{Specs-Link|sm_79_1939}} - Exact same variant of aircraft in the German tech tree\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/428095-sm79-sparviero-serie-8-1939/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer SM}}\n{{Italy bombers}}"}}
