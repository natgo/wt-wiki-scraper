In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} French fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5008-news-french-aircraft-in-update-1-73-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.73 \"Vive la France\"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/6170-special-victory-day-en|2019 Victory Day Sale]], but was later reintroduced for the [[wt:en/news/6694-shop-may-sale-in-war-thunder-en|2020 May Sale]] purchasable in-game for Golden Eagles {{ge}}.\n\nThe Narval (French for Narwhal) is designed to be an interceptor and it excels in this role with a good climb rate, interceptor spawn, high speed and 6 powerful cannons.\n\nUnderneath the sleek and eye-pleasing design of the Narval lies a monster of a plane when piloted well. It wields an extremely powerful sextet of the previously mentioned cannons, which happen to be the German MG 151s, wielding the dreaded Minengeschoß ammunition round which gives ballistics similar to most 37 mm cannons while keeping the various upsides of 20 mm cannons (light weight, high muzzle velocity and universal use) allowing you to shred bombers in a few well aimed bursts.\n\nHowever, the plane is not without its weaknesses. The rear mounted engine and propeller makes it easy for the engine to get knocked out when being tailed. It also has a particularly poor turn rate, so turning versus most planes is a death sentence, as it will make it easy for an opponent to snipe your pilot.\n\nHaving 6 cannons means that you are completely defenceless after running out of ammo in them, with no extra machine guns to defend yourself with (though with 250 rounds per cannon and 6 cannons, you shouldn't run out of ammo easily).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

The first thing you will notice is the interestingly designed pair of wings. The inboard leading edge of its wing was sweptback 24 degrees, while the outboard section was sweptback 13.5 degrees and incorporated a dihedral angle. The superb roll rate was achieved with a combination of small ailerons at the tip of the wings and spoilers along with clipped wings which only slightly reduced the plane's turning capability. It also wears large double slotted flaps designed to decrease speed for carrier operations.\n\nThe powerful Arsenal 12H (which was a copy of the Junkers Jumo 213) allows the plane to get to a very high top speed at around 8,000 meters and gives it brutal speed in a dive.\n\nThe plane is also made entirely out of metal, which allows it to take some punishment from enemy fighters.\n\nThe Narval is an exceptional interceptor, however due to its ability to mount either 2 x 1,000 lb bombs or 8 x T10 151 AP rockets, it can also make an effective strike fighter.\n\nIf going the interceptor route, you must climb to a high altitude in order to not only attack bombers, but make the most out of the 12H, where it performs the best.\n\nOn the flip side, if you are going for the strike fighter role, be aware that mounting rockets and bombs will throw the centre of gravity back, which worsens the already bad turn rate.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was to be powered by an Arsenal 12H02 V-12 which was a French postwar development of the Junkers Jumo 213 that famously powered the FW 190D series. The 12H would make a max 2,250 Hp that would power contra-rotating pusher propellors and could propel the Narval to 730 km/h (454 mp/h) at 8,000 meters. The Narval also would've been armed with 6 x 20 mm cannons mounted vertically on the cheeks, with 3 on each cheek and hard points that could mount 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of ordnance were placed under the wings. Because the 12H02 was tuned for high altitudes and had a turbo-supercharger, it likely would've been used as a High Altitude Bomber Interceptor, but due to the hard points, it could've also been used as a Strike Fighter, which gives it a similar role to the famed Republic P-47 Thunderbolt; a Strike Fighter/Interceptor.\n\nHowever, only two prototypes were created, and the development of the Narval was abandoned by 1950 since the design was already obsolescent due to the advancements in jet engine technology. Even if SNASCO had continued development for the Narval, it is likely that it wouldn't have been accepted due to the cost of producing the plane, the massive weight (7 tonnes!) and the unorthodox design.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=so_8000_narval Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|zn2uhgI2PPg|'''Best twin-boom aircraft''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 00:42 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|d5k2T9FP0bQ|'''Avoid them in frontal attack!''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:00 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|GUuwhehlL-U|'''Premium Vehicles: S.O.8000 Narval''' - ''War Thunder Wiki''|eqLe-I0FRwQ|'''The Shooting Range #72''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:28 discusses the S.O.8000 Narval.|WSqlxUQsl50|'''The Shooting Range #66''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 10:23 discusses the S.O.8000 Narval.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/385703-so-8000-narval/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer SNCA SO}}\n{{France fighters}}\n{{France premium aircraft}}"}}
