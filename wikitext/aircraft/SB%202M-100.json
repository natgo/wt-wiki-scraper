At its low battle rating, it is capable of outrunning some of the fighters it encounters, such as the F3F and I-153 Chaika. With enough energy though, it can outrun early monoplanes such as the Ki-27, the F2A (rare), and even a P-36.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

The fuel tanks are not protected but they are self-sealing. The gunners are all exposed with the exception of the nose gunner. The dorsal gunner has his torso sticking out of the plane. As a result, if trailed, pull some small evasive manoeuvres making it harder to disable the gunners.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Arcade Battles:'''\n\nThis bomber is quite fast for its BR so you should use this as an advantage. For example, climb directly at the beginning of the match to 5,000 m and destroy the enemy bases with the 500 kg bomb, which is the heaviest payload you'll have with this plane. Note that a good reload speed can make it easier to take out all the bases more quickly. A more aggressive playstyle is available for this plane. You can destroy small yet valuable ground targets with the 6x 100 kg bombs. This is however a much more risky playstyle for the SB 2M.\n\n'''Realistic Battles:'''\n\nIn realistic battles, you are guaranteed to destroy a base if you stay high. Do not under any circumstance dive bomb bases. Fly level and maintain altitude, and nothing will be able to climb to catch you. However, you can also destroy ground targets while flying at low level. If you need to destroy ground targets, take the 6x 100kg bombs. The defensive armament in this plane is rather decent when the enemy is travelling at low speed. The ShKAS machine guns have a really fast rate of fire and good damage output. Just remember that these guns jam VERY quickly compared to other guns. Be mindful when pressing the trigger.\n\nThe SB 2M should be landed with care. Not only does it like to bounce up into the air again, but a very light touch on the brakes is required, because it is very easy to nose over, even at surprisingly low speeds. Flying several practice takeoff and landing cycles in test flight mode is highly recommended.\n\n'''Simulator Battles:'''\n\nIn Sim, the overall tactic remains the same as other bombers: base/airfield bombing. However, the SB 2M is super hard to control in the pitch. If you leave the stick at the dead zone, the aircraft will automatically climb or dive which will lead to a crash if unnoticed. Trimming doesn't help. For the gunner view, even though you might have the \"autopilot when in gunner view\" enabled, it won't help either, as it will still continuously pitch up and down like a boat. Also note that when switching to gunner view, it will sometimes uncontrollably roll to one side which will make it enter a spin quickly. Therefore this bomber is extremely frustrating to fly in simulator.\n\nWhen bombing airfields, make sure to fly above 2,000 m to avoid the anti-aircraft artillery, as this plane is unprotected and its cooling systems will often be damaged, leading to the engines overheating. You should familiarise with each module of the airfield to maximise the damage. The airstrip is the most visible and the easiest one to hit, however, bombing it seems to halve your reward. So it is recommended to bomb everything else: hangar, fuel area, living quarters, etc. The plane hangars are probably easy since they aren't too small.\n\nGiven its huge wings compared to the rather skinny fuselage, it can be tricky to land as it will bounce off the ground and leap into the air again and again, no matter how slow it seems to fly. The trick is to slow it down more than any other twin-engine plane, plus set up key binds for \"flaps down\" and \"flaps up\" to replace the default \"toggle flaps\". This way you can use the wanted flap anytime. When approaching the airfield, make sure to descend to around 400 m when you are approximately 2 km away from the start of the runway. This is an appropriate distance to decelerate. As the airstrip occupies 1/3 of your windscreen, reduce speed to approximately 220 km/h, deploy combat flaps and cancel out that extra lift by pitching down. When you are almost touching down, reduce speed to no more than 160 km/h (seems dangerously slow but it can still glide safely), deploy landing gear, take-off flaps and pitch down even more so the SB 2M remains overall parallel to the ground. At the last second before touch down, make sure you are around 130 km/h and deploy landing flaps. This way the bomber can land gently and softly, and will not bounce off. At last, do not constantly hold the brake. Release brake immediately once the nose starts to dip down to avoid propeller strike.\n\n'''Against the SB 2M (all modes but mostly in sim):'''\n\nYou should be very careful against bombers since with the Sim control (whether it be mouse joystick or a real stick) the plane will manoeuvre much more gently, making yourself a great target for the bomber's gunners. DO NOT follow behind the SB 2M's six unless you are sure that its tail gunners are unconscious. Chasing behind the SB 2M makes yourself pretty much stationary for the tail gunners, and you will be showered with 7.62 mm bullets.\n\nIf your plane is an early biplane armed with weak MGs (2-4 x 7.7 mm or below), you should use deflection shots. That is, imagine yourself as an anti-air missile, predict where you two will meet and fly towards that point. This way it gives the gunners little window to open fire at you. When firing, try to aim for the cockpit for a possible pilot-snipe, as the pilot is very unprotected or aim at its engines to damage it or the cooler. Without an engine, the SB 2M won't fly far.\n\nIf you are flying an interceptor/heavy fighter that is heavily armed and armoured, you can just sit behind the SB 2M and confidently take out its crew/modules one by one, as its 7.62 mm machine gun has rather weak penetration and damage. This is the most precise way of damaging an aircraft, however, the safest tactic is still, and will always be deflection shooting. One accurate burst will critically damage the weak airframe of the SB 2M, or snap off its wing straight away.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The only controls present are Mixture and radiator. Keep the mixture at 60% when flying at higher altitudes, and adjust the mixture to 90% when flying nearer to the ground. The radiator can be kept at 20% normally, even under WEP. If the engine starts to overheat in hotter climates, keep opening the radiator till the temperature returns to normal.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Quite fast for a bomber\n* Relatively effective defensive armament if used against biplanes like [[He 51 (Family)|He 51]] or early monoplanes like [[I-16 (Family)|I-16]]\n* Fast rate of fire for defensive armament\n* Good aircraft to bring into Realistic tank battles\n* Decent arc of fire from gunners, few blind spots\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Almost no protection in terms of armour\n* Relatively weak airframe\n* Bomb load inadequate against bases - more for vehicles, pillboxes, ships and anti-aircraft positions\n* Exposed gunners mean that they get quickly knocked out\n* Easily catches fire if fuel tanks are hit\n* Almost non-existent stock climb rate\n* In Simulator, it is extremely hard to control. No matter how precisely you trim, it will always automatically pitch up and down. Also when switching to gunner view, it will roll, causing a death spin\n* Dorsal gunner cannot fire directly backwards, leaving it quite vulnerable to attacks from behind\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

N. Tupolev and A. A. Arkhangelski. A prototype ANT-40-1 made its first flight on 7 October 1934. Full-scale production of the aircraft under the designation of SB (meaning \"High-Speed Bomber\") was launched in February 1936.\n\nWhen creating the new aircraft, the designers paid much attention to the plane's aerodynamic superiority, considering this one of the most important components necessary to obtain high speed. Many structural and technological decisions were made to improve the plane's aerodynamics. It was the first time that an aircraft of this class had smooth metal skin instead of more rigid, corrugated skin; also, new high-strength materials were introduced, flush riveting used, retractable landing gear installed, and crew cockpits enclosed. The SB included the most advanced achievements in the field of aerodynamics, aircraft materials, and technology. As a result, during tests, the ANT-40 prototype nearly matched the maximum speed of the I-16 fighter.\n\nThe first production SB planes had 750 hp Klimov М-100 twelve-cylinder, V-type, liquid-cooled engines (a licensed version of the French Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engine).\n\nThe engines were fitted with cowls featuring a frontal circular radiator which was completely covered by movable shutters which regulated the incoming air flow. The first production SBs were equipped with two-bladed, fixed-pitch metal propellers.\n\nThe SB's defensive armament included three gun posts: a starboard post, an upper post, and a hatch post. The starboard mount in the navigator's cockpit consisted of two 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns with a total magazine capacity of 1,900 rounds. The TUR-9 upper turret was equipped with one ShKAS machine gun whose magazine capacity was 1,000 rounds. The LU hatch mount, with one ShKAS machine gun carrying 500 rounds, was intended for cover the aircraft's lower rear. All of the machine guns were belt-fed, which was also was a revolutionary innovation: the rest of the world mostly continued to use detachable magazines.\n\nThe bombing armament of the first-series SBs was housed only inside the bomb bay, on two DER-33 horizontal racks (on which FAB-500 or FAB-250 bombs could be suspended) or four DER-34 vertical racks (for FAB-100 bombs or bomb clusters). The plane's maximum bomb capacity was 600 kg (6 FAB-100 bombs, suspended vertically).\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sb_2m_100 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|1R9OL0Hf-yw|'''The Shooting Range #33''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:10 discusses the SB 2M.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Martin [[B-10B]]\n* [[Martin 139WC]]\n* Fiat [[BR.20 DR]]\n* Heinkel [[He 111 H-3]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Tupolev}}\n{{USSR bombers}}"}}
