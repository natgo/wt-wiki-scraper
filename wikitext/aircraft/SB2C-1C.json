In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American naval dive-bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.51 \"Cold Steel\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe SB2C-1c has surprisingly good manoeuvrability for a dive-bomber (especially at an airspeed of around 300 km/h), although its weight means that acceleration is not outstanding and climb rate is poor. Top speed is also below-average. However, as a primarily air-to-ground attacker, these somewhat lacklustre flight characteristics do not overly hinder the vehicle's utility.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,084 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nIn Air Realistic battles, the SB2C receives an air start, which means that it is usually able to intercept enemy fighters in their climb path. When this happens, the Helldiver is very effective in a head-on role, with 2 powerful 20 mm cannons. If stealth belts are loaded, the enemy may not even realise that they are being shot at, since they may not expect a bomber to have offensive capabilities. Another way to deal with enemy fighters is in a dogfighting role. The SB2C has a surprisingly good turn rate, especially at around 300 km/h, and can turn with such planes as the [[La-5]] and [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]] series of fighters. Often, the enemy will be caught off guard by the Helldiver's dogfighting ability and enter into an engagement that they cannot win, allowing the pilot to secure the kill.\n\nHowever, the SB2C is certainly not the perfect fighter aircraft: it has a poor climb rate, poor acceleration, and is quite heavy. Therefore, it struggles against experienced enemy fighters, and the best way to fly this plane in an anti-air role is by supporting teammates and working with a group. If there is an enemy on your tail, luring them towards friendlies may be the best option. Since the Helldiver is heavy and sluggish, it can be hard to shake a tail. There is a rear gunner, but they are only armed with 2 x 7.62 mm machine guns, and are not very well protected from enemy fire. As such, it would be unwise to rely on them in every sticky situation.\n\nAnother possible way to use this vehicle is in a ground-attack role. This can be done in Ground, Air, or Naval battles, since the Helldiver is able to carry both bombs and torpedoes. For attacking ground targets, it is recommended to use a diving attack (the vehicle is equipped with an airbrake for just this purpose) and drop ordnance when directly over the enemy. Keep in mind that this vehicle does not carry much ordnance, so it is important to make each drop count. If the bombs have been used up, then it is possible to use the 2 x 20 mm cannons against lightly armoured ground targets as well, although more heavily-armoured tanks and pillboxes will be difficult to crack. In naval battles, this plane is one of few to receive a torpedo for use against ships.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The aircraft had been produced from 1943-1945. It was meant to replace the Douglas SBD Dauntless as a much faster alternative to the SBD Dauntless though it sacrificed mobility. Many of the crews of the SB2C Helldiver nicked named this aircraft \"Big-Tailed Beast\", \"Two-Cee\", and Son of a Bitch Second Class due to the horrible turning capabilities of the aircraft. The aircraft mainly saw service in the United States Navy, United States Army Air Forces, French Air Force, and Royal Thai Air Force. It was a much larger version of the SBD Dauntless but many of the pilots that flew the SB2C were disappointed with the turning capability which led many pilots to go back to the outdated SBD Dauntless as it had better turning but less speed but many pilots preferred it rather than the SB2C. A total of 7,140 aircraft were produced in total from 1943-1945.\n\n=== SB2C-1c ===\nThe SB2C-1c Helldiver was based on the SB2C-1 - the first production model. It replaced the four .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns of the SB2C-1 with two 20 mm cannons. It also included new hydraulically operated flaps. Because the SB2C-1 was used only for training, after only 200 were built because of the issues with the design. As such, the SB2C-1c was the first variant to be deployed. 778 SB2C-1c Helldivers were built, and it was the first variant to see combat.\n\nThe SB2C Helldiver was used during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, where 45 were lost after running out of fuel while returning to the carriers. The SB2C took part in combat over the Marianas, Philippines, Taiwan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. In the Battle of Leyte Gulf, during the Philippines Campaign, SB2C Helldivers took part in the sinking of the IJN Musashi; they scored a number of bomb hits to the ship. At Okinawa, Helldivers participated in the sinking of the IJN Yamato during the Japanese Operation Ten-Go, scoring hits on the Yamato and her escorts.\n\nIn 1945, Helldivers were used in attacks on the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese island of Honshū. In those strikes they were used to attack airfields, communication centers, and shipping. After the two atomic bombs were dropped, the Helldiver was used in patrols until the official Japanese surrender and the subsequent occupation of Japan.\n\nAfter the war, the SB2C remained in active-duty service with the US Navy until 1947, and with the Naval Reserve until 1950.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sb2c_1c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|uJziizNMYj8|'''The Shooting Range #164''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:12 discusses the SB2C Helldiver.|_mhSXtNN9Ko|'''The Shooting Range #200''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 06:03 discusses the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[SB2 (Disambiguation)]]\n** [[SB2C-4]], successor to the 1c variant\n* [[SBD-3]], the SB2C-1c's predecessor\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/793|SB2C-1c Helldiver: Official Devblog]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/250822-curtiss-sb2c-1c/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [https://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=265 SB2C-1c: MilitaryFactory.com]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/250823-sb2c-helldiver-official-thread/ SB2C-1c: Official Forum thread]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Curtiss}}\n{{USA bombers}}"}}
