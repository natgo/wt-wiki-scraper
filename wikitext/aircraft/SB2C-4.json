It was introduced in [[Update 1.53 \"Firestorm\"]].\n\nThe SB2C-4 is an upgrade from the earlier [[SB2C-1c]] dive bomber at Rank II, having a more powerful engine and the ability to mount more payloads, including HVAR rockets. However, this version faces tougher and more deadly aircraft due to a higher ''Battle Rating''.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Arcade Battles\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is very much like it's older sibling model in-game, which is a dive bomber/attacker capable of wreaking havoc to both soft and hard ground targets and enemy bases. Despite its capability to carry rockets and under-wing bombs and be used as an attacker, '''do not''' attempt to do so, unless you are sure a nearby enemy fighter does not immediately single you out as a target. This aircraft has fairly good manoeuvrability but does not fly nearly as well as any of the fighters you may encounter. However, this does not mean you cannot defend yourself in dire times. A distinct advantage of this aircraft is its firepower is more than enough to bring down any attacking enemy pilot with some skill, however, it's instability in coming out of rough turns can cause problems on getting guns on target difficult. Most pilots don't expect you to carry so much firepower with the extra machine guns so taking head-ons with some planes can work in your favour because most pilots do not expect you to have that much firepower. Moreover, due to it's firepower and ''airspawn'', being a bomber hunter is no problem either. It is important to remember to use this plane's main niche to your advantage as you will be vulnerable to enemy gunners. This plane's niche as fast bomber is further reinforced compared to the SB2C-1c as it carries double the bomb load (2,000 lb/ 907 kg) and if you survive long enough with your firepower to defend yourself you can be a considerable drain to the enemy's ticket counter. Overall, this aircraft is a solid performer in Arcade battles which is a delightful blend of defensive/offensive firepower, speed (not fighter-like though), manoeuvrability and bombing capability specifically for a dive bomber. A recommended aircraft to take out in ''tier 3'' battles and as a ''silver lions'' factory!\n\n;Realistic Battles\n\nIn Realistic Battles, the {{PAGENAME}} excels at the ground attack role. Use the bombs and rockets against hard targets (such as heavy pillboxes and tanks), and the 20 mm cannons for taking out soft targets and light pillboxes. Even the universal ammo belt with 50/50 HEF and AP can take out light pillboxes when aiming for the roof, but belts with more AP will make it easier. However, its use doesn't end there. The SB2C is surprisingly manoeuvrable for a dive bomber, which combined with its high bomber spawn, effective armament, and dive brakes mean it can be used to dive on enemy fighters and bombers, and can even hold its own in a dogfight, especially if the enemy underestimates the plane's manoeuvrability. These characteristics are also good tactics for defending yourself, markedly since the tail gunner is lacklustre. Unfortunately, this does not apply well when at a low energy state (ex: ground attacking at a low level). The SB2C has poor climb rate and acceleration, and experienced pilots will boom and zoom you and leave you few options to defend yourself (trying to get guns on target after an overshoot, forcing a head-on, etc). Instead, try to stay above the battle and go for enemy aircraft, and once your team has a numerical advantage, go to ground level and ground attack, preferably under cover of fighters.\n\n;Fighting a {{PAGENAME}}\n\nIf you come across a {{PAGENAME}}, attack from its unprotected bottom which is easy to hit due to planes low speed and pilots rarely looking below their planes. Avoid attacking it when it is in a dive\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This helped to solve the power to weight issues of the earlier models. The SB2C-4 added eight wing racks for carrying 5 in (127 mm) HVAR unguided rockets, with four on each wing. Additionally, mountings for one 500 lb bomb on each wing were added - a total of two 500 lb bombs; these could be carried when not carrying rockets. These armament options were in addition to the centerline bomb bay in the fuselage, which could carry up to 2,000 lbs of ordnance. 2,045 SB2C-4 aircraft were produced, making it the most produced variant of the SB2C Helldiver.\n\nThe SB2C Helldiver was used during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, where 45 were lost after running out of fuel while returning to the carriers. The SB2C took part in combat over the Marianas, Philippines, Taiwan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. In the Battle of Leyte Gulf, during the Philippines Campaign, SB2C Helldivers took part in the sinking of the IJN Musashi; they scored a number of bomb hits to the ship. At Okinawa, Helldivers participated in the sinking of the IJN Yamato during the Japanese Operation Ten-Go, scoring hits on the Yamato and her escorts.\n\nIn 1945, Helldivers were used in attacks on the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese island of Honshū. In those strikes they were used to attack airfields, communication centers, and shipping. After the two atomic bombs were dropped, the Helldiver was used in patrols until the official Japanese surrender and the subsequent occupation of Japan.\n\nAfter the war, the SB2C remained in active-duty service with the US Navy until 1947, and with the Naval Reserve until 1950.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n{{Youtube-gallery|uJziizNMYj8|'''The Shooting Range #164''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:12 discusses the SB2C Helldiver.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/272430-curtiss-sb2c-4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Curtiss}}\n{{USA bombers}}"}}
