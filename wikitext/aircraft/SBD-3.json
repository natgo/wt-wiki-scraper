Although the engine is relatively weak, it could be WEP-ed for a long time before it reaches the overheating stage. This is not an aircraft which you will want to fly at high altitudes but should remain lower where it is a capable dive bomber.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Dauntless is an underrated aircraft, as it is viewed as a weak and sluggish bomber by a majority of tier 1 players. Use this to your advantage by catching unsuspecting bombers and fighters. Its manoeuvrability is good enough to energy fight the enemy. You should try to keep your speed higher than 200 km/h and stay at altitudes lower than 2km.\n\nThis plane is good at what it was designed for Dive Bombing. Start at a high altitude at around 4-5,000 feet, fly directly above the target, invert the plane, cut the throttle and deploy airbrakes (H key by default), dive, at 1,000-700 feet release bombs, pull the nose up, retract air brakes, push the throttle to full, then pitch up in a climb.\n\nThe small bomb load requires you pick your targets carefully and make your bombs count, choose to attack artillery positions or bases, where you have a higher chance of hitting due to their stationary position. Ships are also prime targets (it is what it was designed for), as the 1000lb bomb is plenty to sink a small ship.\n\nDo not rely on fighter support when focusing on ground targets. After you drop your bombs, the plane should be manoeuvrable enough to dogfight enemies. You should stay on deck and manoeuvre wisely to not expose your weak underbelly. If you are caught at high altitude, go into a steep dive until you are at the deck, there is a good chance you may out dive them. If you cannot lose the enemy, try to quickly turn to your enemy's direction. your high G tolerance is equal, if not better than most enemies so you could lose them if they cant follow your turn.\n\n'''Realistic battles'''\n\nWith the gun pods attached, you could act as menacing fighter support. With a high altitude spawn, try to hunt bombers first before you consider killing fighters. climb up to 4,500 m to get your max speed so you can dive down to the bombers. After eliminating a bomber or two, you should find that your allies are starting to engage the enemy. You could help them by catching enemies that are turning, have low speed, or attacking an ally. It should be easy to do all of this because of your energy advantage. You are still marked as a bomber, so enemies will surely consider you as an easy kill. You can not outrun them, but you can turn very well at almost every speed except stall. If they are coming from behind, a sudden reverse would be a good manoeuvre to throw them off. After that, you could either perform a head-on or fly under the enemy to avoid them. Avoid rushing upwards to maintain speed. Combine all of that with good trigger discipline, it is possible to achieve a five kill game.\n\n'''Simulator battles'''\n\nHands-off carrier take-off (Auto engine control): Start the engine, flaps: raised, elevator trim: 15%, aileron trim: 11%, rudder trim: 6%, WEP throttle, hands-off controls until you lift off the carrier.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting'''\n\n[[Yak-2 KABB]]: Do not think that the {{PAGENAME}} can confidently outmanoeuvre this plane just because it is twin-engined. The Yak-2 has an amazing turn rate for a heavy fighter, thus the {{PAGENAME}} must avoid turning with it, if not dogfighting with it in general. It bears a pair of ShVAK cannons that can easily damage vital parts like engine or cooling systems. It has green camo, greatly resembling an Me 410 but with an H-tail like a Bf 110's.\n\n'''Facing the SBD'''\n\nIt is very common in the game to encounter the SBD equipped with the gunpods, instead of its more usual historical role as a dive bomber. If you are playing against the Americans, in a battle rating where you are likely to encounter it, and especially if you are on a base-bombing run, it is wise to assume that you are facing six forward-firing .50 cal M2 machine guns, until proven otherwise. The best countermeasures are altitude, speed, and manoeuvrability.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Extremely useful for attacking weakly armoured tanks\n* Decent dive characteristics\n* Will not break its wing on high G turns up to 600 km/h\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* It is still a dive bomber, so its manoeuvrability is limited by its poor energy retention\n* Low ammo capacity for the nose-mounted machine guns\n* The tail gunner won't do so much, because he is too exposed and the 2 x 7.62 is not powerful enough to destroy planes of its tier\n* Limited selection of bombs, only one payload is available to choose from\n* Slow acceleration\n* Poor climb rate\n* Poor energy retention\n* Slow speed\n* WEP only works on low altitude\n* Unprotected engine, any gunfire get your engine knocked out or badly damaged, forcing you to return to base\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

Retired 1959. Produced from 1940 to 1944. Top speed of 410 km/h (255 mph). 1,200 hp engine. Length: 33 feet. Wing span is roughly 41 feet. Empty weight: 2,905 kg (6,404 lb). Gross weight is 4,245 kg (10,400 lb). Bomb load is 544 kg (1,200 lb). \n\nThe SBD-3, also known as the Dauntless is an American dive-bomber from the early 1940s. It was a carrier-based aircraft which was used for scouting and bombing. This plane is most famous for its contribution to the Battle of Midway. This battle was the first major naval victory for the Americans, of which four Japanese carriers were sunk and multiple other ships heavily damaged and sunk.\n\nPilots and gunners of the SBD-3 and other military personnel gave the bomber the nickname \"Slow But Deadly\". Although this plane was slow, it has a large wing area and thus high manoeuvrability. This aircraft is a 2-man crew, so when going into and out of a dive the pilot wouldn't have to check the altitude saving him time, though that was not the only use of the gunner/radioman he would cover the pilot, engaging any enemy fighters who would come behind the aircraft and could also double as a radioman.\n\nThese incredible planes all saw service in the United States Navy, United States Army Air Corps, United States Marine Corps and the Free French Air Force. There were 5,936 SBD-3 made; unfortunately, only four or five original US Navy planes survive today with the rest being replicas.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nA carrier-based dive-bomber/reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nThe most well-known U.S. Navy bomber, and perhaps the most significant dive-bomber of the war. Despite the fact that the decision to write off the SBD as outdated was made before the war, the bomber was still actively involved in combat, and in 1942 it sunk more enemy ships than all other Navy aircraft combined.\n\nOriginally, the series was called the XBT, and showed as many innovations as it did drawbacks. This aircraft had a revolutionary honeycomb wing structure and a reasonably small fuselage. But its wings could not be folded, and occasionally it would spontaneously go into a barrel roll, which caused a series of catastrophic accidents. After intensive research in conjunction with NACA, the dive-bomber was radically redesigned, most of its shortcomings were removed, and it was named the Scout Bomber.\n\nThe SBD-3 variant was a Scout Bomber which was finally fit for combat. It had self-sealing fuel tanks, armour, and bulletproof cockpit glass. To keep its performance characteristics, the aircraft's weight was reduced by replacing its duralumin sheeting with a much lighter material. Also, all the equipment designed to keep the plane afloat in the event of a water landing was removed.\n\nSoldiers dubbed the SBD the \"Slow But Deadly\". This aircraft destroyed the pride of the Japanese carrier force at the Battle of Midway, inflicting damage from which the Japanese Imperial Navy was never able to recover.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sbd-3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|rnfxWsXct9E|'''The Shooting Range #12''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:47 discusses the Douglas SBD Dauntless.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[SB2 (Disambiguation)|SB2 dive bombers]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4442-profile-sbd-3-dauntless-slow-but-deadly-en|[Profile] SBD-3 Dauntless - Slow But Deadly]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/491957-sbd-3/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Douglas}}\n{{USA bombers}}"}}
