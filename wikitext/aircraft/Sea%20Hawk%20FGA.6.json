Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 \"Locked On\"]].\n\nAt the tail end of World War II, Hawker Aircraft's design team was working on the way to utilize new jet engine technology. Hawker utilized a modified Sea Fury who would be the basis for their new jet aircraft. Adapting the plane to the new Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine required substantial reworking of the aircraft fuselage. Initially, the British Air Ministry showed little interest in the aircraft. Thus later Hawker pitched the idea of the plane to the navy, which was not overly enthused about the project, though ultimately accepted three prototypes due to the long-range potential of these aircraft.\n\nOrders for the Hawker Sea Hawk came about; however, due to its careful designs, it was quickly superseded by other British fighters in development with more advanced features. In 1956 production was terminated and the aircraft was put up for an evaluation to the export market. Though Australia and Canada tested out the plane, they instead opted for American fighters. Other nations such as Germany, the Netherlands and India incorporated the Sea Hawk into their navies. Eventually, they saw action in the Suez Crisis and the Indo-Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971. India was able to sink over a dozen Pakistani ships without a single Sea Hawk loss.\n\nThough the Sea Hawk is classified as a fighter, it is primarily a ground-pounding aircraft. With an assortment of bombs and rockets in conjunction with its four 20 mm autocannons, this aircraft can make short work of structures and vehicles on the ground. One benefit of this aircraft compared to others is the ability to mix and match your ordnance depending on the task at hand. The pilot can choose from only bombs, only rockets (two different types) or a mix of both. As noted, the Sea Hawk weapon's configuration outfits four 20 mm autocannons. These guns are arranged for optimal use against the ground and air targets; in fact, they are the only weapons on this aircraft which can be effectively used in air-to-air battles.\n\nThough the Sea Hawk development did not configure this aircraft to be an interceptor like many of its swept-wing contemporaries, it can nonetheless be a worthy adversary that can seem to pull off the impossible. With straight wings and a slower top speed, this fighter is a bit more manoeuvrable than many of the Mach-plus fighters it will face. Careful usage of the flaps, air brakes and manoeuvring can cause faster aircraft to overshoot, leaving their tail-ends vulnerable to being chewed off by the Sea Hawk's four 20 mm autocannons. Sea Hawks should not be counted off as an easy target. In the hands of a capable pilot, they can quickly get behind you and open fire!\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIn Air Realistic battles, you have a good top speed with okay acceleration and a decent climb rate (particularly when fully upgraded). After takeoff, build speed to about 500 kph then enter a 10 degree climb (a 10 degree climb straight off the runway can also work in some situations). You can either continue climbing to high altitude (~5 km) to engage high flying bombers /fighters and gain an altitude advantage; or you can choose to level off at 3-4 km and focus on building speed to engage enemy fighters and bombers at lower altitudes (aircraft such as [[Ar 234 C-3]]s and [[IL-28]]s will often fly low to get to bases/ground targets quickly) depending on your preferred play-style.\n\nWhen engaging enemy aircraft, use your good speed and excellent energy retention to your advantage; do not bleed speed to keep on a slower enemy's tail; swoop in fire off a burst of rounds and then break contact and come around for another pass. The Sea Hawk has good manoeuvrability for a jet aircraft (although it is not in the same league as the [[Vampire FB 5|Vampire]] and [[Ho 229 V3|Ho 229]]), and your energy retention does make limited turning engagements with less manoeuvrable targets a valid option in some situation, although you will bleed too much speed to justify prolonged turn fights. You can safely deploys flaps at any speed below 850 kph and they can significantly increase turning ability, however they create a lot of drag (you will not hold 600 kph in level flight with them deployed) so should be used sparingly. A good tactic is to deploy the flaps as you enter or are in mid-turn to help kick the plane around and then undeploy them as soon as possible afterwards. Do not get complacent with the flaps, although you can use them at most speeds. The Sea Hawk can exceed 900 kph so you may be in for a nasty surprise if you deploy them a full speed.\n\nIt is also worth remembering that the Sea Hawk is a naval aircraft, unlocking the ability to use aircraft carriers for takeoff and landing. A carrier spawn can sometimes be desirable, be it for putting you further away / closer to the enemy (more climbing time or quicker action), or giving you the chance to attack from an area of the map the enemy team are not expecting. Likewise if you need to rearm and suspect the enemy are waiting for you at the airfield, you can always divert to a carrier.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Extremely high flap breakage speed (850 km/h for takeoff, 796 km/h for landing)\n* Good selection of suspended armament options\n* Favourable matchmaking in Air Realistic battles with the only up-tier threats being the ([[F9F (Family)|F9Fs]] and [[G.91 pre-serie]])\n* Reasonably quick\n* Good manoeuvrability (not as good as [[Vampire FB 5|Vampire]] though)\n* Very good energy retention\n* Decent at climbing\n* High maximum G loading, hard to rip the wings off\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* No combat flaps\n* Slow acceleration\n* Although takeoff flaps can be used at near any speed and can offer a decent manoeuvrability boost, you bleed speed quickly when they are deployed\n* Flaps also double as air brakes, if flaps are deployed you need to wait for them to fully retract before you can use air brakes\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

As a basis for their new aircraft, they took the Hawker Fury and began adapting it to house a turbojet engine. The project received the designation P.1035.\n\nAs work went on, the attention the project garnered initially from the Air Ministry and the Admiralty was rather low and eventually dropped completely, forcing Hawker to continue development of the aircraft under a private venture. During the development process, the initial design of the aircraft underwent significant changes and the resulting version was designated as P.1040.\n\nHowever, as Hawker's aircraft offered a good range, the Navy ordered three prototypes to be built in May 1946 and subsequently put through evaluation. Testing and tweaking of the design continued throughout the late 1940s until the first production orders for the aircraft, dubbed Sea Hawk, were received in November 1949.\n\nThe first Sea Hawks entered service with the FAA in 1953, with the remaining over 500 machines entering service by the mid-1950s. The Sea Hawk's service life is primarily marked by their extensive use during the Suez Crisis in the late 1950s, where they successfully proved themselves.\n\nAs one of the last modifications of the type, the Sea Hawk FGA.6 was developed to incorporate changes from the previous FB.3 and FGA.4 ground attack variants and combine them with the new Rolls-Royce Nene Mk.103 engine which provided a greater power output.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the British Navy almost completely abandoned the use of Sea Hawk and a handful of other vehicles being used in a limited number of secondary roles until the end of the decade. However, the aircraft was still in service by some countries like West Germany, the Netherlands and India. In fact, India continued to operate Sea Hawks well into the 1980s!\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6039-development-sea-hawk-fga-6-jet-vulture-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=jet_fighter&vehicle=sea_hawk_fga6 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Sea Hawk FGA 6 WTWallpaper 001.jpg\nFile:Sea Hawk FGA 6 WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:Sea Hawk FGA 6 WTWallpaper 003.jpg\nFile:Sea Hawk FGA 6 WTWallpaper 004.jpg\nFile:Sea Hawk FGA 6 WTWallpaper 005.jpg\nFile:Sea Hawk FGA 6 WTWallpaper 006.jpg\nFile:Sea Hawk FGA 6 WTWallpaper 007.jpg\nFile:Sea Hawk FGA 6 WTWallpaper 008.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|QsshIFf_eYc|'''Blood Sweat and Tears!
