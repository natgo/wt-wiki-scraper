In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British naval fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 \"Weapons of Victory\"]].\n\nAs the name implies, this is a carrier based version of the Hurricane. The Mk I/L is the closest counterpart, however several key differences are present. First off, this version can operate from carriers. This grants a massive improvement in versatility, as you can launch from both airfields and carriers. In addition, this variant features reinforced landing gear in order to survive hard carrier landings. However, the extra weight of the landing gear is also the Sea Hurricane's biggest flaw. In Arcade, this makes minimal difference to performance, but Realistic and Simulator are a different story. Climb rate, turning ability, and minimum take-off speed are all noticeably worse. That doesn't mean this is a bad aircraft though. It just takes a pilot with the knowledge of these facts and how to counter them to succeed with the plane. Boom and zoom tactics can be used to greater effect than the [[Hurricane Mk I/L]] thanks to improved dive acceleration from the extra mass. The only problem is getting up there. Still, this is a very good aircraft when used properly.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nDue to the extra weight, the {{PAGENAME}} has an slightly inferior flight performance compared to the [[Hurricane Mk I/L]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,962 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Hurricane is one of the first monoplane fighters in the British tech tree. As such it will face a mix of biplanes and monoplanes with a different playstyle required for each.\n\nAgainst biplanes, the Hurricane plays similarly to a heavy fighter. The large number of guns allows you to down anyone in your crosshairs quickly even if you don't have the best aim. Do not try to dogfight biplanes. While it is possible to win a dogfight against biplanes, it will bleed all of your plane's energy forcing you to continue to turnfight any enemies that decided to join the fight even if it is not in your best interest. You are better off BnZing biplanes. They might be able to tickle your rear as you extend away due to their quick turn time and your relatively slow speed but the Hurricane is durable enough to survive some MG fire.\n\nAgainst monoplanes, the Hurricane must be played in the complete opposite fashion. Your plane will likely be slower and climb far worse than your opponent however your turn rate will likely be better, so try to force them into a turnfight. Monoplanes also generally carry heavier armament so your durability advantage is negated.\n\nOverall the Hurricane is a novice-friendly plane with high firepower and predictable flight characteristics that can be taken to the next level with careful energy management.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The Mk IB featured catapult spools and an arrestor hook. Starting in July of 1941, the Sea Hurricane Mk IB operated from HMS ''Furious'' and starting in October 1941 they operated from Merchant aircraft carriers (cargo ships modified with a flight deck). On 31 July 1941, Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron, operating from HMS ''Furious'', shot down a Do 18 flying boat - the first aerial victory of the aircraft. From testing, the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) preferred de Havilland propellers to the Rotol propellers. This was because the heavier Rotol propeller could cause the plane to dip forward and the propeller would hit the carrier deck, while the lighter de Havilland propellers could avoid this issue.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=hurricane_mk1b Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Hawker}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
