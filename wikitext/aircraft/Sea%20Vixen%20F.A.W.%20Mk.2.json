The engines are both mounted in the centre of the airframe, with fuel tanks mainly in the wings. The tail overall is fairly weak and can be blown off easily by large calibre cannons, however the flap on the rear of the elevator can sometimes absorb shots, protecting the main elevator from damage. Unfortunately the Sea Vixen generally handles poorly when damaged, performance is reduced fairly significantly by damage to the wings and asymmetric damage can make control very difficult.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n[[File:Sea Vixen Wiki Image 3.jpg|thumb|Sea Vixen launching a [[Firestreak]] AAM.]]\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Air Realistic battles\n\nThe Red Tops are generally much better missiles to equip, compared to the Firestreaks, as they have the largest warhead of any air-to-air missile in game and have a slightly better top speed (Mach 2.5). Because of this, the Sea Vixen's best tactic is to climb to one side at the start of the battle and attack enemy bombers. The Red Tops are very good for attacking from the side and this tactic is a good idea to avoid enemy tail gunners and will make your missile more likely to hit because of the Red Tops' poor range from the rear.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Red Tops in Boom-n-Zoom attacks on enemy fighters, who are not watching out for missiles or fighters, which have lost speed. The Red Tops are most useful when fired from the side between 1.0 and 2.5 km range. Avoid getting into dogfights as the Sea Vixen has no cannons and its missiles will be useless, unless you have allies to cover you or can force the enemy fighter to climb and lose speed.\n\nEnemies worth noting: All MiG 15s and 17s as they can out turn you and [[A-4E Early]] as they have flares when fully modified, which will make your missiles redundant if used.\n\n[[File:Sea Vixen Wiki Image 4.jpg|thumb|Sea Vixen after destroying a target with its [[AGM-12B Bullpup|AGM-12B]] Bullpup.]]\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

De Havilland began producing an aircraft, the DH 110, to fulfill this requirement. However, the Fleet Air Arm decided to proceed with the Sea Venom instead as it was cheaper and available sooner. In spite of this, De Havilland continued work on the DH 110 independently, finishing the first prototype in September of 1951. This prototype exceeded expectations and could regularly attain supersonic speeds during test flights.\n\nTragedy soon struck when the DH 110 prototype disintegrated in midair during the Farnborough Airshow in 1952, resulting in the deaths of 31 people including the crew of two. As a result, the DH 110 underwent significant design changes to improve its structural stability, resulting in its maximum speed being reduced to Mach 0.91. This aircraft was offered to the Fleet Air Arm and replaced the previous Sea Venoms as the RN's primary air defence fighter. In February of 1955, 110 aircraft were ordered, with the name \"Sea Vixen\".\n\nThe Sea Vixen was built with an unconventional twin-boom design, which de Havilland had perfected through its design of the twin-boomed [[Vampire FB 5|Vampire]] and [[Venom FB.4|Venom]] fighters. The Sea Vixen was also the first British combat aircraft with no internal gun armament, relying entirely on its suspended ordnance. The FAW.1 variant was capable of carrying 4 Firestreak AAMs for fleet defence, while the FAW.2 variant could carry the more advanced Red Top missile. The aircraft had two Rolls-Royce Avon engines producing 33 kN of thrust each and a crew of two, with the pilot's canopy offset to the left and the radar operator's seat flush within the fuselage.\n\nThe first Sea Vixens entered service with frontline squadrons in 1959. The Sea Vixen failed to see any combat action during its short service, but served with the Fleet Air Arm in deployments off of Iraq, Tanganyika (part of modern-day Tanzania), Indonesia, and more. The aircraft were replaced by the more modern [[Phantom FG.1]], a British variant of the American F-4 Phantom II. The last Sea Vixens were retired from active duty in 1972; a total of 145 were built, though 55 had been lost to accidents.\n\n===[[wt:en/news/7160-development-sea-vixen-faw-2-breaking-convention-en|Devblog]]===\n[[File:Sea Vixen Wiki Image 1.jpg|thumb|Sea Vixen on HMS Ark Royal (R09).]]\nDevelopment of the Sea Vixen began in 1946 when de Havilland entered talks with the Admiralty on designing a future radar-equipped naval jet fighter with all-weather capability. Official requirements were drawn up in January 1947, by which time however de Havilland was already working on a design based on the preceding Vampire and Venom fighters designated DH 110.\n\nDespite decreasing interest in the project by the late 1940's, in September 1951, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. However, only a year later, the same prototype crashed during an air show, thus further impeding the project's progress. While the RAF abandoned the idea of purchasing the DH 110 by the mid 1950's, the FAA gained a renewed interest in the aircraft and placed an order for 110 machines to be built in February 1955. Along with the order, the DH 110 received its official designation 'Sea Vixen'.\n\nAs the Sea Vixen entered service with the FAA in 1959, de Havilland took note of the feedback gained from operational use of the aircraft and continued working on the Sea Vixen in an effort to improve its design. As a result, the Sea Vixen FAW.2 made its debut in 1962 which featured a number of improvements, of which one of the more notable ones was the ability to carry the Red Top air-to-air missiles. Over 140 Sea Vixens were built, most of which were converted over to the FAW.2 modification after its commissioning into service.\n\nAlthough the British Sea Vixens never took part in any wars, they were still involved in a number of different combat operations primarily in Africa and the Middle East where they provided fire support for ground troops and flew patrols.\n\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=dh_110_sea_vixen Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Camouflages\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Sea Vixen F.A.W.
