It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 \"Weapons of Victory\"]].\n\nUnlike the previous [[Seafire Mk XVII]] which is a low altitude fighter, the Seafire FR 47 has excellent high altitude performance, and you will perform most competitively above 6-7 km. It is good for engaging other fighters and bombers up to 12 km due to a 2nd supercharger gear that peaks in power at 8.4 km.\n\nIt has has a rather versatile selection of secondary armaments. You can take two 250 lb bombs or two 500 lb bombs. Whilst the first will result in marginally better performance, the latter is preferred for attacking ground vehicles and for pillboxes. The fact that you can carry rockets is even better. You have a choice of either 4 x RP-3 rockets or 8 x RP-3 rockets. It is more advisable to take 8 x rockets as having only 4 will means both your salvos have to be dead-on the target. This isn't helped by the fact that rockets utilized are woefully inaccurate. When strafing a group of AI light tanks, it is at this point when utilizing 4 rockets make a bit more sense as you are almost guaranteed to take out some of the AI vehicles. If in a mixed RB battle, you should probably not even be carrying rockets and should just stick with bombs, however, if you are attacking vehicles with exposed crew members like the 8.8 cm Flak 37 you can benefit a bit more by using the rockets.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!--''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB). -->\nThe Seafire FR 47 excels in high altitude performance, performing best at around 6-7 km. Therefore, it is adept at engaging heavy bombers and high-altitude fighters.\n\nThe plane is a heavier modification of the Griffon Spitfires and in general has a worse climb rate and acceleration than they do. Since climb rate is below-average, side-climbing is recommended in order to gain an altitude advantage over the enemy and to get to those altitudes where the Seafire's engine performance is maximized. Also, this vehicle's turn rate is only average. It certainly isn't a dedicated turnfighter, and usually it is best to stick to a boom and zoom or energy fighting playstyle. In an extended turn, the Seafire can be outmanoeuvred or out-energied by many of the enemies it might face. \n\nAlthough this plane's energy retention, acceleration, climb rate, and manoeuvrability are worse than that of its peers, it does accelerate quite well in a dive; and, remember that engine performance gets better at high altitude. Additionally, the Seafire has a good top speed for its rank.\n\nIf necessary, the Seafire is equipped with an arrestor hook for landing on carriers.\n\nThe Seafire is armed with 4 wing-mounted 20 mm cannons which have a high muzzle velocity and high rate of fire. Although this makes aiming easier, it also means that there is not as much available firing time as the ammunition count might suggest. Trigger discipline is advised. Additionally, the location of the cannons means that convergence must be kept in mind. It is recommended to set a convergence of 300 to 500 m. When attacking lightly armoured or open top ground targets, a higher convergence may be set. Attacking heavily armoured tanks with the Seafire's 20 mm cannons is usually futile, since the rounds cannot penetrate their roof armour in most cases. Still, it is possible to spot and mark such tanks for teammates on the ground to locate and destroy.\n\nSpeaking of ground targets, the Seafire is able to equip up to 2 x 500 lb bombs or 8 RP-3 rockets. Notice that the rocket loadout allows for more attack runs and potentially more kills, than the bomb loadout. However, they must be aimed precisely in order to do the most damage. These ordnance options can be used to attack ships or to destroy ground targets in either Air Realistic or Ground Realistic battles.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).''-->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe last and ultimate incarnation in the life of the legendary Spitfire series, the Seafire F Mk.47 which entered service in 1948 was so different from the Spitfire Mk.I that it was barely recognizable. Now fully navalised after the previous Griffon Seafires' fixed wings, the F Mk.47 was fitted with folding wings and a new Rolls-Royce Griffon 88 which generated 2350 hp at 1250 feet and, fitted with a two-stage two-speed supercharger and petrol injection system, giving a steady flow of fuel under all conditions of accelerated 'g'. The fastest of all Seafires, the F Mk.47 was capable of reaching over 430 mph at some 24,000 feet.\n\nCompared to other contemporary Royal Navy fighters, the Seafire F Mk.47 was faster in the dive and possessed a greater rate of climb above 25,000 feet than the Sea Fury, the Sea Hornet and, incredibly, the jet powered Sea Vampire. The Seafire could also out roll its contemporaries and was beaten in the turn itself only by the Sea Fury. The contra-rotating propellers which had been introduced on the Seafire F Mk.46 were retained, leading to far greater ease of control input in take off, landing and weapons firing due to the near elimination of torque effect with power changes.\n\nFurther modifications included the Spiteful-pattern enlarged fin and rudder, an altered forward fuselage profile and repositioning of the ram-air supercharger intake. Strengthening of the wings allowed a 500 lb bomb to be carried beneath each wing, theoretically allowing the aircraft to carry three 500 lb bombs when also adding a third beneath the fuselage. As with all late marque Seafires, rockets could also be carried. Air-to-air armament consisted of four 20mm Hispano cannon.\n\nWhilst the Seafire F Mk.47 was praised for its control response, handling and deck landing characteristics, it was criticized for its cramped cockpit, uncomfortable seating position, awkward control positioning and lack of modern features such as a properly heated cockpit.\n\nWhilst the Seafire F Mk.47 was one of the greatest piston engine fighters ever produced, it was unfortunately a fighter out of its time period. Advances in jet aircraft meant that piston fighters were finding themselves outclassed more and more with each passing year, and the Seafire F Mk.47 was no exception.\n\nThe F Mk.47 first entered service with 804 Naval Air Squadron at RNAS Ford in January 1948. 90 Seafire F Mk.47s were produced, and first saw action in ground attack sorties against bandits in Malaya in October 1949. 800 NAS embarked aboard HMS Triumph were amongst the first aircraft to take part in the Korean War, taking part in their first offensive sorties in July 1950.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/770|[Devblog] Seafire FR.47 & Sea Fury FB 11]]\n* [[wt:en/news/3268--en|[Vehicle Profile] Supermarine Seafire FR 47]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/235736-supermarine-seafire-fr-mk47/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
