Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Winged Lions\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,963 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThe Seafire LF Mk.III has little protection: your enemies' guns will nearly always hit something vital. The pilot is protected in the rear by a 7 mm steel plate covering the seat, but this is not enough to stop 12.7 mm and 20 mm AP rounds, the kind you will most commonly be facing. The pilot is protected from head-ons by a sloped 38 mm pane of bulletproof glass, and a small amount of armour and fuel tanks in the nose.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)|Browning (7.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 2 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (120 rpg = 240 total)\n* 4 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (350 rpg = 1,400 total)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Seafire LF Mk.III should be played as a turnfighter with a good climb rate. Use the plane's good climb rate to get to around 4,000 m and attack low-flying or otherwise disadvantaged opponents. Attacking bombers is not recommended, as you have little ammunition and your offensive armament is not powerful enough to take out bombers before their defensive armament takes you out. Conserve your energy so you can stay manoeuvrable: it is recommended to build up speed in a straight line after reaching altitude.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* The engine does not overheat easily\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Poor mid and high altitude performance\n* Slower than nearly all opponents\n* Weak armament\n* Outperformed by most other fighters at its tier\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
