Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThe Shackleton MR.Mk.2 has large wings where the fuel tank are located. There are two pilots and eight gunners in total, but only two use turrets, the top gunner and the nose gunner, if the top gunner is taken out the Shackleton becomes much easier to kill. There is only one steel armour plate of 8 mm covering the roof turret gunner.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Mk.II bombs (12,500 lb total)\n* 15 x 1,000 lb M.C. Mk.I bombs (15,000 lb total)\n* 8 x RP-3 rockets\n* 8 x RP-3 rockets + 18 x 250 lb G.P. Mk.IV bombs (4,500 lb total)\n* 8 x RP-3 rockets + 25 x 500 lb H.E. M.C. Mk.II bombs (12,500 lb total)\n* 8 x RP-3 rockets + 15 x 1,000 lb M.C. Mk.I bombs (15,000 lb total)\n\nThe 15 x 1,000 lb M.C. Mk.I loadout is ideal to destroy bases and airfields. Only 5 bombs are required to destroy normal bases and 3 to destroy weaker bases. A squad of 3 Shackletons is capable of destroying all bases and the airfield without landing on some maps. Given that most Air RB maps at its BR consist of respawning bases with a prevalence of attackers, you will rarely be able to drop all 15 bombs on bases without having to wait for at least 1 to respawn\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners.

In addition to this, Britain was faced with a lack of capable long-range maritime patrol aircraft after it was forced to return the lend-lease B-24 Liberator bombers it received during wartime. A stopgap solution in the form of a modified version of the Lancaster bomber was created, but the need for a dedicated maritime patrol aircraft became more and more emphasized in the postwar period.\n\nDevelopment of the Avro Shackleton began in 1945 after the British Air Staff expressed an interest in the conversion of the Avro Lincoln bomber into a general reconnaissance as well as rescue aircraft. As a result, the Avro Type 696 was designed. The Type 696 was primarily based on the Avro Lincoln bomber, but also borrowed some design solutions from the Avro Tudor airliner, of which the latter two themselves were derivative designs of the famous Avro Lancaster. The first prototype, designated Shackleton GR.1, successfully performed its maiden flight in March 1949 and was shortly afterwards ordered into production.\n\nThe Avro Shackleton entered service with the RAF in February 1951. The aircraft performed several roles, ranging from its primary role - maritime reconnaissance - over escort and transport duties to search and rescue, whilst being employed all across the globe. However, the aircraft saw numerous modifications during its lifetime, aimed at increasing its capabilities and addressing reliability and structural problems, although at the expense of added weight.  The Shackleton and its variants continued to serve throughout the Cold War era, and in the late '80s the Avro Shackleton was finally considered obsolete.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7309-development-avro-shackleton-mr-mk-2-the-flight-of-a-thousand-rivets-en|[Devblog] Avro Shackleton MR Mk.2: The Flight of A Thousand Rivets]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Avro}}\n{{Britain bombers}}"}}
