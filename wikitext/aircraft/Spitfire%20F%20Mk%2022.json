Try to maintain a speed of between 400-500 km/h IAS; this is where the plane maintains great agility, turnfighting below this velocity against planes such as the [[Bf 109 G-14]] is really not recommended. It is very important to avoid hard turning above 500 km/h IAS, because the plane may lose its wing.\n\nThe main task for a pilot is to utilize the great climb rate to gain an altitude advantage on enemy fighters (altitude allows you to control engagements). Target altitude should usually be around 5-6 km on smaller maps and 6-7 km on larger maps such as Norway and Spain. The main form of attack (especially when there are more fighters around the target) is Boom & Zoom. Energy fighting is an option too, if in a 1-vs-1 situation. The Griffon Spitfire is an excellent energy fighter, the Griffon engine provides a tremendous amount of horsepower which can be used to gain speed quickly and climb back at a safe altitude. Remember to maintain speed, altitude advantage, and judge the energy state before engaging an aircraft.\n\nWhen fighting propeller aircraft, you should use your superior engine power and flight characteristics to your advantage. Fighters should be engaged based on their individual strengths and weaknesses. When facing Soviet fighters it is not recommended to duel them below 4,000 m. Maintain altitude and energy and get your guns on target. Do not commit to head-on attacks and do not burn all your energy in a turnfight with a Bf 109 or a Japanese fighter, this Spitfire handles differently to the previous ones in the series.\n\n=== Specific enemies worth noting ===\n\n* Heavy bombers: they are best left to heavy fighters like the [[F-82E]] twin-mustang or the de Havilland Hornet due to their more potent, nose-mounted armament. If you must engage a bomber, you should engage from directly below or above, or in a head-on. Closing in from behind or the sides, you are exposing yourself to a barrage of heavy machineguns and autocannons which will shred your flimsy airframe. Most bombers only have a single defensive armament in the nose and above and below are typically gunner dead-zones or entirely unarmed. A two-engine bomber requires both to remain aloft, take one out and it will surely die. 4-engine bombers only need 2 or 3, so aiming for the engines is ill-advised. For these, you should take out the pilot or destroy the wing-tips to cause the bomber to fall into a flat spin. Alternatively, you can take out the tail controls to disable a bomber (this however requires a rearward engagement which is most dangerous).\n\n* Jet fighters: they are strong, though not infallible. German and Japanese jets tend to have horrific performance at altitudes exceeding 4,500 m. You can bait them up and energy trap them. Once they have lost their speed they are incredibly vulnerable due to their atrocious acceleration, which you can exploit and quickly gain on them. Soviet jets also suffer above about 5,000 m. They also have very little ammunition and low speeds. American jets are the biggest issue: your best bet is to bait them into turnfighting or losing their energy, where they are most vulnerable.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

When the first Rolls Royce Griffon equipped Spitfires were tested it was obvious that a stronger airframe would be needed to harness the full power of the new engine. Added to this was the requirement for a much stiffer wing; the result of these findings was the Spitfire Mk.21. The Mk.21 was also fitted with larger ailerons and the same 2050 hp Griffon 65 engine which was fitted to the Mk.XIV and Mk.XVIII. By this point in the aircraft's life, the Spitfire was so different from RJ Mitchell's original concept that the notion of renaming the new aircraft the 'Victor' was considered.\n\nThe Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Boscombe Down began to test the Mk.21 in late 1944, but were deeply unhappy with the new Spitfire and recommended that no further attempts were made to progress the basic Spitfire design. Chief amongst the AFDU's complaints was directional instability: Supermarine attempted to solve this problem by modifying the control surfaces. It was only with the introduction of a new, enlarged tailfin and tail plane which finally solved the instability problems.\n\nThe Mk.22 differed from the Mk.21 only in having a teardrop bubble canopy – a change which had not required a new mark number in previous Spitfires – and a different electrical system. The Mk.22, as with the Mk.21, was armed with four 20mm Hispano cannons. The Mk.22 was more prolific and more successful than the Mk.21, with some 280 aircraft being manufactured. It was used to equip No.73 Squadron and twelve squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. In 1955 the Spitfire Mk.22 was declared obsolete by the RAF and many were exported to South Rhodesia, Syria and Egypt.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=spitfire_f22 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|MNacjyimuCQ|'''The Shooting Range #95''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 05:10 discusses the Spitfire F Mk 22.|YrotBJk-VYk|'''The Shooting Range #124''' - ''War Machines'' section at 00:28 discusses the Griffons.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341991-supermarine-spitfire-f-mk-22/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
