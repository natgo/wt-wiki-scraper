It was introduced in [[Update 1.39]].\n\nThe Spitfire F Mk 24's Rolls-Royce Griffon engine is the fighter's greatest asset, but it is still very agile at medium speeds of around 400-500 km/h. When the Mk 24 cannot make use of its Griffon engine it is highly vulnerable, so pilots should take care to avoid situations where speed and acceleration is a non-factor in victory.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

The Offensive 20 mm upgrade is incredibly useful due to the power of the \"Air targets\" belt on Hispano Mk.II cannons, which is why it is prioritized over the Engine upgrades even with the focus on engine-related upgrades.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n[[File:FighterImage_Spitfire_F_Mk_24.jpg|thumbnail|right|The new wing shape and larger control surfaces of the 22/24 series are a distinctive feature of the aircraft.]]\nThe Spitfire F Mk 24 is an outstanding plane in realistic battles with few weaknesses, meaning the enemy will have a really hard time either catching the Mk 24 or shaking it off of their tail, and only the most skilled of opponents will stand a chance.\n\nIt is very important to monitor your energy state, as the Spitfire F Mk 24 is a relatively large fighter aircraft and will be a big target at low speeds.\n\nThe main task for a Mk 24 pilot is to utilize the immense power of the Rolls-Royce Griffon engine, which allows the Spitfire to climb at an insanely high rate. The pilot should always use his climb rate to his advantage in combat, using his altitude to dictate the terms of an engagement. Target altitude should usually be around 5-6 km on smaller maps and 6-7 km on larger maps such as Norway or Spain where the Griffon engine will perform optimally.\n\nThe Spitfire F Mk 24's main combat tactic is Boom & Zooming due to its outstanding speed, armament, and engine output. Because of the last point, Energy fighting is an option open to the Mk 24 as well, when engaging an enemy separated from his team. The Rolls-Royce Griffon engine is what opens the Spitfire F Mk 24 to both of these tactics. Not only does the Griffon engine bestow the Mk 24 with incredible top speed, but it also causes the fighter to accelerate incredibly fast allowing it to keep its speed for longer even in a sharp climb.\n\nAlthough boom-and-zooming and energy fighting are the main tactics of the Spitfire F Mk 24, the fighter is also able to keep up with most enemies in-turn fights with few exceptions (namely Japanese fighters). Try to maintain a speed of between 400-500 km/h; this is where the plane maintains a high turn rate. Turning below this velocity against planes such as the [[P-51H-5-NA]] is not recommended. It is important to note that the Mk 24 should avoid combat at low altitude especially versus Soviet fighters who excel below 4 km. The Mk 24's strength is at high altitude combat, where it can fully utilize the power of its Griffon engine.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The Mk.24 was the very last land based Spitfire of the long and illustrious line of fighters. It differed only from late production Spitfire Mk.22s in having two extra fuel tanks fitted in the rear fuselage and provisions for under wing rockets. Late versions of the Spitfire Mk.24 were also fitted with the short barrel Hispano Mk.V 20mm cannon. Only 54 Spitfire Mk.24s were built with a further 27 being converted from Mk.22 airframes.\n\nContra-rotating propellers were tested on the Mk.21, 22 and 24 Spitfires but were still not perfected in time to see service on this last Spitfire variant. The contra-rotating propeller would, however see front line service with the Fleet Air Arm's Seafire Mk.46 and Mk.47. The Spitfire Mk.24 entered service in 1946 with No.80 Squadron in Gutersloh, Germany; the squadron later moved to Hong Kong. In January 1952 the RAF's last front line Spitfire squadron handed its aircraft over to the Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force, ending a legacy of over 25 years of perhaps the most famous and iconic fighter aircraft in aviation history.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=spitfire_f24 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|MNacjyimuCQ|'''The Shooting Range #95''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 06:03 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|YrotBJk-VYk|'''The Shooting Range #124''' - ''War Machines'' section at 00:28 discusses the Griffon Spitfires.|Fjh-tTr6TPs|'''Best Combo #2'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:00  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|4v3fxupuZPA|'''Last piston fighters''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:29 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341992-supermarine-spitfire-fmk24/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
