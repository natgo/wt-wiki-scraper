It was introduced in [[Update 1.35]].\n\nBecause the muzzle velocity of both the Hispanos (870 m/s) and the MGs (854 m/s) is practically the same you could put tracers on the MGs and air targets belt on the Hispanos. This is a great way for players to get a feel of where to aim in RB and it's easier to hit your shots maximising your efficiency and potentially saving ammo. A downside to this is that the element of surprise is short lived as your enemy will see the tracers flying past him and he will quickly react. Another thing is that short bursts are required with the cannons especially without the cannon upgrades as they overheat (and thus jam) very quickly.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAs a Spitfire Mk IX at its realistic mode battle rating, the most common and dangerous opponents are Bf 109s, normally the G-2/Trop and F-4 variants both of which often benefit from a better team composition on the axis side. When facing them, you should never attempt to hold an extended dogfight above 5,000 m as you will lose a significant portion of engine power in comparison to them. Instead, you should take the fight below 5 km where you can outrun a Bf 109 F-4, although Fw 190s and the German variant P-47 will catch up easily at the lower altitude.\n\nThe advantages of your plane in both an up-tier and down-tier remain largely the same in that you can out-turn almost anything except all models of the A6M \"Zero\" and the A7M \"Reppu\" along with earlier Spitfires you might face such as the Italian Spitfire Mk Vb/Trop. In this scenario you should play cautiously and try to energy fight them, extending away and climbing. For head-ons, since the armament of 2 x 20 mm and 4 x 7.7 mm machine guns are rather lacklustre, you usually should avoid these. If you really want to, though, use stealth rounds and fire from 1,000 to 1,400 metres away from the target while using a 500 m convergence. However, this Spitfire does best at mid-close ranges (200-600 metres) with either 400 m or 300 m convergence. The wing-mounted guns aren't really good for head-ons.\n\nAnother aspect to consider and adjust your playstyle to is that while the acceleration and turn time is good, engine overheating in RB and SB should be managed using manual engine controls and pulling more than 9 G while rolling puts you at risk of ripping your wing off. Additionally, since the Inline engine is very vulnerable to damage and the Spitfire requires lots of time on target, practice proper methods of attacking bombers using boom and zoom tactics as tail-sitting enemy bombers with decent defensive armaments like the Me 264 and the He 177 is not likely to end well at all.\n\nIn ground RB, the lacklustre suspended armament suggests that it is unadvised to engage ground targets. The 250 lb bomb may be worth taking to play your chances against a light tank or SPAA but extreme luck and skill is required to get a kill as extreme accuracy is required with the bomb. The offensive armament also lacks penetration and cannot be relied upon to kill ground vehicles - even SPAAs like the [[Ostwind]], [[Wirbelwind]] and [[M16 MGMC]] will prevail against your 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

While the Mk VII and Mk VIII variants was being designed, a Spitfire Mk III was tested in September 1941 with the new Rolls Royce 60 in the hopes of developing an interim fighter to use as a stop gap measure. The new Spitfire performed exceptionally well, and was rushed into production as the Mk IX. The Air Fighting Development Unit described the Mk IX as 'outstandingly better than the Mk V especially at heights above 20,000 feet' and even though it was not fitted with the modified control surfaces under development for the Mk VII and Mk VIII, the Mk IX was more than capable of meeting the Focke-Wulf FW190 on favourable terms. The Mk IX was fitted with the Type C 'universal' wing and originally carried the tried and tested combination of two 20 mm cannon and four 0.303 inch machine guns, but in later versions the four 0.303 machine guns were replaced with two .50 calibre guns.\n\nA total of 5,665 Mk IX were produced and 262 more Mk Vs were converted to Mk IX. Intended as a transitional stop-gap measure for the Mk VII and Mk VIII, the variant remained in production until the end of the war, ultimately becoming the most mass-produced Spitfire version. This mark was also used as a fighter-bomber and as a reconnaissance aircraft. Further modifications were incorporated into the Mk IX throughout its service life, such as a gyroscopic gunsight, bubble canopy and modified engine intercooler. Widely considered to be the most capable fighter in the world at the time of its introduction, it would take the introduction of the Rolls Royce Griffon engine to push the Spitfire into its next stage of evolution.\n\n=== Notable pilots ===\n[[File:Douglas_Bader_profile.jpg|thumb|none|220px|User:U64962917#Bader,_Douglas_R.S.B.|The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' was the fighter in which '''[[User:U64962917#Bader,_Douglas_R.S.B.|Douglas Bader]]''' flew as flight lead of 300 aircraft over London for a victory flyover in June 1945.]]\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=spitfire_ix_early Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|9_txEPailKc|'''The Shooting Range #92''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 05:10 discusses the Spitfire F Mk IX.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other Spitfire Mk IX variants:\n\n* [[Spitfire F Mk IXc]]\n* [[Spitfire LF Mk IX]]\n* [[Plagis' Spitfire LF Mk IXc]]\n* [[Spitfire Mk IXc (USSR)]]\n* [[Spitfire LF Mk IXc (USA)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/162149-supermarine-spitfire-f-mk-ix/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
