The Spitfire Mk IX was hastily developed as a temporary response to the Focke-Wulf 190 while production of the improved Spitfire Mk VIII airframe was ramping up. Early models of the Spitfire Mk IX were equipped with what was known as the \"c\" wing. The \"c\" wing was designed to decrease production cost and time when compared to the \"a\" and \"b\" wings while allowing for use of universal armament installation giving it the nomenclature of the universal wing. The \"c\" wing was capable of equipping 8 Browning .303 machine guns, 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons and 4 Browning .303 machine guns, or 4 Hispano 20 mm autocannons. The most common configuration was that of 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons and Browning .303 machine guns as equipping the wing with 4 Hispano 20 mm autocannons resulted in technical problems which could cause the guns to malfunction at high altitude.<ref>The Spitfire Site (2010, April 15). ''The Hispano Cannon''. http://spitfiresite.com/2010/04/spitfire-the-hispano-cannon.html</ref> Later models of Mk IX were equipped with the \"e\" type wing which was a slightly improved version of the \"c\" type that allowed for the installation of 2 Browning .50 calibre machine guns and 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=spitfire_mk9c_4cannons Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"200\">\nFile:Glamorous Spitfire .png|<small>The {{PAGENAME}} holds a good mix of turning abilities and engine power.</small>\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/406695-spitfire-fmk-ixc-4c/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
