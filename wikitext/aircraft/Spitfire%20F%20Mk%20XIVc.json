Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nWhile it does have the older wing and body type of pre-Griffon Spitfires, this aircraft takes the best of both worlds and becomes a monster at its rank. Utilizing the powerful Griffon engine, this plane has amazing acceleration and climb rate, even better than the Merlin variants. This aircraft does not compromise on manoeuvrability as it can still turn on a dime. Beware of the brittle wing construction as taking hard G turns at 600 km/h and beyond can break its wings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 8,537 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Primarily a fighter, this plane excels at catching unsuspecting pilots still climbing to altitude and amazing at the spitfire trademark of dogfighting.\n\n==== Tactics ====\nThis aircraft has an ideal operating altitude of between 4,000 m - 6,000 m due to the properties of the Griffon engine, but this aircraft has no problems climbing past that altitude, though manoeuvrability is slightly compromised at altitudes higher than 7,000 m. This aircraft excels at energy dogfighting, a mix between energy fighting and dogfighting. The insanely good acceleration coupled with the great climb rate and energy retention allows this aircraft to excel in horizontal dog-fighting as well as vertical energy manoeuvres. Don't get into extended energy fights as many pure energy fighters can outdo this aircraft in pure energy fights.\n\n==== Specific enemies worth noting ====\nAmerican aircraft can really outdo this plane in speed and energy retention, but cannot dogfight this plane very well. German planes are even more dangerous due to their high top speed and energy retention. This plane can adequately fight Japanese aircraft, but Zeroes can turn faster than you can, though they don't accelerate in a straight line as fast. If you stay up above 4,000 m, you can deal with most Soviet aircraft effectively.\n\n==== Counter-tactics ====\nBooming and zooming and pure energy fights are this plane's weaknesses, it does not hold up well in drawn-out fights of speed.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In 1941 the Spitfire Mk.IV was the first Spitfire to be trialed with the new Rolls Royce Griffon engine. By the time the Griffon Spitfire entered service with the RAF in February 1943, subsequent modifications had redesignated the aircraft as the Spitfire Mk.XII. As successful as this new Spitfire was at low altitudes, the Mk.XII's performance was actually inferior to the Merlin engine Mk.IX at medium and high altitudes.\n\nThus, the Spitfire Mk.XIV entered service as an interim fix. Fitted with a Rolls Royce Griffon 65 with two-stage supercharger producing 2050 hp, the Mk.XIV immediately corrected many of the performance shortcomings suffered by the Mk.XII. The fuselage was strengthened to harness the powerful engine and a five bladed Rotol propeller replaced the earlier four bladed examples. Early models were fitted with the Type C wing although later Mk.XIVs were equipped with the Type E wing housing two 20mm Hispano cannons and two .50 caliber Browning machine guns or four 20mm cannons, as well as a high visibility teardrop canopy. A common modification to the Mk.XIV was the clipped wing, which increased roll rate and gave a marginal increase to speed, but at the most of rate of climb.\n\nThe Spitfire Mk.XIV entered service with Nos. 91, 322 and 610 Squadrons in southeast England where it saw notable success as an interceptor against V-1 Flying Bombs but also as part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force in operations over occupied Europe. Spitfire Mk.XIVs were also planned for use in the Far East but whilst a number of airframes were shipped to Burma, none were operational before the end of the war. The Spitfire Mk.XIV met mixed reviews from its pilots; whilst there was no doubt of the huge performance increase the new variant offered, it was uncomfortable to fly and lacked the balance and control harmonization of earlier Merlin engine Spitfires. Just under 1000 Spitfire Mk.XIVs were produced with exports being employed by the Air Forces of India, Belgium and Thailand.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=spitfire_mk14c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|MNacjyimuCQ|'''The Shooting Range #95''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 02:55 discusses the Spitfire F Mk XIVc.|YrotBJk-VYk|'''The Shooting Range #124''' - ''War Machines'' section at 00:28 discusses the Griffons.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341987-supermarine-spitfire-fmkxivc/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
