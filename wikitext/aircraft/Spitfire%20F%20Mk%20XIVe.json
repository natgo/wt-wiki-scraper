If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB). -->\nThe Spitfire F Mk XIVe, being outfitted with a Griffon engine, does not have as stellar of a climb rate as its Merlin engine counterparts. However, it still does have a very competitive rate of climb, and can usually come out above all but a few opponents. With such an altitude advantage, the pilot is able to choose which engagements to pursue, and the ability to choose engagements wisely is necessary. Since dogfighting in the Spitfire can involve prolonged turn-fights, make sure that no other enemies are nearby, or that if there are, that they can be dealt with by teammates. This plane's engines gives it great acceleration, and it also accelerates well in dives. Be careful though, since at very high speeds, sharp manoeuvres may cause the wings to snap.\n\nAs far as manoeuvrability goes, the Spitfire is still very good at turning, especially at high altitudes. It also has a good roll rate, making rolling scissors manoeuvres a viable tactic in dogfights.\n\nWith these flight characteristics, the Spitfire is a sort of jack of all trades. It can turnfight well, of course, but it can also boom and zoom or energy fight with much success. However, the plane does have some drawbacks. For one, the powerful engine is prone to overheating, so throttle and WEP management may be necessary. Additionally, performance at low altitudes can be inadequate in certain situations. Finally, the only ordnance that the plane can carry is a single 500 lb bomb. While this can certainly destroy an enemy tank in ground realistic battles, precise aim is required to do so consistently, and the one bomb is the only anti-tank weapon that the plane has. Still, it excels in an anti-fighter role in ground RB; its excellent manoeuvrability is well suited for the gamemode's tendency to involve one on one dogfights.\n\nThe Spitfire F Mk XIVe carries a fairly standard ammunition count: not particularly high and not very low. It's possible to spray a little bit, but it is also wise to keep an eye on your ammo count, and to preserve ammunition if possible.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In 1941 the Spitfire Mk.IV was the first Spitfire to be trialed with the new Rolls Royce Griffon engine. By the time the Griffon Spitfire entered service with the RAF in February 1943, subsequent modifications had redesignated the aircraft as the Spitfire Mk.XII. As successful as this new Spitfire was at low altitudes, the Mk.XII's performance was actually inferior to the Merlin engine Mk.IX at medium and high altitudes. Thus, the Spitfire Mk.XIV entered service as an interim fix. Fitted with a Rolls Royce Griffon 65 with two-stage supercharger producing 2,050 hp, the Mk.XIV immediately corrected many of the performance shortcomings suffered by the Mk.XII. The fuselage was strengthened to harness the powerful engine and a five bladed Rotol propeller replaced the earlier four bladed examples. Early models were fitted with the Type C wing although later Mk.XIVs were equipped with the Type E wing housing two 20 mm Hispano cannons and two .50 caliber Browning machine guns or four 20 mm cannons, as well as a high visibility teardrop canopy. A common modification to the Mk.XIV was the clipped wing, which increased roll rate and gave a marginal increase to speed, but at the most of rate of climb.\n\nThe Spitfire Mk.XIV entered service with Nos. 91, 322 and 610 Squadrons in southeast England where it saw notable success as an interceptor against V-1 Flying Bombs but also as part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force in operations over occupied Europe. Spitfire Mk.XIVs were also planned for use in the Far East but whilst a number of airframes were shipped to Burma, none were operational before the end of the war. The Spitfire Mk.XIV met mixed reviews from its pilots; whilst there was no doubt of the huge performance increase the new variant offered, it was uncomfortable to fly and lacked the balance and control harmonization of earlier Merlin engine Spitfires. Just under 1,000 Spitfire Mk.XIVs were produced with exports being employed by the Air Forces of India, Belgium and Thailand.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=spitfire_mk14e Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|YrotBJk-VYk|'''The Shooting Range #124''' - ''War Machines'' section at 00:28 discusses the Griffons.|MNacjyimuCQ|'''The Shooting Range #95''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 03:42 discusses the Spitfire F Mk XIVe.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341988-supermarine-spitfire-fmkxive/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
