If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAll Spitfire versions served primarily as fighter aircraft. Due to its high manoeuvrability, the Spitfire LF Mk IXc excels in dogfighting, matched only by a few opponents (mainly Japanese). Due to its vulnerabilities, namely its low ammunition load and somewhat flimsy airframe, it is not recommended to attack bombers with heavy defensive armament. Its climb rate is one of the Spitfire's greatest advantages, being able to outclimb many rivals at its rank. Despite this, it is not recommended to try to catch up with zoom-climbing enemy fighters, because the Spitfire will most likely run out of speed before you manage to engage the opponent. Therefore, go into a shallow but high-speed climb to patiently gain the same altitude as the foe. Do not waste too much speed or altitude to the Boom & Zoom bounce from above, or else it will not work. In emergency situations, when an opponent is diving onto you, your speed is insufficient to face them and, when there are no clouds to hide in, you can descend to the tree-top level and use sharp turns and preferably uneven terrain to make dive attacks impossible for your opponent. He will most likely have to pull up before he can attack, due to his high speed. Exactly at that moment when he is pulling up, you can take initiative.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The Americans used Spitfires, as well..\n\nThe beginning of the Spitfire was marked by volunteers who had joined the ranks of the British RAF before the USA joined the war. In 1941, there were three full-fledged American fighter squadrons in Britain, named the Eagles. The Americans originally flew Hurricanes, but in August 1941 they started their retraining on Spitfires. Until the autumn of 1942, the Eagles were common British squadrons with the corresponding staff, uniforms, and markings. On September 29, 1942, thanks to an intergovernmental agreement, the Eagles were transferred to the command of the Eighth Air Force of the USAAF, located in Great Britain. Three squadrons were combined to form the 4th Fighter Wing, and the tricolour British cockades on the planes were replaced with American ones.\n\nBeginning in 1942, a number of the USAAF's fighter units which had arrived at the West European theatre of war without planes received British fighters as part of the so-called \"Reverse Lend-Lease\". These squadrons were originally based in Great Britain. Later, they were also based in North Africa. A total of about 1,000 Spitfires of various versions were handed over to the USAAF by the RAF.\n\nFor example, the 52d Fighter Wing was redeployed in July 1942 from the USA over the ocean to Northern Ireland. It was there that American fighter pilots had to master the Spitfire. The Americans flew Spitfires when they joined the North African Campaign in November 1942. American pilots fought in Spitfires in the North African theatre of war until the German troops were defeated in May 1943.\n\nThe Americans used Spitfires (Mk.VIII and Mk.IX variants) in the skies over Italy as part of the Twelfth Air Force. By March 1944, the majority of the British planes had been replaced with Mustangs, but there were still some planes with those white stars on their fuselages all the way up until the Capitulation of Germany.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=spitfire_ix_usa Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|AtuFtliw3Bo|'''Premium Review: US Spitfire LF.
