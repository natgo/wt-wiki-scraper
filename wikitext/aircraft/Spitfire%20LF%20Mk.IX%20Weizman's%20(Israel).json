It has an astounding climb rate with a decent armament and still maintains that superb turn time that spitfires are known for. Because it is a low altitude variant, it is wise to stay below 5,000 m to get the best performance possible. Remember to use your supercharger when above 2,000 m: it will grant you a significant performance increase. Climbing is a valid strategy when you first spawn in because of your amazing climb rate. You are nearly guaranteed a height advantage over everyone. Maintain your altitude and lure enemies into a turn fight as there isn't anyone at your battle rating that can outturn you, the exception being a couple Japanese planes. Although this plane is a good turnfighter, exploiting your turn rate too much can lead to bleed a lot of energy and become an easy target for other planes. This plane is reasonably fast but for sure not the fastest at its rating. Do not head on with this plane. The 20 mm Hispano cannons are inaccurate, and jam quickly, even when fully upgraded. Instead, dodge and start a turn fight where the Spitfire will almost always come out on top.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The first planes purchased were Czechoslovakian Avia S-199s - a partially-improvised version of the Bf 109 - but these proved to be inferior to Egyptian Air Force Spitfires. Simultaneously, Israel began acquiring its own Spitfires (primarily surplus planes previously given to Czechoslovakia by Britain) in a series of politically - and functionally - complex operations. By the end of the war, most combat aircraft in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) were Spitfires of whatever models could be acquired.\n\nThe Black Spitfire originally arrived in Israel in November 1949 (months after the official end of the war), and initially bore the number 2057. It served in the 101 fighter squadron. By this time, Spitfires were only used as bomber escorts and for reconnaissance flights. Most Israeli Spitfires were eventually sold to Burma in 1954; however, Ezer Weizman - then commander of the Ramat David air force base - argued to keep several of the aircraft in Israel. He ordered one of those aircraft, including number 2057, to be painted black, to match the colour scheme used by his former British airbase commander in Rhodesia during World War II, when Weizman trained as a pilot in the RAF. The plane was renumbered to \"57\".\n\nWeizman kept the aircraft for training purposes in the IAF, but it was unofficially understood to be his own personal plane. Weizman later became Commander of the IAF and eventually retired, but nevertheless kept flying the plane during multiple IAF air parades over the following decades. The plane became famous in Israel as \"Weizman's Black Spit\", and was closely associated with the man. Weizman went on to become a member of the Israeli parliament, its Minister of Defense, and finally the President of the State of Israel. During his funeral in 2005 the Black Spit was flown over the burial ceremony.\n\nThe Black Spit is one of about 60 Spitfires that are still operational today. When not undergoing maintenance, it is occasionally kept on public display at the IAF Museum near Be'er Sheva.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=spitfire_lf_mk9e_weisman Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|mF0d3bos75I|'''The Shooting Range #281''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:26 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other late Merlin-engine LF variant Spitfires\n\n* [[Spitfire LF Mk IXc (USA)]]\n* [[Spitfire LF Mk IX]]\n* [[Plagis' Spitfire LF Mk IXc]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7383-development-israel-a-new-gaming-nation-coming-to-war-thunder-en|[Devblog] Israel, a new gaming nation coming to War Thunder!]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Israel fighters}}\n{{Israel premium aircraft}}"}}
