It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nIt was made available for purchase in-game with Golden Eagles {{ge}} briefly [[wt:en/news/534--en|after the release of Update 1.39]], then in [[wt:en/news/2603--en|November 2014]], then during the [[wt:en/news/4554-event-spitfire-day-in-honor-of-the-first-flight-en|2017 \"Spitfire Day\"]] mini-event, then during the [[wt:en/news/4969-video-event-legends-spitfire-and-tournaments-royal-joust-en|2017 \"Royal joust\"]] mini-event and in [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/551755-spitfire-mk-ixc-ussr-available-for-ge-for-limited-time/ April 2022].

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->\nLike most Spitfires, the {{PAGENAME}}'s strength lies in its rate of climb and turn rate.\n\nGenerally use the 20 minute charge in Air Realistic Battles, since the engine usually consumes enough when using the emergency power. Climb at between 20 and 25 degrees.\n\nThe biggest threats you will have will be other Spitfires, which there will be many considering that a possible opponent nation the {{PAGENAME}} can fight is Great Britain, as well as premium variants in America and Israel tech tree (though the latter also has two normal versions as well). Another nation to be cautious around is Japan, which have fighters like the Ki-84, N1K, and J2M that could take on a Spitfire pilot.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!
