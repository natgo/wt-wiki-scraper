In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27, originally under the name ''Spitfire Mk Vc'', however this was changed in [[Update 1.77 \"Advancing Storm\"]] to the current name when [[Update 1.77 \"Advancing Storm\"#Britain 2|non-tropical versions of Spitfire]] were introduced.\n\nThe Spitfire Vc/trop is a plane with two major advantages over its opposition: turn performance, engine performance below 3,000 m, and armament. The plane is blessed with a Merlin 45M engine that grants it phenomenal acceleration below that altitude compared to German opposition, as well as a hard-hitting armament of four Hispano Mark II cannons that gives it an exceptionally high burst mass of 5.17 kg/s- putting it on the same level as the [[Fw 190 A-5]].\n\nDue to its BR of {{Specs|br|rb}} in realistic battles, the Vc/trop will be matched against planes such as the [[Bf 109 G-2/trop]], which performs better in the vertical (climbing/diving), or the [[A6M5]], which performs better in the horizontal (turning). In an uptier battle - which is an odd-to-regular occurrence depending on whether players are playing more of rank III or IV aircraft - this aircraft faces opposition such as the [[Fw 190 A-8]], the [[Fw 190 C]], the [[Bf 109 G-6]] the [[A7M1 (NK9H)]], and even the [[Re.2005 serie 0]].\n\nIn Arcade battles, where it has a BR of{{Specs|br|ab}}, it will be put with far superior planes such as the [[Fw 190 D-9]] and [[Spitfire F Mk 22]].\n\nWhile this aircraft faces tricky opposition, it is far from helpless as one might come to expect from an aircraft with the airframe of a BR 3.3 aircraft at a higher BR. If used correctly, this aircraft can easily ruin the day of any axis pilot.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Spitfire Mk Vc/trop's engine performs best at low altitudes: between the 2,000 m and 3,500 m. At these low levels, the Spitfire has a competitive top speed, and a decent climb rate. Above this altitude, engine performance begins to suffer dramatically, as acceleration and climb rate decrease. The engine's power output can be maximized by using WEP, without which the plane lacks much of its performance. The Spitfire's acceleration in a dive is less than that of the Bf 109 and Fw 190.\n\nLike all Spitfires, the Vc/trop has above-average manoeuvrability, including a good turn rate and competitive roll rate. It also has decent energy retention both in flat turns and vertical manoeuvres. Watch out though, Fw 190s still have better energy retention and roll rate than the Spitfire, and A6Ms can out-roll it on low speeds.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 3,963 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Pilots should only really need the first or second cannon upgrade. The 1943 cannons are useful to have, but not strictly necessary to perform well in this aircraft.\n\nPriorities, in order, are:\n\n# Offensive 20 mm belts\n# Radiator\n# Compressor\n# New 20 mm cannons\n# Engine\n# Mk.II year 1942\n# Engine injection\n# Cover\n# Wings repair\n# Airframe\n# Fuselage repair\n# Mk.

Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Hispano Mk.II (20 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 4 x 20 mm Hispano Mk.II cannons, wing-mounted (120 rpg = 480 total)\n\nThe Spitfire Mk. Vc/trop is armed with four Hispano Mk.II cannons with 120 rounds per gun. While this is double the cannon capacity of earlier Spitfires, such as the [[Spitfire Mk Vb/trop]], it is still quite small, and unsuitable for firing long bursts at the enemy.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Spitfire Mark Vc/trop, unlike the older [[Spitfire Mk IIb|Mk IIb]] variant, no longer has overwhelming edges in performance over its opposition. This aircraft is heavier than its predecessors, and has an engine that does better at an altitude range that is much lower than its predecessors. The Spitfire Mk Vc/trop flies best at altitudes between the 2,000 m and 3,500 m range and its engine starts to suffer above this altitude. This plane must be played radically differently in terms of when and where to pick fights. As usual, the 7 P's of Combat apply: ''Proper Perusal, Planning and Preparation Prevent Poor Performance.''\n\nWith previous Spitfires, in order to use your plane most effectively, these were more or less suggestions. Flat-turning allowed you to take down enemies relatively consistently even without advanced knowledge. With this Spitfire, and arguably the [[Spitfire Mk Vb]] before it, it is absolutely essential to follow these. Without fulfilling these criteria, you will not be able to succeed with flying the Spitfire Vc/trop.\n\nYou need to know your opposition inside-out, but also your own plane's performance (Perusal). In order to fight, you need to plan your every move well and have a good idea of how you're going to start your match and at what point you're going to return to base (Planning). You need to know and be prepared to fight enemies that may have better performance than you in a turn, in the vertical, in a straight line, or all three (Preparation).\n\nThe ability of a pilot to fight using this plane is determined primarily by their skill and ability to pick their fights against their enemy wisely. Charging head-on into Axis teams, which usually will have an energy advantage over you, will result in the Spitfire's instant and explosive demise at the hands of [[Bf 109 G-2/trop|Bf 109G-2s]] and [[C.205 serie 3|C.205s]] eager to score an easy victory on an allied fighter at a lesser altitude and travelling at a lower speed while within their favoured altitude range (4,000-5,500 m).\n\nGeneral guides for fighting against major nations:\n\n* Germany and Italy: fighters of both those nations are well armed and have decent survivability, have better max speed than Spit and similar or slightly lower rate of climb. If you are below them, better run away far enough to be unworthy of their attention. If enemy attacks you on high altitude, your best chance is to dive and try to outmaneouvre them but do not attempt to fly in a straight line.\n* Japan: you wont stand a chance both in dogfight and flight speed so you should avoid fight against this nation when you are alone but if it is impossible, your best chance is in head-on as just a single shell stands high chance of setting enemy ablaze.\n* USA: American fighters have decent guns that will shred your plane during a head-on and are durable enough to resist a few hits with 20 mm guns. Fortunately those planes are relatively heavy and lack climb rate so you should be able to gather more potential energy before the duel begins. Once into dogfight, it wont take you more than 2 circles to get a stable position on enemy tail but same as with German and Italian planes, you should not allow them to run away.\n* USSR: it is very risky to be in front of a Soviet fighter even for a single moment due to their armament which might consist on 37 or even 45 mm guns that are able to destroy your plane with a single hit but generally you should proceed similarly to fights with German planes .\n\nLet's just mention that fighting bombers might be a very bad idea unless you are trying to take them from their side and have much speed.\n\nOne way to use this fighter to its best advantage is to use it as a \"Vulture\". Climb to 3,500 m and then proceed to roam around the map looking for aircraft low and slow, or for furballs where an enemy aircraft is pursuing a friendly. Dive on these people and \"Bounce\" them, shooting and entering a furball with them. These tactics will yield great success, provided that you are not chased yourself in turn.\n\nOne important thing to note is that this aircraft, especially while stock, cannot fire its weapons in long bursts. While stock, it will result in quick weapon jamming, and even when upgraded, its ammo capacity is absolutely abysmal. Furthermore, stock Hispanos Mk. II lack accuracy at bigger distances and when placed in wings, it gets even worse, so you shouldn't use them with aiming distances above 600 m. On low distances around 400-500 m with suitable aiming distance, enemy plane can be destroyed with just a single salvo (even without killing the pilot). Spitfire is also able to effectively fight tanks in ground RB. When attacking from above it is able to penetrate most medium tanks and SPGs with AP rounds but in such a situation you should use pretty low aiming distance of around 300 m.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nA single-seat, single-engine all-metal monoplane fighter, this variant of the Spitfire Mk V was fitted with the new Type C \"universal\" wing, capable of being fitted with a variety of armaments. The Mk VC could be fitted with four 20mm Hispano cannons, or it could carry two 20mm Hispano cannons and four 0.303 inch Colt-Browning Mk II machine guns. The cannons in the type C wings had a tape supply and so could carry up to 120 rounds per gun, unlike the type B wings, which were limited to 60 rounds. In addition, the Mk VC had other modifications to the airframe such as a strengthened fuselage, more armor, larger oil cooler and a new windscreen design.\n\nProduction of the Mk VC variant began in October of 1941, with the first aircraft being equipped with a Rolls Royce Merlin 45 or 46. However, with the appearance of the German Focke-Wulf FW190 fighter, Spitfire pilots found themselves being outmanoeuvred at low and medium altitudes.\n\nThe Mk VC was then fitted with Merlin 50, 50A, 55, and 56 engines. To improve performance characteristics at low and medium altitudes, some of these engines were fitted with a cropped supercharger impeller to allow maximum power to be reached at lower altitudes. Engines designed this way included the 45M, 50M, and 55M.\n\nOn the lower altitude models, further changes were implemented. To reduce drag and moment of inertia on the aircraft's longitudinal axis, the wingspan was reduced and the elliptical wingtips were redesigned to be nearly rectangular. Fighters designed with low-altitude combat in mind were designated Spitfire LFMk Vs (Low Flight). Aircraft optimized for mid-altitude combat were designated Spitfire FMk Vs (Flight) and fighters fitted with the Merlin 46, 50A, or 56 were designated Spitfire HFMk Vs (High Flight) and had an increased wingspan with elongated, elliptical wingtips.\n\nThe Spitfire VC fought in all theatres in which the RAF was active from 1941 to 1944. A total of some 6,500 Spitfire Mk V fighters were produced, of which 2,467 were Mk VCs.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=spitfire_mk5c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|9_txEPailKc|'''The Shooting Range #92''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 04:21 discusses the Spitfire Mk Vc/trop.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5371-development-spitfire-mk-v-model-update-and-new-modifications-en|[Devblog<nowiki>]</nowiki> Spitfire Mk.V: model update and new modifications]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/287254-supermarine-spitfire-mk-vctrop/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
