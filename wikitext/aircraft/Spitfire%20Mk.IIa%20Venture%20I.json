These should be primarily used against aircraft but can also be used as last resort to attack light or non-armoured ground targets, usually with stealth or universal belts. The job should be left to dedicated gun platforms like the Hurricanes and the Hellcats.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Combat tactics\nThe Spitfire Mk.IIa Venture I is an excellent low to medium altitude dogfighter. Lacking a supercharger, it shouldn't be used at high altitudes. In Air RB, it's best to climb to around 3500-4000 meters (11,500-13,200 feet) where the Merlin XII engine performs optimally. After climbing, release WEP and reduce throttle to below 95% to cool the engine until you've found a target. When engaging opponents, diving should be carefully executed to avoid speeds of 450 KM/H (280 MP/H) or greater, where control surfaces begin to suddenly stiffen. In combat, the light airframe and powerful engine provides a respectable rate of climb and an incredibly tight turning circle, combined with its eight browning machine guns, it is capable of eliminating enemy targets in short, controlled bursts. Poor weapon management will deplete your 2,800 rounds of ammunition quickly because individually, the machine guns are not very powerful. Concentrate and aim for the engine, cockpit or wings where your bullets will be most efficient at destroying vital components, such as wing spars or control surfaces.\n\nDefensively, it's most susceptible to experienced Bf-109 pilots who know not to engage early model Spitfires in turning engagements. When forced in an energy fight or outnumbered, reduce the altitude of your opponents and fly towards your team. Use your roll rate and tight turning radius to avoid enemy fire whenever possible. The plane is capable shaking enemy fire due to its nimbleness. If no teammates are around, force the enemy to be low and slow, use your superior turn and roll-rate with flaps to get the edge. This includes against Japanese aircraft. Zeroes are the only contemporary capable of turning with this Spitfire, use your flaps and manage your engine throttle carefully, rolling scissors is an excellent manoeuvre to get the edge against light Japanese fighters.\n\nLanding the Spitfire Mk.IIa Venture I is easy, the plane doesn't like to give up speed easily, so roll 90 degrees left and right banking low and hard to reduce speed. Once around 200 KM/H (125 MP/H), deploy your landing gear to perform a fast landing. Flaps are unnecessary unless making an emergency landing.\n\n;Enemies worth noting\n* Zeroes: They can outmanoeuvre the Spitfire in a turnfight.\n* Bf 109: They can inflict tremendous damage if you don't watch out. They have quite good turning performance and their energy retention exceeds that of the Spitfire.\n* Heavy Bombers: Although the Spitfire Mk IIa is armed with 8 guns, they are only 7.7 mm in calibre. So, it can be difficult to destroy heavy fighters, attackers, and especially bombers. It is likely that long bursts will be necessary to destroy such targets, and that gives time for enemy turret gunners to shoot back. Luckily, most bombers at this tier are not defended by turrets from all angles. Try to plan attack runs so that you don't fly in the enemy's line of fire.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was a single-engine, all-metal, low-wing monoplane with retractable landing gear. Various modifications served as fighters, interceptors, high-altitude fighters, fighter-bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. A total of some 20,300 Spitfires of all types were built during the war, including two-seater trainers.\n\nIn the summer of 1939, an early Spitfire Mk I was fitted with the new Rolls Royce Merlin XII engine, which had a higher output of 1175 HP and was fitted with a Coffman engine starter instead of the previous Merlin's electrical starter system. This, combined with the Rotol variable pitch propeller which had been used on many Spitfire Mk Is would now form the powerplant of the new Spitfire Mk II, although some production models used the De Havilland propeller. The Mk II was some 6-7 mph faster than the later Spitfire Mk I, but still slower than the original Spitfires before a series of modifications increased the aircraft's weight. As with the Mk I, the Spitfire Mk II was produced with either eight machine guns as the Spitfire Mk IIA, or two 20mm cannon and four machine guns as the Mk IIb. The earlier problems with cannon fitted to the Mk IB had now been solved by introducing a belt feed system to the weapon to replace the earlier drum, turning the cannon on its side and fitting a blister on the wing to house the new mechanism.\n\n920 Spitfire Mk IIs entered service; 750 Mk IIA and 170 MK IIB, although fighters used in the air-sea rescue role were later designated Mk IIC. The Spitfire II quickly replaced the Spitfire I, with the older variant being relegated to use in Operational Training Units. By April 1941, RAF Fighter Command had completed re-equipping with the Mk II, although this too would soon be replaced by the Mk V.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=spitfiremkiia_ep Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|MxnIrWny-XU|'''Should You Buy The Spitfire Mk2A Venture?''' - ''Sako Sniper''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Spitfire (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/287255-supermarine-spitfire-mk-iia/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Supermarine}}\n{{Britain fighters}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
