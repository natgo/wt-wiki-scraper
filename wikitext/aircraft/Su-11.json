Its primary strength is the excellent acceleration, compared to contemporary jets. It has excellent energy retention (ER) and average to good manoeuvring energy retention (MER).\n\nIn general, the best tactic with the Su-11 is to play to its strengths, as with any vehicle; In the Su-11's case, particularly its acceleration and ER can be exploited. Take off from the airfield, and level out quickly. Don't bother gaining initial altitude, jet engines particularly early jet engines, accelerate better at sea level. Turn at least 30 degrees away from the center of the map, and build up speed. It is recommended to build up to about 725 km/h - 805 km/h (450 mph to 500 mph), then place the aircraft into a 20-30 degree zoom climb (steady-state climbing is possible in this aircraft, but like most early jets, zoom climbing is most efficient).\n\nThis will take the Su-11 well above 3.5 km, usually closer to 5 km. Dive on unsuspecting enemies, particularly aircraft that don't manoeuvre well, and once they are destroyed, begin a 20-30 degree zoom climb to regain your lost altitude. The energy retention is excellent, and you can typically regain all your lost altitude, if not gain on top of it. Usually enemies on the Su-11 tail can be out-accelerated, which causes most players to lose interest in engaging and break off the chase, even if their aircraft's top speed is higher than the Su-11.\n\nManoeuvrability is average, but certainly not poor. The Su-11's manoeuvring energy retention is excellent, If forced to dogfight and the opponent vehicle has similar manoeuvrability, simply drain them of their energy with long, sweeping movements.\n\nWhile the Su-11's armament packs a punch, excellent marksmanship is an absolute necessity, given the low ammo pool of only 200 23 mm rounds and 40 37 mm rounds. In addition it has a relatively low rate of fire (on both cannons). The rounds are also relatively low velocity (especially the 37 mm round). However, the rounds are extremely powerful, with the 37 mm round able to destroy heavy bombers with a couple of well placed hits, and the 23 mm round able to destroy lighter aircraft with 1-2 hits. The best option is to get as close as possible before opening fire to ensure that the enemy plane gets knocked out.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

After testing the Su-9 in the wind tunnel, it was found that engines mounted in the wings rather than underneath reduced drag and that the wingtips also needed a redesign. As such, the Su-11 received a completely redesigned wing and before completion it was also received the Lyulka TR-1 turbojet engines. The two engines produced 2,865 lbf of thrust each for 5930 lbf of thrust total.\n\nThe Su-11 first flew on 28 May 1947, demonstrating a maximum speed of 940 km/h at sea level. Unfortunately, the design had a bad longitudinal stability and even modifications to the wing engine nacelles did not solve the issue. Because of these issues, the Su-11 programme was cancelled and did not enter production.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=su-11 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|1nCwVACmDQw|'''The Shooting Range #247''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:25 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/521170-su-11/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Sukhoi}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}\n{{USSR premium aircraft}}"}}
