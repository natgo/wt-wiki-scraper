But the long wings and incredibly powerful M-82 engine gives it one of the best manoeuvring energy retentions at the battle rating, which combined with really good acceleration makes it feel worlds more nimble than other similar aircraft.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 5,850 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nSukhoi Su-2 Short-Range Bomber with M-82 Engine\n\nDevelopment of the Su-2 continued after the start of World War II. Special attention was given to improving the aircraft's combat characteristics. The production model had its electric trigger control upgraded, four ShKAS machine guns were once again mounted in the wings, and the LU (MV-2) lower turret, with a 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun and a 500-round magazine capacity, was restored. The MV-5m turret (modified, with a larger continuous belt) was used as an dorsal defensive weapon. The magazine capacity was increased to 1,000 rounds.\n\nClusters of KMB-Su-2 bomblets were introduced for this series, allowing the bomber to prepare more quickly and easily for departure and allowing bomb bay space to be used more efficiently.\n\nEight unguided RS-82 or RS-132 rockets could be suspended under the Su-2, four on guide rails under each wing, even if bombs were also carried. At maximum load, the aircraft could take off with up to 8 FAB-100 bombs in the bomb bay and 2 FAB-250 bombs under the wings. Protective armour for the crew was also increased, especially for the navigator.\n\nSo that the flight characteristics of the aircraft would not suffer, the final production model Su-2 used a Shvetsov M-82 fourteen-cylinder double-row radial air-cooled engine with a maximum take-off power of 1,700 hp.\n\nFrom the start of the war, the Su-2 was used on the front lines as a day bomber, a ground-attack aircraft, and a scout plane. Military units armed with the Su-2 fought in the Battle of Stalingrad in the autumn of 1942 and for the Kuban region in the spring of 1943.\n\nVirtually all pilots who flew the Su-2 spoke of it very fondly. According to them, it was an undemanding, reliable warrior of the skies. Many times the planes returned with bullet holes or even parts of fins or rudders missing, but the maintenance personnel were able to repair them and send them into battle again a few days later.\n\nOf those pilots who flew the Su-2 aircraft during World War II, 27 were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Mikhail P. Odintsov and Grigory F. Sivkov were awarded it twice.\n\nThe Su-2 bomber was used relatively little for a number of reasons. The Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack aircraft was coming into operation and became the most popular multi-purpose aircraft of the Air Forces of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. It replaced many functions of the Su-2 and was widely used in most military operations during the war.\n\nProduction of the Su-2 was discontinued in April 1942, and the plane had ceased to participate in combat units by the end of 1943. In all, 877 Su-2 aircraft were produced, including all variants.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=su-2_m82 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|UDvzWT2BSg4|'''The Shooting Range #28''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:22 discusses the Sukhoi Su-2.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Sukhoi}}\n{{USSR strike aircraft}}"}}
