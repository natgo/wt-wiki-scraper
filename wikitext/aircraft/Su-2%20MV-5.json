The M-88 retained the original design scheme (air-cooled, radial, 14-cylinder) and had a takeoff power capacity of 1,100 hp.\n\nHowever, unreliable operation caused serious problems. The M-88 was continually suffering from piston burnouts, shaking, and increased oil consumption. Oil splatters leaking from the engine would splash on the cabin's transparent bottom, under the navigator, making it more difficult to aim bombs. In addition, the decision to replace the plexiglass canopy with celluloid was a mistake, as the new material quickly lost its transparency, reducing visibility. Nevertheless, the crew did appreciate the warm, closed cabin.\n\nSome of the Su-2s were equipped with rockets. Instead of bombs under the wings, five unguided PC-82 or PC-132 rockets could be installed in each location.\n\nA new variant of the Su-2 was released in early 1941, featuring the M-88B engine. This modification improved the aircraft's performance. The oil cooler was moved to the midsection and the shape of the hood and suction pipe were changed. The plane's armament was somewhat reduced to facilitate construction. Instead of four ShKAS guns in the winds, two guns were installed, with 850 rounds of ammunition per gun. The bulky MB-5 tail turret was replaced with a TSS-1 turret, with a ShKas 7.62 mm machine gun and 900 rounds of ammunition. However, the turret suffered from a number of problems, including a limited angle of fire and difficulty firing when in an air stream. In the spring of 1941, 250 aircraft were produced with the TSS-1. Afterwards, the MB-5 was used. Bomb and rocket payloads remained unchanged.\n\nThe Red Army Air Force began to use the Su-2 in combat during the second half of 1940. By the beginning of World War II on June 22, 1941, 213 Su-2s were in service.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=su-2_mv5 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|UDvzWT2BSg4|'''The Shooting Range #28''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:22 discusses the Sukhoi Su-2.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Sukhoi}}\n{{USSR strike aircraft}}"}}
