In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Raining Fire\"]].\n\nThe Su-6 is a Soviet prototype attack aircraft built to replace the [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]]. This first prototype Su-6 lacked the rear gunner of the later production [[Su-6 (AM-42)]] and [[Su-6 (M-71F)]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nIf you have flown the [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]], the Su-6 is a very familiar experience, as it shares many of the IL-2's performance characteristics. The greatest improvement of the Su-6 compared to the IL-2 is a much-improved top speed of 491 km/h, almost 100 km/h faster than the ultimate IL-2 variants. Other than that, the aircraft has very similar characteristics to the IL-2: competitive instantaneous turn rate, subpar energy retention in sustained turns (particularly at higher speeds), moderately responsive control surfaces and a decent turn rate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 2,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nCompared to the [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]] and [[IL-10]], the Su-6 is much less survivable mainly due to a reduction in armour plating. The aircraft's armour is concentrated around the cockpit, with 12 mm of plating in the lower front and back, 6 mm of plating on the sides, and 65 mm of bulletproof glass in front of the cockpit. Unlike the IL-2 and IL-10, the Su-6's engine block is unarmoured, meaning that headons in this aircraft are extremely dangerous due to the risk of engine damage.\n\nThe Su-6's main fuel tank is located directly underneath the cockpit and is also covered by the cockpit armour; this fuel tank is also self-sealing and features a neutral gas fire suppression system. The oil cooling system is mounted between the engine and cockpit, but is unarmoured making it more susceptible to damage.\n\n* 6 mm steel behind propeller spinner\n* 6 mm steel under oil cooling systems\n* 6 mm steel on both sides of fuel tank\n* 6 mm steel on both sides of pilot\n* 8 mm steel above pilot's head\n* 12 mm steel in front of and behind fuel tank\n* 12 mm steel behind pilot\n* 65 mm bulletproof glass in front of pilot\n* Self-sealing fuel tanks (1 underneath pilot)\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.
