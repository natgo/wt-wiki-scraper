Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Su-7B is characterised by a low BR for a supersonic jet and amazing acceleration. With a 1-1 thrust-weight ratio when at optimal fuel load and spaded, it can reliably punch above its weight. The Sukhoi accelerates extremely well, outspeeding every supersonic at its BR except for MiG-21s. The manoeuvrability isn't bad, either - It can easily turn with supersonic aircraft such as MiG-21s, Harriers or A-7s. However, you must keep in mind that the plane has a tendency to break its wings if in a sustained 9+G turn at high speeds, and that you are not invulnerable while turning. You are giant, almost twice as big as a MiG-21, so be sure to not overstay your welcome in a dogfight and zoom away as soon as possible.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 11,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

A skilled pilot can easily get 3 to 4 kills with the 160 rounds of NR-30 ammo provided, but an unskilled pilot will have trouble hitting their shots. NR-30 cannons are (arguably) the best jet cannons one can have, and even a single hit can devastate an opponent.

Their first prototype was named '''S-1''' and was fitted with the all-new Lyulka AL-7 turbojet. It was the first Soviet aircraft to utilize the all-moving tailplane and a translating centerbody, plus a dramatic wing sweep of 60°, irreversible hydraulically boosted controls, and an ejection seat of Sukhoi's own design. After the success of the S-1, production began with the S-2. later renamed the '''Su-7'''.\n\nLater, on 31 July 1958, the Soviet Tactical Aviation tasked Sukhoi with developing a ground-attack variant of the Su-7, which could replace the scrapped Ilyushin [[IL-10 (Family)|IL-10]]. The resulting prototype, '''S-22''', incorporated structural refinements for high-speed, low-altitude operations. It first flew in March 1959 and entered service in 1961 as the '''Su-7B'''.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6738-development-su-7b-new-doctrine-en|Devblog]] ===\nWith the development of jet aviation, piston-engined attack aircraft quickly became an anachronism; a need arose for a new class of front-line aircraft - a fighter bomber. In the USSR, the MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighter jets were used to replace the piston-engined IL-10 to support the ground forces from the air, but it was quite obvious that a specialized machine was needed to fulfill the tasks of the fighter-bomber. The most suitable candidate was the Sukhoi Su-7 fighter jet, taken as the basis for the Su-7B fighter-bomber project. By the end of 1958, the first prototype was ready with the new AL-7F-1 engine. For almost two years, the aircraft underwent intensive testing and refinement, and in 1960 the new fighter-bomber went into mass production. Of the 431 planned, 344 Su-7Bs were built to equip up to 25 combat units. From the beginning of the 70's, the Su-7B aircraft began to be replaced with more modern modifications and models.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=su-7b Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Su-7B WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:Su-7B WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:Su-7B WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:Su-7B WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:Su-7B WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:Su-7B WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|S9qfGHj1YcI|'''The Shooting Range #211''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:28 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6738-development-su-7b-new-doctrine-en|[Devblog] Su-7B: new doctrine]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/488373-su-7b/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wt:en/news/6769-special-su-7b-military-pilot-interview-en|[Special] Su-7B military pilot interview]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Sukhoi}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
