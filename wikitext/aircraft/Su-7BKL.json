In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Raining Fire\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe Su-7BKL has the same flight performance as the [[Su-7B]], with excellent acceleration and climb rate, along with decent manoeuvrability. The biggest advantage of the Su-7BKL is its acceleration and top speed, with a TWR above 0.8 across most flight regimes and fuel loads. This means that the Su-7BKL out-accelerates almost every aircraft at its BR, with the exception of [[Harrier (Family)|Harriers]] at lower speeds. Top speed is just over Mach 1 at lower altitude, making the Su-7BKL faster than most aircraft it faces. Given its powerful engine, the Su-7BKL has an extremely impressive climb rate of almost 200 m/s. Given its acceleration, top speed and climb rate, few aircraft can keep up with the Su-7BKL in straight-line dashes.\n\nThe Su-7BKL's manoeuvrability performance is not as impressive. Its sustained turn rate at low speeds is competitive, but instantaneous turn rate and maximum angle-of-attack are both relatively low compared to its adversaries. This may make it more difficult to get guns on target. Additionally, some yaw instability occurs at medium speeds when pulling high-G turns. Finally, note that the Su-7BKL can break its wings in turns exceeding 9 G's, though this G-number isn't obtainable unless the aircraft is clean and carrying less than 20 minutes of fuel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 11,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* The pilot is protected by light aluminium plates and an armoured glass windscreen. These will not stop 20 mm AP frontally, but offer decent protection from the rear.\n* The engine is only protected by fuel tanks underneath. These can reduce the damage from shrapnel, but it is otherwise unprotected.\n* The flight control's cables go underneath the fuselage, and have a good chance to stay in one piece when hit.\n* The aircraft does not come with flares but has RWR. It will struggle against anything higher than its BR.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nIf you aim to play the Su-7BKL in ground battles, the first priority is to unlock the aircraft's anti-ground ordnance. The FAB-500 bombs and S-24 rockets are particularly helpful. Otherwise, focus on flight performance upgrades, starting with compressor, airframe, wings repair and engine. After those upgrades are researched and purchased, the other flight performance upgrades can be researched. The 30 mm ammunition belts can be researched last as the stock ammunition belts are quite potent.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!
