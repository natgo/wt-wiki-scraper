If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Arcade battles\n\nThe Su-7BMK can bomb bases, intercept bombers, and fight other fighter planes at the same time. With the awesome acceleration of the Su-7, you can easily catch up with the enemy, because of the massive and powerful engine with its afterburner. However, keep an eye on the fuel: the afterburner burns a ton of fuel when active, so the best would be to fill the fuel tank up to full. The plane also features a ballistic computer, and two 30 mm autocannons, with very good ammo selection, which can rip apart any plane you'll face in battle. The Su-7BMK can perform well in a 1-vs-1 scenario, but if it encounters multiple enemy planes, it will have problems (especially if your enemy is equipped with air-to-air missiles). The best would be to have a teammate close to you, so you will have some cover if things go wrong.\n\n;Realistic battles\n\nDogfighting is not the greatest idea because of the poor turn rate; the enemy can out-turn you easily, and get behind you. Also because of the low ammo capacity of the guns (160 rounds), you should apply trigger discipline. The two 30 mm autocannons are awesome, and easily destroy the most armoured planes at its rank. However, they consume ammo very fast if continuously fired. Overall, the Su-7BMK should remain an interceptor, and a base bomber. With its ballistic computer, you won't have a hard time hitting ground targets and bases.\n\n=== Radars ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | SRD-5 - Rangefinding radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The maximum range at which a target can be tracked}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The range below which targets cannot be tracked by the radar}}\n! {{Annotation|Azimuth Tracking<br/>Angle|How far to each side the radar can track a target}}\n! {{Annotation|Elevation Tracking<br/>Angle|How far up and down the radar can track a target}}\n|-\n| 3,000 m || 300 m || ±9° || ±9°\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The fighters were produced from 1967 to 1971 to more than 400 units and exported to Egypt, India, Algeria, North Korea, and Afghanistan. The Su-7BMK is identical to the Su-7BKL except for its landing gear, IFF system, and ballistic computer.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=su-7bmk Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Su-7 BMK WTWallpaper001.jpg|\nFile:Su-7 BMK WTWallpaper002.jpg|\nFile:Su-7 BMK WTWallpaper003.jpg|\nFile:Su-7 BMK WTWallpaper004.jpg|\nFile:Su-7 BMK WTWallpaper005.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7162-development-su-7bmk-from-russia-with-love-en|[Devblog] Su-7BMK: From Russia with Love]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/525888-su-7bmk/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Sukhoi}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}\n{{USSR premium aircraft}}"}}
