In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Winged Lions\"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VI, \"Firepower\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe flight performance of this plane is extremely sluggish, despite having a combined total of 4,000 horsepower, the plane still struggles to perform most manoeuvres. It has a poor turn radius, low lock-up speeds, and has a subpar climb rate compared to other aircraft at this BR. In mixed battles, the performance is made even worse with suspended ordnance options, which can up to 1,500 kg of additional weight. The plane does however have a silver lining, at low speeds, landing flaps can provide a very high amount of lift, which allows the plane to turn on a dime. The flaps can withstand speeds no more than 280 km/h (155 mph), but they can allow for the plane to make sharp turns to get into position to use the 45 mm cannons or establish a bomb line.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 7,150 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nThe Su-8 has copious amounts of armour, similar to other Russian strike aircraft such as the IL-2. This means the Su-8 can withstand incredible amounts of punishment, especially from machine gun fire. Dual engines allow the plane to return home if one is taken out, and pilot armour protects the pilot in any head-on engagement. The Su-8 should take every head-on engagement possible for this reason. In addition to pilot armour, the rear gunner also has good protection from the front and back of the aircraft.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\nThis is a premium aircraft, which means all modifications will be unlocked when this plane is obtained.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|NS-45 (45 mm)|ShKAS (7.62 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 4 x 45 mm NS-45 cannons, belly-mounted (50 rpg = 200 total)\n* 8 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, wing-mounted (600 rpg = 4,800 total)\n\nThe incredible NS-45 cannon seen on the [[Yak-9K]] is mounted on the Su-8. However instead of one cannon, the Su-8 wields four of these monstrous cannons. The armoured targets belt can penetrate the roof of every tank at the Su-8's BR, as well as the sides of many lightly-armoured vehicles. There is a price to pay for having such incredible armament. The recoil on these guns is extremely significant, it is recommended to fire in very short, controlled bursts. The recoil on this gun is effectively a stopping mechanism, as it can bleed so much speed when attacking a target, that you'll need to continuously adjust lead for every shot you fire. The gun velocity is pretty good, however it does not compare to the German MK 103 tank busting cannon, which has a much higher velocity. You'll need to calculate for gun drop when shooting at ground targets from a distance of more than a kilometre.\n\nThe smaller calibre ShKAS machine guns are also an important asset to this aircraft's success. They have an incredibly high rate of fire, and the Su-8 has eight of them. This is an incredible amount of bullets, and any soft AI target in Air Battles will be completely obliterated by a short burst. Once again, this incredible feature has a price to pay. The guns have a tendency to jam rather quickly, so short bursts are the key to success. The guns are also mounted very far away from the nose. Gun targeting needs to be set correctly in order for maximum effect, 500 m or so will be good for attacking ground units and spraying at pesky fighters.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|FAB-100sv (100 kg)|FAB-250sv (250 kg)|FAB-500sv (500 kg)}}\n{{main|M-8|M-13UK|RBS-82|RBS-132}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* Without load\n* 9 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (900 kg total)\n* 3 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (750 kg total)\n* 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (1,000 kg total)\n* 6 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs + 3 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (1,350 kg total)\n* 4 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs + 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (1,400 kg total)\n* 10 x M-8 rockets\n* 10 x M-8 rockets + 9 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (900 kg total)\n* 10 x M-8 rockets + 3 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (750 kg total)\n* 10 x M-8 rockets + 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (1,000 kg total)\n* 10 x RBS-82 rockets\n* 10 x RBS-82 rockets + 9 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (900 kg total)\n* 10 x RBS-82 rockets + 3 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (750 kg total)\n* 10 x RBS-82 rockets + 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (1,000 kg total)\n* 10 x M-13UK rockets\n* 10 x M-13UK rockets + 9 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (900 kg total)\n* 10 x M-13UK rockets + 3 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (750 kg total)\n* 6 x M-13UK rockets + 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (1,000 kg total)\n* 10 x RBS-132 rockets\n* 10 x RBS-132 rockets + 9 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (900 kg total)\n* 10 x RBS-132 rockets + 3 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (750 kg total)\n* 6 x RBS-132 rockets + 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (1,000 kg total)\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, dorsal turret (200 rpg)\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, ventral turret (200 rpg)\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics.

Coupled with a steady climb, it's a good choice for intercepting bombers\n* Landing flaps can significantly increase turn time\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Turn time is not on par with other aircraft at its BR. Feels sluggish and will lose energy fast\n* Compression issues at high speeds. It's best not to dive in this plane\n* Significant recoil when firing the NS 45, will cause a bleed in speed.\n* Guns mounted in the wings, necessary to set a convergence, but not all shells will hit\n* Guns jam incredibly fast, so short bursts are recommended\n* Very large target that is easy to hit\n* Gunner provides little protection against heavy fighters and other strike aircraft\n* No bombsight for mixed battles, a bombing run requires a skilled pilot\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
