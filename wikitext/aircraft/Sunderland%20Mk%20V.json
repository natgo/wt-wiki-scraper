Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Sunderland Mk V is rather finicky in the air. Handling is not all that bad, turn time is about 20-25 seconds spaded with flaps. However, the wings can only take 3-4Gs before they snap off. Due to the low rip speed, this means you can potentially rip your wings when flying a spaded aircraft at top speed.\n\nIf there is no water available to land in, it will be necessary to belly land on the airfields. If so, take care to not let the pontoons touch the ground. However, after descending all the way for the landing, it will be necessary to continue the fight at a low altitude due to the Sunderland's atrocious climb rate forbidding any chance of reaching back to optimal bombing altitude in a timely manner.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,267 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nAfter unloading your ordnance, it's best to return to base (or wait for reload in arcade battles) and get another load. In RB/SB, taking note from the \"Flight Performance\" section, land appropriately and continue the fight at a lower altitude to get back quickly for another bomb drop.\n\nAt this low altitude, and with some degree of luck, the Sunderland can be used as a \"gunship\" fighter. It's possible to gunship manoeuvre into a furball and shoot down a plane or two. Against other bombers, attempting the \"gunship\" method is possible, however you must be careful of defensive weapons on the enemy bomber. The best bet is to fly just below the enemy fighter or side by side, as there are no bombers at this battle rating which have this kind of armament and the Sunderland's survivability against rifle calibre is exceptional. The forward MGs can be used, but it isn't as effective as the other turrets. The side of the aircraft is where all the main firepower is located. Knowing this, keeping your enemy in the top and rear hemisphere is advisable for maximum guns on target while being shielded from most defensive weapons.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The crew are vulnerable. A few good hits on the cockpit and you're going down\n* Wooden fuselage means that you will catch fire easily\n* Slow, even biplanes can catch you\n* Does not dive well. Escaping from an enemy aircraft is difficult\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

The Mark V version of the Sunderland was initially developed due to concerns that the aircraft was underpowered, due to this the Bristol Pegasus engines used on previous models were replaced by Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp (S3C4-G) engines, these new engines offered a considerable power increase while also not causing any reductions in range or flight time, a particular benefit of the new power plant was that the Mark V could remain airborne after 2 of its 4 engines failed, this greatly improved the aircraft's survivability in comparison to earlier versions. A total of 155 Mark V airframes were produced with an additional 33 earlier Mark III's converted to Mark V standard with the updated engines.\n\nThe Mark V also featured a new centimetric ASV Mark VI C radar, this is an updated version of the air to surface radar that was also featured on later production Mark III airframes and is especially noticeable by the antenna on the underside of the wings just outboard of the floats. This radars was primarily used in the aircraft's coastal command role for detecting enemy ships.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sunderland_mk5 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341983-short-sunderland-mk-v/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Short}}\n{{Britain bombers}}"}}
