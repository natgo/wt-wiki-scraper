In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6703-event-winner-vehicles-for-the-victory-anniversary-en|Victory Day]] event.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nWhile the Swordfish Mk II boasts a good stall speed, performing sharp turns will bleed your speed at an alarming rate. Under no circumstances should you attempt a steeply banked turn near the ground as you will lose a lot of altitude in the process. Instead, perform a shallow banked turn with the assistance of the rudder.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 1,800 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThis aircraft will ultimately be outperformed by any aircraft it faces, so its key strength is the payload. Most noticeably, the RP-3 rockets which can be fired independently of each other is sufficient to attack light pillboxes and light to medium tanks, even at higher tiers!\n\nIn air RB, try to avoid getting into air combat as your weaponry is insufficient. When it comes to defending yourself, you really don't have much of a choice. Your machine guns are inadequate and most players would shrug off your spray. The recommendation is to always have a teammate keeping an eye on you as you do your duties\n\nIn Ground RB, spawn only if you think that the enemy does not have anti-aircraft vehicles in battle since your slow speed makes it easy for the enemy to shoot you down!\n\nIn Naval battles, you should only engage naval targets when you think the target is distracted (for example, while they're attacking an allied ship).\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Despite being extremely obsolete by the outbreak of the Second World war, the Swordfish remained a crucial asset to the Fleet Air Arm. It was involved in many notable engagements, including the hunt for ''Bismarck'' and attack on Taranto. The Mk II variant was introduced in 1943, and featured the ability to mount rockets on underwing brackets.<ref name=\":0\">Navy Wings. (2020)</ref>\n\n=== Design and development ===\nThe Fairey Swordfish was developed as an advanced variant of the earlier Fairey III, with the working name of TSR (Torpedo Spotting Reconnaissance) 1. The TSR-1 model was unsuccessful, and so a second TSR-2 model was developed - this model would eventually enter service as the actual Swordfish.<ref name=\":0\" /> The aircraft first flew in 1934, and entered service with the Royal Navy in 1936. However, it was already obsolete by the time it entered service, due to its biplane design and slow speed. Despite this, the aircraft still entered service in large numbers.\n\nThe aircraft, being designed for operation on aircraft carrier decks, was equipped with folding wings.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was powered by the Bristol Pegasus, a 9-cylinder radial that was state-of-the-art when the Swordfish entered service. Despite the powerful engine, the Swordfish could only reach 90 knots (166 km/h) unloaded.<ref name=\":0\" /> The crew of three sat in an open cockpit that provided minimal protection against both flak and weather. The aircraft was armed with two rifle-calibre guns (one firing forward and one firing backwards), and could carry up to 1,500 lbs of bombs, mines, torpedoes or rockets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Operational history ===\nThe Swordfish, despite being extremely obsolete by the start of the Second World War, engaged in a multitude of conflicts. The aircraft played a key role in the Attack on Taranto in November of 1940, which crippled the Italian fleet and would later be used by the Japanese as a blueprint for Pearl Harbour.<ref name=\":0\" /> Swordfishes were also responsible for crippling the battleship ''Bismarck'', which was later sunk by British surface ships. During its time with the Fleet Air Arm, the Swordfish was affectionately nicknamed the 'Stringbag', a reference to the shopping bags used at the time; this referenced the Swordfish's ability to carry almost any ordnance that the FAA could fit on it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Swordfish Mk II was developed as the second Swordfish iteration and was first introduced in 1943. It was fitted with a new, metal lower wing section, allowing it to carry rockets on underwing racks.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Swordfish Mk II saw extensive service as a convoy escort, in the Atlantic and in the Arctic. During the course of the Second World War, the Swordfish distinguished itself as a highly reliable reconnaissance and torpedo bomber aircraft. The aircraft sank 21 submarines, numerous surface ships, and was responsible for the highest tonnage of Axis shipping destroyed by a single Allied aircraft type.<ref name=\":0\" /> Several Swordfishes still exist today, including a flight-capable Swordfish Mk II operated by Navy Wings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=swordfish_mk2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== References ===\n;Citations\n<references />\n\n;Bibliography\n* Navy Wings.
