In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\n[[File:T18B-2 in action for CAS role.jpg|thumb|250px|T18B in action for CAS role]]\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]].\n\nThe T18B is an attacker/bomber designed to take out ground targets and give support. Designed and built by SAAB for use by the Swedish Air Force, it bears similarities to the [[T18B-1]]. The B-2 is the version which carries the 57 mm akan m/47 autocannon with a 41-round magazine to take out heavily armoured opponents. It is an attacker-in-disguise in terms of flight performance and firepower, with the downsides that come from housing a large-calibre autocannon.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe flight performance of the T18B is very good. Powered by two Daimler-Benz DB 605B piston engines, this bomber offers twin-engine fighter grade flight performance even with the weight of the 57 mm cannon, achieving a respectable climb rate and a competitive turn radius. It also has an amazing level flight speed. Because the airframe was first designed for both torpedo bomber and dive bomber roles, this aircraft offers amazing low-speed manoeuvrability and respectable high-speed manoeuvrability, complementing the armament in targeting responsiveness.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|sb m/42 (50 kg)|hprak m/49|psrak m/49B|srak m/51}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* 8 x 50 kg sb m/42 bombs (400 kg total)\n* 8 x psrak m/49B rockets\n* 8 x srak m/51 rockets\n* 8 x hprak m/49 rockets\n* 8 x 50 kg sb m/42 bombs + 8 x psrak m/49B rockets (400 kg total)\n* 8 x 50 kg sb m/42 bombs + 8 x srak m/51 rockets (400 kg total)\n* 8 x 50 kg sb m/42 bombs + 8 x hprak m/49 rockets (400 kg total)\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Akan m/39 (13.2 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 13.2 mm Akan m/39 machine gun, dorsal turret (300 rpg)\n\nUse the \"Universal\" belt, as the HEF-T bullet is good at knocking down enemies out of the sky.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n'''Close air support'''\n\nWith its triple set of armament controlled separately, efficiency is the biggest key factor for CAS pilots who are looking to make a dent in the enemy's forces. Use the separate controls for primary, secondary, and additional armament to use them separately for different purposes. 57 mm for armoured targets, 13.2 mm for small targets that needs precision like machine gun nests or lightly armoured car convoys, 20 mm for large soft targets like anti-air emplacements or artillery positions. If you play CAS in Air RB, you are aware of the fact that enemy fighters at the start of the game will come after you. Therefore, it is highly recommended to sneak into the remote ground targets that are away from enemy airfields or to wait a little until after your team's fighters have established air superiority. To destroy as much as possible without having to return and rearm, trigger discipline is highly recommended.\n\n'''Bomber interception'''\n\nHaving a 57 mm autocannon opens up interesting possibilities against other bombers, especially heavy bombers with a sturdy airframe. With the altitude advantage you get from the airspawn, it is possible to catch the bombers before they get high above. But being a heavy twin-engine bomber, you will be vulnerable to the bomber's defensive fire. This is where the autocannon comes into play: most turrets at this BR won't be accurate enough to do sustained damage at 1.5 km distance and beyond, but your 57 mm cannon can. It is recommended to use the High-Explosive belts to destroy the target in a single hit, avoid the Armour-piercing belt that causes the shell to go straight on without further damage. If you struggle with the leading of the gun without tracers, the AP-T belt might be better suited for the player.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Excellent offensive armament\n* The 57 mm cannon is effective against ground targets.\n* Very fast and agile for its class.\n* Can carry up extra rockets and bombs added to the offensive armament.\n* Very good in a bomber hunter role.\n* Sturdy airframe.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Only one turret, gunner is vulnerable.\n* Poor bomb load options (confined to ground attack role).\n* Very unfavourable rocket placement requiring extreme lead.\n* Weak rudder authority at moderate speeds.\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
