It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 \"Battle March\"]].\n\nThe Ta 152 C-3 should be considered the pinnacle of the Fw 190 Dora, evolving their concept to an extreme. This plane was designed for mid altitude combat, with a redesigned short wing similar to that of the late 190 series, such as the [[Fw 190 D-13]]. With its Daimler-Benz DB 603 engine, gaining speed and altitude is the first priority in this aircraft. Second is heavy usage of Boom and Zoom tactics, especially on heavily armed strategic bombers like the [[B-17 (Family)|B-17 Flying Fortress]]. With its armament of four MG-151 20 mm cannons (two in the wing roots, two in the cowling), and a MK-103 cannon firing through the propeller hub, trigger discipline is a must to take down as many aircraft as you can with the ammunition on board. However, it can be pushed to turn tight in a pinch with a rather small amount of energy lost by using the flaps. The flaps are extremely strong and they deploy quickly, even at higher speeds (though it is not advisable to do this unless the situation is just right).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nCurrently the Ta 152 C-3 does not carry any under-wing ordnance, but it can perform rather lethal ground-pounding with its [[MK 103 (30 mm)]] cannon, if it is loaded with armoured target rounds (HVAP). Although, one must aim carefully and have good trigger discipline to knock out tanks, lest too many shells be wasted on a single vehicle. But for its intended role of air superiority, the combination of [[MG 151/20 (20 mm)|MG 151]] 20 mm cannons plus the aforementioned MK 103 is lethal against any aircraft in the game. However, the stock belts can be a bit of a pain to use, as half of the load are not the infamous German Minengeschoß (HEI).\n\nThe Ta 152 C-3 is somewhat of a combination of the Fw 190 D series and the Ta 152 H-1, it is easy to play, but difficult to master and is easily countered by the enemy, but that will not stop you from doing well with this aircraft as long as you fight engagements on your terms.\n\n* Prioritize enemies with multiple engines first, like bombers, attackers and heavy fighters above anything else\n* Only engage enemy fighters when they are distracted at something else or if you have the advantage or when there are no other targets in your vicinity\n* Despite being heavily armoured, you are not invincible, head on engagements eventually will take the toll on your plane, so fight smart by firing first when you are around 1.2 km away and immediately roll or bank to dodge their bullets\n* Although it is tempting, engaging ground units should be the least of your priorities unless there are no other targets nearby\n* HVAP shells can destroy AI light tanks in one hit from any direction, medium tanks will need to be shot from above or the rear and heavy tanks are just a waste of ammo\n* 30 mm Minengeschoß rounds deal a lot of damage, use it sparingly with the 20 mm\n* The 20 mm and the 30 mm have different ballistics, binding different controls for each calibre is recommended\n* When you have a determined enemy on your tail, there is little you can do except to wait for allies to come and help, do not let it happen\n* Use your incredible roll rate to escape from sticky situations\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nThroughout much of World War II in Europe, the German Luftwaffe was only concerned with their aircraft flying in the mid to low altitudes (20,000 ft/6,100 m and below), therefore a majority of their fighter fleet only utilized a single-stage supercharger which was sufficient for their role. However, with the introduction of the [[B-29A-BN|B-29]], the threat of this type of bomber would have been out of reach for most of the German air fleet.<ref name=\"Militaryfactory\" /> To counter high-altitude allied fighters and bombers, the Fw 190D-9 was modified with a two-stage supercharged Junkers Jumo 213E engine which allowed it to achieve the higher altitudes, however, the shorter stubby wings well know for low altitude manoeuvrability actually hindered performance at altitude, though usable, not really a suitable fix.<ref name=\"Historyofwar\" />\n\nAnswering the call of the German Air Ministry (RLM – Reichsluftfahrtministerium), Focke-Wulf modified their Fw 190 design and branched out in three directions. The three prototypes, in turn, had one to become the new existing Fw 190D (Ta 152A) series (after the D-9), the second prototype would become a dedicated high-altitude bomber (Ta 152B) while the third would become a ground-attack aircraft (Ta 152H).<ref name=\"Historyofwar\" />  Though adjustments and modifications were made including usage of a different engine, the ultimate results determined these aircraft did not provide enough improvement to continue moving forward and both the Ta 152A and B projects were cancelled. One bright spot from this was that the airframe built for the Ta 152B (the V21 airframe) showed promise and efforts were focused here to create the Ta 152C prototype.<ref name=\"Historyofwar\" />\n\nIn 1944 the RLM made a ruling that new fighter aircraft were to include the chief designer's name in the aircraft's designation. What was earlier knows as a Focke-Wulf aircraft was now listed with the prefix Ta which was short for ''Kurt Tank'', though Tank was still working for Focke-Wulf at the time.\n\nAdjustments to the Fw 190D-9 fuselage resulted in its extension and addition of hydraulics to control the flaps and landing gear. These adjustments threw off the normal centre of gravity and made the aircraft off balance, resulting in the lengthening of the nose of the aircraft to normalize the CoG. The length of the wings was slightly lengthened and due to shortages in aluminium, steel spars were utilised aiding to the strength of the wings, but also at a price of extra weight.<ref name=\"Historyofwar\" />\n\n;Ta 152C variant\n\nThe Ta 152C-3 ended up with wings .5 m (1.25 ft) longer than the standard Fw 190D-9 to aid in supporting the new steel spars and hydraulic hardware in the landing gear and flaps. The 'C' variant did not incorporate a pressurized cockpit. While designed to work at lower altitudes (though above 25,000 ft or 6,100 m), the fighter was outfitted with a single 30 mm MK 108 Motorkanone which was mounted  through the center propeller hub with four MG 151/20 mm cannons, two of which were mounted in the upper fuselage and two more with one in each wing.<ref name=\"Militaryfactory\" /> This cannon setup is enough to devastate any aircraft which is on the receiving end of the 20 and 30 mm rounds. The Ta 152C-3 entered the war too late and in too little numbers to make an effective difference. Shortages in replacement parts became extremely difficult if not impossible to find reducing the ability of the Ta 152C-3 to be used to the fullest of its abilities.<ref name=\"Historyofwar\" />\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ta-152c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|d5k2T9FP0bQ|'''Avoid them in frontal attack!''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:39 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|4v3fxupuZPA|'''Last piston fighters''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:39 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|hN38Hj_F9sU|'''War Thunder Realistic: Ta 152 C-3 [Battlestar Galactica!]''' - ''Jengar''|iKTe9p-Awhw|'''Ta 152 C-3 - I Can't Let It Go Like That!''' - ''Napalmratte''|nxQfEs1DfAQ|'''Ta 152 C3 - 1 Vs 1 - Tactics and strategies''' - ''Green Fury''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* Focke-Wulf [[Fw 190 (Family)|Fw 190]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* Lavochkin [[La-9]]\n* Nakajima [[Ki-87]]\n* Martin-Baker [[MB.5]]\n* North American [[P-51 (Family)|P-51]]\n* Macchi [[C.205N2|C.205]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/303488-focke-wulf-ta-152-c-3/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Ta_152 [Wikipedia<nowiki>]</nowiki> Focke-Wulf Ta 152]\n* [https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/focke-wulf-ta-152-h-0r11 [Smithsonian<nowiki>]</nowiki> Focke-Wulf Ta 152 H-0/R11]\n\n=== References ===\n\n<references>\n<ref name=\"Historyofwar\">Focke-Wulf Ta 152C.
