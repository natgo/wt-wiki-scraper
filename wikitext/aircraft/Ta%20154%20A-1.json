It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]].  The Ta 154 A-1 is part of the [[Affiliate_Program_Revenue_Share|revenue share program]] and was created by Vitaly \"NovA29R\" Vostokov (model) and Michael \"__StrafeMike__\"  Ioannidis (texture).\n\nThe Ta 154 A-1 has very powerful frontal armament, placed in the fuselage, which can give you quick and easy kills. Unfortunately, it doesn't turn very well at low speeds so it is recommended to keep your speed up and Boom & Zoom. Turning should be a last resort. If you try to get an edge in a turn-fight using your flaps, you should watch your speed as your flaps can break off very easily at speeds above 450 km/h (279 mph). The roll-rate of the Ta 154 is almost as good as the Fw 190's roll-rate, this is due to the fact that there are no fuel tanks in the wings. This advantage can and should most definitely be used when flying evasively but when at low altitude, do periodically check what's in front of you.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

At the start of a battle, climbing is recommended. From there, you can either go after lone bombers or dive on unsuspecting fighters below you.\n\nBeware of fighters such as P-47s, P-51s, Yaks, Spitfires, and J2Ms as they can outclimb you, and therefore can have an altitude advantage over you. In terms of bombers, notable targets include B-17s, B-24s and Lancasters: all these bombers are more than capable of defending themselves with their numerous turrets.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Do not set it lower than 90% as it will result in noticeable performance loss. Unlike most German aircraft, the Ta-154 uses a constant speed propeller and there is no risk of overrevving the engine. \n* '''Radiator''' - Varies with map. On cold maps (Smolensk, snow-covered maps) 15% should be enough to keep WEP on permanently. On summer maps keep the radiator around 50%. On hot maps (Spain, Sicily) values above 80% might be required to sustain WEP for long periods of time.\n* '''Supercharger''' - The optimal supercharger gear switch altitude is 3,500 m, although it can vary slightly depending on map and airspeed.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It was eventually cancelled as it was to complicated to build for war-torn Nazi Germany.\n\nThe origins of the Ta-154 dated back to the late 1930s when Kurt Tank and his engineers were working on a twin-engined medium bomber called the Ta-211. It was planned to be made out of plywood bonded with a special chemical called Tego film. Only the pressurized cockpit would be made out of metal. The aircraft was supposed to use the Jumo 211r engine (which was why the Ta-211 had the number 211) but was instead fitted with the more powerful Jumo 213 engine when Junkers could not produce the Jumo 211r in time. The aircraft's serial number was changed to 8-154 and it was given the name Moskito as a tribute to the RAF's Dh.98 Mosquito.\n\nThe Ta-154V1 prototype made its first flight on July 1st, 1943 with the Jumo 211F engine. A few days later, the V2 prototype with the Jumo 211N took off for the first time. In trials, the Ta-154 easily outperformed its rivals- Ju-388 and He-219. The Ta-154 reached at top speed of 700km/h or 440mph in testing. The V3 prototype was equipped with radar and a second seat for the radar operator and was consequently 75km/h slower than the other two prototypes with its heavy night fighting equipment. \n\nIn early 1944, the Jumo 213 engines finally arrived and a production run of 150 plus Ta-154A-1 models were ordered. Several were produced before the factory making the Tego-film glue was destroyed. As a result, the Germans substituted the Tego-film glue with an inferior type of glue. This inferior type proved to be complete garbage as several Ta-154s created with it fell apart in flight. Similar problems also struck the He-162 Volksjäger.\n\nIn August of 1944, Kurt Tank finally ordered the end of production of what could have been an amazing fighter as the Germans needed to turn their attention to faster aircraft like the Do-335 and could not waste time or resources. With that, the few Ta-154s built were used in night fighters squadrons or in training units. Several Ta-154s out of the 50 or so built saw combat in World War 2 as night fighters until the war ended. With that, the Ta-154s were examined or scrapped. One was captured by American forces but its fate is unknown.\n\nEven though the Ta-154 only had a minor impact in real life, you can take control of the mighty Ta-154 in War Thunder and wreak havoc on the bombers that escaped its wrath back in WW2.\n\n<ref>https://ww2db.com/aircraft_spec.php?aircraft_model_id=322</ref> <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Ta_154</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ta_154a_1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|-jmSoAvIsv4|'''The Shooting Range #26''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 06:05 discusses the Ta 154 A-1.|uJziizNMYj8|'''The Shooting Range #164''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:32 discusses the Ta 154 A-1.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/341979-focke-wulf-ta154a-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{AirManufacturer Focke-Wulf}}\n{{Germany twin-engine fighters}}\n{{Germany premium aircraft}}"}}
