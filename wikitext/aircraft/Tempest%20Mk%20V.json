Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\nThe Tempest Mk.V has a fairly average level of survivability compared to most single engine fighters. In terms of armour, the pilot is protected by 16.9 mm of steel in their seat, and 44.5 mm of bulletproof glass at the front of the cockpit. This armour will protect the pilot against machinegun and some cannon rounds from the direct front and rear, but is fairly weak and does not cover all angles. The Napier Sabre 2 24 cylinder engine is somewhat robust, and should continue to function for some time after being hit with a few rounds. The plane will continue to fly after taking some hits to the fuselage, wings, or tail, but with increasingly dramatic reductions in manoeuvrability as more damage is taken. Especially hits to the wings dis-balance the plane, and make turning especially difficult. Overall the plane should not be expected to survive long against enemies with substantial levels of firepower (such as the [[MG 151 (20 mm)|MG-151]] cannon).\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nClimb with your team as high as you can muster (<4,000 m) and proceed to feast on anything the Spitfires above drop from their clouds.  Speed is life and should never be wasted. Maintaining its velocity is the way of the Tempest in realistic battles.\n\nThe Tempest Mk. V excels at low to medium altitude battles, performing both as a Boom'n'Zoomer, ground attacker or energy fighter. To efficiently utilise its full engine power, do not get above 6,000 m or 19,000 ft, as the engine power drops significantly beyond that point. However, due to the supercharged engine, it outperforms aircraft like the Fw 190 D-9 by far at high altitudes (over 7,600 m or 25,000 ft) but gets obliterated by Ta 152Hs and some Bf 109 models, such as the K-4s and G-10s. To counter the BF109K-4, pilot Pierre Clostermann was quoted as saying:\n\n\"Tempest V. Messerschmitts: I kept on reminding my pilots to keep their speed above 300 m.p.h., for \"109's\" could turn better than we could at low speed, and you had to watch out for the 30 mm cannon in their propeller - it didn't give you a second chance. The best technique was to do a spiral dive, work up to a speed of 450 m.p.h., do a straight climb and then start all over again. The \"109's\" on the other hand, knowing that we dived faster than they did, tried to get us up to 16,000 feet, where our Tempests were heavy and our engines sluggish.\"\n\nIn Arcade battles, stick with WEP on and Boom & Zoom tactics. On realistic you can try the above strategy, but you may find that due to mouse aim some adaptations must be implemented. Don't lose sight of your attacker and be on guard for when his cannon fires. As soon as you see the barrel flash, you have about 0.7 seconds to take your plane out of the way, depending on the distance. At that point, you can throw off his aim by performing a low Yo-Yo to gain more speed and proceed to zoom away if you're below 3,000 m or 10,000 ft, because at this altitude your engine should provide enough power for you to outrun the BF109K-4 or G-10. However, you may find that the Tempest Mk.V is a cinder brick because you accelerate stupidly fast diving straight to the ground. When in trouble at high heights, dive like there is no tomorrow.\n\n==== As CAS Fighter: ====\nTempest is one of the better British aircraft for mixed battles at its rating, carrying payload vastly superior to that of Spitfires, and performing much better than [[Hornet Mk.III|Hornet]] when it comes to dogfights. Its 2x[[M.C. Mk.I (1,000 lb)|1000lb M.C. Mk.I]] are enough to take out any tank within ~5m radius, and the airframe is capable of pulling out of all but the most extreme dive drops. It also has access to 8 tried and true [[RP-3]] rockets; while they may struggle to penetrate heavier tanks you will face even from the side, hit on the top of the turret will often one-shot the target.\n\n[[Hispano Mk.V (20 mm)|Hispano Mk.V]]'s ground targets belt lacks penetration to kill medium and heavy tanks' crews even when fired directly from above, but it doesn't mean one should abandon it completely. These guns are accurate enough to shoot engine decks from a fair distance, which often knocks out the engine and/or sets the fuel tanks on fire, even with just a few shots. Immobilizing enemy tanks when they are engaged in battle or crossing an open spot is always a good help to the team on the ground.\n\nAlternatively, you can also play an air superiority role. The advice is pretty much the same as for Air RB - stay high and stay fast.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The Typhoon had many deficiencies such as an unreliable engine, insufficient structural strength leading in some cases to the entire tail detaching, a sub-standard rate of climb and poor high altitude performance. Because of these, it could not compete with the latest fighter of the time, the German Focke-Wolf FW190, and the Typhoon's was removed from its planned role as an interceptor and used mainly for ground strike missions. The Tempest prototype, first flown in February 1943, inherited some of the traits of its older brother, but experts took into account Hawker's negative experience and did their best to refine the aerodynamic shape of the new aircraft. The wing was slightly shorter, the profile more slender, and the back edge elliptical. Compensating the fuel capacity lost in the newly designed, thinner wings, came in the way of adding another fuel tank to the fuselage which accounted for the increased length of the aircraft. Consequently, the tail section was also modified, most noticeably by a fairing fitted to the vertical fin's leading edge and an increase of the tailplane chord.\n\nDue to the unavailability of Napier Sabre Mk IV engine, which was supposed to keep the new aircraft from having the Typhoon's \"beard\" radiator, the same Sabre Mk IIA engine, rated at 2,180 HP, had to be installed along with a four-bladed de Havilland propeller. On the first batch of Tempests (100 aircraft) the armament stayed unchanged, but subsequent fighters had the long-barrelled Hispano Mk II gun replaced with the more rapid and light Hispano Mk V. The ammunition was also increased from 140 to 150 rounds per gun. Thanks to the strength of its wings, the aircraft could carry a substantial bomb load or two 500 lb or 1000 lb bombs, two 45 or 90-gallon fuel tanks, or eight 76 mm rockets. The Tempest proved far more successful and popular with its pilots than the Typhoon, eliminating its predecessor's shortcomings.\n\nFront line service for the Tempest began in April 1944, when 50 Tempest Mk Vs formed the first Tempest Wing at Newchurch. The Tempest Wing was particularly active in the build-up to D-Day, but when the first German V-1 flying bombs began to fall on British soil, the Tempest was found to be one of the only fighters fast enough to counter the new threat. Fast, manoeuvrable and heavily armed, the Tempest was also able to prove a threat to the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter by destroying a total of 20 262s. Some 1,700 Tempests were manufactured until the aircraft was phased out of service with the RAF in 1949.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nFrom its initial conception, the Hawker Tempest was conceived of as a replacement for the Typhoon, a fighter-bomber created by the Hawker company in 1941.
