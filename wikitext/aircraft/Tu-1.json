In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Direct Hit\"]]. A perfect addition for ground and naval battles at mid tiers.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Tupolev Tu-1 has a high top speed. However, its acceleration is noticeably slow as it is a heavy aircraft and it is degraded even further by the drag of bombs carried externally.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 7,150 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIn RB, the aircraft is given a strike fighter spawn, meaning it does not have as much room to dive and gain speed as a bomber. The Tu-1 is capable of destroying enemy fighters in head-on engagements or unsuspecting attackers, thanks to its 23 mm and 45 mm cannons. For usage in combined forces, the Tu-1 makes for a very potent attacker, carrying three 1,000 kg bombs as well as the pair of 45 mm cannons having the option to fire API-T rounds, which can knock out all but the heaviest tanks at its BR from the tops and sides.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The first tests of the Tu-2 convinced the military authorities to initiate development for the role of a heavy fighter. However, the outbreak of the war forced the designers to focus on the modifications of the Tu-2 bomber series. Nonetheless, work on the version of the heavy fighter did not stop, moreover, one of the key components of the new aircraft was to become a radar, which would allow the location of targets at distances of up to 8 km and at any time of the day. Andrey Tupolev personally attended lectures on aviation radars, after which he enthusiastically started adapting the latest developments on his aircraft. In the meantime, work continued on enhancing the combat and flight characteristics of the aircraft. The armament was significantly improved compared to the original concepts - two 45-mm NS-45 guns were installed in the front of the bomb bay, supported by 2x 23-mm guns in the wings. The defensive armament of the aircraft was represented by two 12.7mm UBT machine guns. After experiments with the power-plant, the choice fell on the M-43V engines with a four-blade propeller. The finished prototype made her maiden flight only in the spring of 1947. Despite the good test results, the project of the Tupolev heavy fighter was not continued. The era of jet aircraft was approaching.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=tu-1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nTu-1_WTWallpaper001.jpg\nTu-1_WTWallpaper002.jpg\nTu-1_WTWallpaper003.jpg\nTu-1_WTWallpaper004.jpg\nTu-1_WTWallpaper005.jpg\nTu-1_WTWallpaper006.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|WKnekjUG4j0|'''Premium Vehicles: Tu-1''' - ''War Thunder Wiki''|ugkbuwD5zrg|'''The Shooting Range #273''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:30 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[F7F-3]]\n* [[Tu-2]] / [[Tu-2S]]\n* [[Me 410 A-1]]\n* [[Hornet Mk.III]]\n* [[Ki-83]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7329-development-tu-1-the-tzar-of-heavy-gunners-en|[Devblog] Tu-1: the Tzar of Heavy Gunners]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/534209-tu-1/ [Aircraft Data Sheets<nowiki>]</nowiki> Tu-1]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Tupolev}}\n{{USSR strike aircraft}}\n{{USSR premium aircraft}}"}}
