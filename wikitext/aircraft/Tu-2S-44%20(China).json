Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|ShVAK (20 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 2 x 20 mm ShVAK cannons, wing-mounted (150 rpg = 300 total)\n\nThe Tu-2's powerful offensive armament of two 20 mm ShVAK cannons sets it apart from other bombers , most of which lack any offensive armament at all. Although not having amazing penetration the cannons are still useful against AI ground target in air battles, and some of the more lightly armoured vehicles in ground battles. The cannons also allow you to use your air spawn to engage enemy bombers, and can even be used again enemy fighters at opportune moments. The cannons mounting at the base of the wings means that convergence is not too bad of a problem, and the amount of ammo is fairly decent as well.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|FAB-100sv (100 kg)|FAB-250sv (250 kg)|FAB-500sv (500 kg)|FAB-1000 (1,000 kg)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* 2 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (500 kg total)\n* 9 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (900 kg total)\n* 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs + 2 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (1,500 kg total)\n* 4 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (2,000 kg total)\n* 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (1,000 kg total)\n* 1 x 1,000 kg FAB-1000 bomb (1,000 kg total)\n* 1 x 1,000 kg FAB-1000 bomb + 2 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (1,500 kg total)\n* 1 x 1,000 kg FAB-1000 bomb + 2 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (2,000 kg total)\n\nThe ␗Tu-2S-44 has the same bombload options as its counterpart in the Soviet tech tree, the [[Tu-2S-44]]. At 2,000 kg the maximum bomb load is fairly good for a light bomber, but nothing special compared to most bombers around this BR. If you are trying to kill ground targets then the 4 x 500 kg bombs loadout gives the best balance of lethality and number of bombs. Bombs can be dropped individually, making the load very effective.\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Berezin UB (12.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, front dorsal turret (190 rpg)\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, rear dorsal turret (250 rpg)\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine gun, rear ventral turret (350 rpg)\n\nThe defensive armament of the Tu-2S-44 is among the worst it this battle rating, consisting only of three 12.7 mm machine guns. In addition the front dorsal turret and ventral turret have fairly narrow firing arcs; and none of the guns have a particularly impressive ammo pool. They can be useful in some situations, but you should generally not rely on the defensive guns for your survival.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nOnce spawned (~3,500 m), locate what ground targets to engage. It is suggested to engage the targets farthest from the enemy's airfield in order to avoid detection. Attack pillboxes (light or heavy, it doesn't matter with 500 kg bombs) as these don't move. Only engage the AI tanks if there are no pillboxes, and if engaging the tanks, judge the speed of the tank column, and release the bombs, making sure to lead where the tanks will be as the bombs fall, not where they are in that moment.\n\nWhen bombing anything, note that the center of the reticle should be aimed below the target by about a centimetre (looking at the screen). This will allow the bombs maximum precision. Remember to open the bomb bay doors before attempting to drop the bombs. Once the payload has dropped, begin attacking artillery and AAA guns with the 20 mm cannons. Fire in short bursts to conserve ammo, as the more of these light targets are destroyed, the better. Never attack light pillboxes with the frontal cannons! The ammo spent attempting to destroy these (~200 rounds) isn't worth it! Always attack lighter targets, or if the situation presents itself, enemy aircraft. Once the bombs and cannon ammo are exhausted, then high-tail it back to the airfield. Fully upgraded, the Tu-2S can maintain ~450 km/h on the deck, no problem. Be careful upon landing, as the plane tends to stall at ~175 km/h. Rearm, and repeat!\n\n'''Specific enemies worth noting'''\n\n'''Late War Props ([[Spitfire F Mk 24]], [[Fw 190 D-13]], [[F8F-1B]], etc.):'''\n\nThese are constant opponents at the battle rating, so they should never be ignored. If possible, run back to base and don't commit to a head-on with props, as they have a little more time to aim their shots and steady their plane. Rely mostly on the defensive turrets if needed.\n\n'''Player-Controlled Flak ([[Kugelblitz]], [[Crusader AA Mk II]], etc.):'''\n\nThese are the bane of bombers (especially medium-sized ones such as the Tu-2S-44). When the tracers fly, don't risk a dive. Circle around or find some unsuspecting flanker that is outside the cover of these AAA guns.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was planned that PVAF would assault the island, supporting the landing forces in November; earlier in the month, Tu-2s bombed the island with 95% accuracy over the targets; but on the 30th November, due to the lack of escorting jet fighters, these 9 Tu-2 were only accompanied by 16 [[La-11 (China)|La-11]] and they have to face 30 [[F-86 Sabre (Family)|F-86 Sabres]] from USAF, this caused the distraction of bombers and 4 Tu-2 were loss during the battle.\n\nWhile they saw some losses during the Korean War, in January 1955, Tu-2 along with IL-10, were saw during the very first tri-service landing operation of PLA- the battle of Yijiangshan Island (一江山岛) off the coast of Zhejiang, forcing the Nationalist forces to retreat from Dachen Island (大陈岛) and marking the total loss of Zhejiang, leaving only Matsu and Kinmen of Fujian the remaining Nationalist-controlled area off-coast of Mainland China. Tu-2 were then saw in riot-suppression operations at southwestern China on the Tibetan Plateau, soon PLAAF realized that Tu-2 was not enough to handle the CIA-supplied rebels with M2HBs via air-drop and eventually have to deploy [[Tu-4 (China)|Tu-4]] as a gunship, replacing Tu-2 for supporting the PLAGF with those 10 x 23 mm autocannons on-board.<ref>http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/p/2008-12-11/0810534238.html</ref>\n\nThese Tu-2 were eventually decommissioned in 1982 and marked the end of propeller-driven frontline bombers in PLAAF service.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=tu-2_postwar_china Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== References ===\n<references/>\n\n{{AirManufacturer Tupolev}}\n{{China bombers}}"}}
