If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nOnce spawned (~3,500 m), locate what ground targets to engage. It is suggested to engage the targets farthest from the enemy's airfield in order to avoid detection. Attack pillboxes (light or heavy, it doesn't matter with 500 kg bombs) as these don't move. Only engage the AI tanks if there are no pillboxes, and if engaging the tanks, judge the speed of the tank column, and release the bombs, making sure to lead where the tanks will be as the bombs fall, not where they are in that moment.\n\nWhen bombing anything, note that the center of the reticule should be aimed below the target by about a centimetre (looking at the screen). This will allow the bombs maximum precision. Remember to open the bomb bay doors before attempting to drop the bombs. Once the payload has dropped, begin attacking artillery and AAA guns with the 20 mm cannons. Fire in short bursts to conserve ammo, as the more of these light targets are destroyed, the better. Never attack light pillboxes with the frontal cannons! The ammo spent attempting to destroy these (~200 rounds) isn't worth it! Always attack lighter targets, or if the situation presents itself, enemy aircraft. Once the bombs and cannon ammo are exhausted, then high-tail it back to the airfield. Fully upgraded, the Tu-2S can maintain ~450 km/h on the deck, no problem. Be careful upon landing, as the plane tends to stall at ~175 km/h. Rearm, and repeat!\n\n'''Specific enemies worth noting'''\n\nLate War piston fighters ([[Spitfire F Mk 24]], [[Fw 190 D-13]], [[F8F-1B]], etc.) - These are constant opponents at the battle rating, so they should never be ignored. If possible, run back to base and don't commit to a head-on with props, as they have a little more time to aim their shots and steady their plane. Rely mostly on the defensive turrets if needed.\n\nPlayer-Controlled SPAAs ([[Kugelblitz]], [[Crusader AA Mk II]], etc.) - These are the bane of bombers (especially medium-sized ones such as the Tu-2S). When the tracers fly, don't risk a dive. Circle around or find some unsuspecting flanker that is outside the cover of these AA guns.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It obtained a new version of the Shvetsov M-82FN engine, equipped with direct fuel injection, with an increased maximum engine power of 1,850 hp. The new engines improved the aircraft's flight characteristics. Also, the bomber's earlier defects were practically eliminated. In July 1943, the State Defense Committee decided to begin mass production of the Tu-2 with the M-82FN engines.\n\nThe so-called \"standard\" bombers, the Tu-2S (\"S\" meaning \"standard\"), were different from Aircraft 103VS. They were simple and cheap as far as production and operation went, with a minimum set of equipment.\n\nThe Tu-2S had the 103VS's braking vanes and their release mechanisms removed, but the dive recovery control was left intact. The stabilizer was fixed and the steering gear removed. The vertical empennage area was increased. Only the right rudder had a trim tab. The plane's fuel tanks were reduced in number, and the resulting loss in fuel capacity was somewhat compensated for by enlarging the remaining tanks.\n\nThe plane's defensive armament was similar to that of Aircraft 103VS, but the ammunition of the LU-UBT unit was increased to 350 rounds. The rocket beams and weapon controls were removed. But, unlike its predecessor, the Tu-2S was equipped with chemical weapons. It could carry UKhAP-500 aerial spray devices or ABK-P-500 clusters, which could be filled with bomblets or AZh-2 ampoules containing KS self-igniting fluid.\n\nThe first Tu-2S was built in September 1943. A total of 1,145 Tu-2S front-line bombers were produced from 1943-45.\n\nBy the end of 1942, the Tu-2 appeared on the Kalinin Front and then on the Southwestern Front. From 1944-45, the Tu-2S was used in the Baltics, Poland, and Germany, including the Battle of Berlin. In August 1945, units armed with the Tu-2S operated against Japan.\n\nThe Tu-2S is justly considered the best front-line bomber of the Red Army Air Force. It was superior to the famous Pe-2 in all its basic characteristics, especially in its defensive armament. During the war, the Tu-2S was only used by the Red Army Air Force.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=tu-2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|GwwOVKASalw|'''Ignore At Your Peril!
