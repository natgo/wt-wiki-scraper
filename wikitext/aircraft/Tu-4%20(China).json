Engaging in a head-on is recommended, as the pilots have little protection, usually knocking them both out.\n\nThe Tu-4 is a monster of an aircraft in terms of its profile and size, making it very easy to hit. Wings and the tail control are weak spots, so hitting the wings will result in severe wing damage on the Tu-4, forcing it to return to base or even sending it back to the hangar.\n\nWhile flying the Sabres, try to aim for the fuel tanks in the wings. Most of the time, just set the fuel tanks ablaze, or even blowing off the wing, sending the foe back to the hangar.\n\n'''Do not engage the Tu-4 from the six!''' Engaging the Tu-4 at its tail, especially from below, '''is''' asking for trouble. Always try to engage the Tu-4 from the top, or in head-ons, the fuselage turrets have dead zones when engaging from >~70 degrees.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|FAB-100sv (100 kg)|FAB-250sv (250 kg)|FAB-500sv (500 kg)|FAB-1000 (1,000 kg)}}\n{{main|FAB-1500M-46 (1,500 kg)|FAB-3000M-46 (3,000 kg)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* 40 x 100 kg FAB-100sv bombs (4,000 kg total)\n* 40 x 250 kg FAB-250sv bombs (10,000 kg total)\n* 12 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (6,000 kg total)\n* 20 x 500 kg FAB-500sv bombs (10,000 kg total)\n* 8 x 1,000 kg FAB-1000 bombs (8,000 kg total)\n* 8 x 1,500 kg FAB-1500M-46 bombs (12,000 kg total)\n* 4 x 3,000 kg FAB-3000M-46 bombs (12,000 kg total)\n\nThe Chinese Tu-4 has the same bomb loadouts as its Soviet counterpart, giving it a very impressive maximum load of 12,000 kg, with a wide selection of different bomb sizes. If you are looking to destroy bases in air battles then the 8 x 1,500 kg option is best as it allows more drops than the 4 x 3,000 kg bombs while still being able to destroy bases. If you are looking to do damage to the main airfield then the 4 x 3,000 kg option will give you slightly more TNT equivalent, but offers less flexibility.\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|NR-23 (23 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, front dorsal turret (275 rpg = 550 total)\n* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, rear dorsal turret (275 rpg = 550 total)\n* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, front ventral turret (250 rpg = 500 total)\n* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, rear ventral turret (500 rpg = 1,000 total)\n* 2 x 23 mm NR-23 cannons, tail turret (275 rpg = 550 total)\n\nLike the bomb load, the defensive armament of the Chinese Tu-4 remains unchanged from the Soviet model, with a total of 10 [[NR-23 (23 mm)|23 mm NR-23 cannons]] providing all-round coverage. While the defensive armament is excellent, you need to engage targets manually as the AI gunners do not engage at sufficient range to take out threats. The utility of the turrets is also lessened when facing missile-armed jets, which can engage you from longer ranges. In these cases you want to throttle down or even turn off your engines to make it harder for them to get a missile lock, and so draw them into range of your guns.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe below tactics can be used in all games modes:\n\nLike most planes of its class, the Tu-4 relies on its defensive turrets for aerial combat. A few good hits from its 10 x 23 mm guns can send an attacker back to base, with critical damage or, if not, credit the player with the victory. Maxing out the crew stats is a good idea, it will allow the player to focus more on flying while the AI does the gunning. Don't get too arrogant, remember, the Tu-4 is a huge plane. It is easy to hit, and as mentioned above, especially when the opponents could be jets.\n\nAll in all, pay attention to the aircraft's surroundings. The Tu-4 can easily net the team a win so don't let the feeling of invincibility get imbued, or the only reward will be a fiery end.\n\nWith this bomber's high battle rating, you should be actively looking out for enemy vehicles. It is possible for an attacker to have a relative closing speed of over 1000 km/h. Relying solely on the spotting system will allow some fighters to get so close it will be impossible for you to react. It is especially common for the enemy to approach either in a 30° cone straight ahead or to trail behind and below you, generally outside gun range before pulling up sharply.\n\nWhen first starting with this aircraft, the payload option is 40 x 100 kg bombs which are able to destroy numerous bases. One of the best ways to maximize the payload's effectiveness, 15 x 100 kg bombs are needed for one base. The A.I. gunners will be able to defend the plane as bombs are dropped from the bombsight until switching back to the pilot seat, ready to head to next objective. The best option for base bombing is the 8 x 1500 kg payload. A single bomb will be enough to destroy a base, provided you do not miss.\n\nOnce the Tu-4's bombing run is complete, start descending towards the friendly airfield; enemy fighters '''will''' be hunting for the Tu-4, so be more alert. The Tu-4 has a very powerful defensive system installed with 5 turrets, each with two 2 x 23 mm cannons, so the Tu-4 should be able to defend itself reasonably well. If you believe that landing would be putting the aircraft in grave danger, it is worth considering to instead stay high and shoot down approaching fighters, calling out your position will often lower the stigma associated with this action.\n\n'''Do not''' rely on the AI gunners. Most of the time the Tu-4 will face top rank jets including [[Hunter F 1|Hunter F 1s]] and [[F-86F-2|F2 Sabres]]. These adversaries are usually experienced and will not foolishly tail the bomber for long and try to engage at ranges greater than 1 km or engage in a head-on pass. These manoeuvres render the AI gunners largely useless. Laying down a stream of 23 mm rounds is recommended, but beware of jamming. Hits can be scored within 1.5 - 2 km, if somebody is tailing the Tu-4 or engaging in a head-on pass, they can also occur at greater ranges. Combine the turret shooting with a defensive style of flying to utilize it to its full potential; the Tu-4 offers good handling for its size. Be very careful when putting the Tu-4 into a dive. It is just as prone as any other aircraft to suffering structural damage if its limitations are exceeded. Do '''not''' rely on flaps to slow down, their weak construction will let you down.\n\nThe two most dangerous opponents of the Tu-4 are the [[S.O.4050 Vautour IIA]] and the [[Hunter F 1]]. With their 30mm cannons, one burst will be devastating against the Tu-4. The [[F-86F-2]] is also a dangerous opponent, with four 20 mm cannons with a very high velocity and rate of fire.\n\nWhen down tiered, the most dangerous opponents are the [[Me 163 B]], the [[Me 262 C-2b]] and the [[R2Y2 (Family)|R2Y2 KAIs]]. All equipped with 30 mm cannons, they are able to send the Tu-4 back to the hangar within one burst. The 163's and KI-200 extreme mobility are something to be wary of. It isn't uncommon for bomber pilots to lose track of the attacker after a fly by.\n\nDon't underestimate the other Sabres, such as the [[F-86F-40 (Japan)|F-86F-40]] and the [[CL-13A Mk 5|CL-13A]]. Their 12.7 mm machine guns can do a lot of damage, crippling or setting the Tu-4 afire, which could end the match for the plane there.\n\nDo not consider any enemy bomber or attacker as a neutral or even friendly party. It is quite common for [[Canberra B (I) Mk 6|Canberra]]'s or even [[B-57B|B-57]]'s to try and engage you if the opportunity presents itself.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Ten Tu-4s delivered by the end of 1953 were operated by the Fourth Independent Regiment of PLAAF and later, in 1960, two additional aircraft were aided and served as navigational training aircraft; Tu-4 were saw during the riot-suppression operations over the Tibetan Plateau as a gunship and the Sino-Indo Border War, and sometimes bombing the frozen Yellow River to reopen shipping routes.\n\n=== Shadow Aircraft 影機 ===\n[[File:Flight Path of 1960-12-19 Operation.jpg|thumb|309x309px|The flight path \"Black Bat's\" 1960-12-19 Operation]]\nAt late 1950s, a few Tu-4s in PLAAF were modified to all-weather interceptors. The forward turret was replaced by a rotatable searchlight and a RP-5 radar from MiG-17PF was installed. The modified Tu-4 can also be an airborne control plane for interceptors. According to the plan, the modified Tu-4 could track and possibly hunt down P2V-7U reconnaissance aircraft from '''34th \"Black Bat\" Squadron ''(第34“黑蝙蝠”中隊)'' of ROCAF''' for a prolonged period thanks to Tu-4's range. For the fact that reconnaissance aircraft usually conduct recon missions at low altitude and low speed at night (to avoid AA fire), the modified Tu-4 were planned to operate as gunships, using defensive turrets to take down enemy aircraft but this proved fruitless; these Tu-4s were dubbed \"'''the Shadow Aircraft ''影機'''''\" by ROCAF.\n\nA detailed information on the very first interception operations conducted by the \"Shadow Aircraft\" could be found in the Black Bat Squadron Memorial Hall in Hsinchu, their home base. The crew of this P2V flight took off from South Korea on 19 December, 1960 and survived the interception from J-5A,  \"the Shadow Aircraft\" and ground AA; only to knew the existence of such aircrafts a year later after multiple interception by these aircrafts.\n\nDue to the lack of documentation from Mainland China, aside from these aircrafts were converted back to a bomber, no further records or images left any trace of their existence\n[[File:The description of the flight and the crew.jpg|thumb|Description of the flight and crew list]]\n\n=== A Brand-New Platform ===\n[[File:KJ-1 (Tupolev Tu-4).jpg|thumb|right|380x380px|KJ-1 in public display in Beijing Aviation Museum.]]\nDue to the lack of endurance of the original Ash-73TK piston engine, in the 1970s the remaining Chinese Tu-4s installed new WJ-6 (\"渦槳-6\", Turboprop-6) turboprop engines and J17G-13 four-bladed propellers (domestic imitation of AI-20 engine and AV-68 propeller). The 4250 horsepower WJ-6 is more powerful than the original piston engine and a one-piece ventral fin or two small endplate fins at the tips of the horizontal tail were mounted to improve horizontal stability of manoeuvre characteristic. Meanwhile, all of the defensive turrets on these modified Tu-4s were removed for better performance.\n\nAt that time, the Tu-4 is the optimal heavy-weight long-range air platform operated by PLAAF, so a turboprop Tu-4 (series number 2806501, Red 4114) was chosen as the airframe of 'Plane 926', first airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) plane of PLAAF. A huge rotodome, holding the Type 843 radar, was mounted on its center station of the wings and some small antennas were installed on the fuselage, The project started at 1969 and later be called as KJ-1 (\"空警一號\", AWACS No.1). The KJ-1 ushered its first test flight in November, 1971. However, the Type 843 radar was found to be lacking in the ability to detect and track low altitude flying objects during the test, so the whole KJ program was disbanded by 1979. Currently the KJ-1 is in public display in the Chinese Aviation Museum, Beijing. Another three Tu-4s with turboprop engines were modified as ECM plane or ELINT planes.\n[[File:Tu-4 with BQM-34 underwing.jpg|left|thumb|390x390px|Chinese Tu-4 with DR-5 drone underwing in 1986.]]\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, China captured serval wrecks of Ryan BQM-34 reconnaissance drones and one of them was fixed, becoming the sample of reverse-engineering. The resulting product, called Changhong-1 (\"長虹一號\", Skylight No.1) or WZ-5 (\"無偵-5\", Unmanned reconnaissance aircraft No.5) was built based on the BQM-34. A modified Tu-4 (series number 225008, Red 4134) with turboprop engines was converted into a drone carrier platform. The red 4131 drone platform is capable carry two Changhong-1s under the pylons mounted underwing. It can also carry two La-17K UAV.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=tu_4_china Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/315758-tupolev-tu-4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Tupolev}}\n{{China bombers}}"}}
