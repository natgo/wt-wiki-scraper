In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe Typhoon is a heavily armed, fast fighter bomber which excels in Boom and Zoom tactics. It is armed with four deadly Hispano cannons, which can obliterate enemy fighters with the air targets belt. With all modules purchased, the Typhoon is one of the fastest planes in its tier, reaching speeds of almost 700 km/h in level flight. You also have an excellent climb rate and great manoeuvrability, enabling you to dogfight quite effectively against some targets.\n\nYou also get some decent payload options. A choice of 2 x 250, 500 or 1000 lb bombs or 8 x RP-3 rockets allow you to hit enemy ground targets hard and fast. Just beware that carrying such payloads will adversely affect your flight characteristics. In realistic battles ground forces, it is best to assess the situation on the battlefield. If the enemy team is ground forces heavy, you can choose to thin them out with bombs or rockets. You can even use your cannons to good effect on light targets like the Wirbelwind and PT-76. If the enemy team has a high volume of aircraft in the air, leave the payload and just focus on taking them out.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->\nThe Typhoon Mk Ib/L, like the other Typhoons, is a superb altitude fighter, able to dive down on unaware enemies and strike; then take off with the speed it gained from diving to gain a high altitude for the purpose of either doing a second pass on an enemy or to engage a new enemy target. It has a great speed for a 4.3/4.7(RB/AB) but its insufficient climbing speed makes it possible for enemy threats to outclimb it.\n\nMajor threats to the Typhoon Mk Ib/L are aircraft like [[Yak-3]], [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109's]], [[A7M (Family)|A7M]] and [[P-38L-5-LO]] which are able to outclimb, turn faster, and keep up or outrun the Typhoon, making them deadly enemies for it to face. However, the strong structure of the Typhoon's wings make it able to outdive most of them to get away. \n\nIn Arcade battles, the 4 x 20 mm are effective against most aircraft and with boost of speed and climb rate, it is able to climb high and it will be easier to do \"hit and run\" tactics where it will shine most. Engaging enemies in dogfights are not the strong suit of the Typhoon and it is ill advised to do so in any battle mode.\n\nIn Realistic battles, it is an excellent Boom and Zoomer, able to get high altitude and dive on unsuspecting pilots. The climbing speed is sufficient to make it outclimb and do well as a Hit and Run aircraft in lower rating battles, but in higher rating battles it will have fierce competition in the sky.\n\nThe Typhoon is also an excellent option to take into Ground Battles, being able to carry 2 x 1,000 lbs, 2 x 500 lbs, 2 x 250 lbs or 8 x [[RP-3]] rockets into battle, making it capable to assist and support ground units in battle, Also 4 x 20 mm with ground target ammunition can strafe at right angles to immobilize or do critical damage to most enemy tanks from above, buying time and protecting allied ground units from potential threats.  \n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Typhoon fighters of the first production series were equipped with a canopy with massive framing and a Rover-produced car-type side door for cockpit access. The first modification of this was to replace some of the solid metal fairings with transparent panels and cut down the pilot's head armour plate to help increase visibility. Lack of visibility remained a significant problem and whilst a new canopy was being developed, the bulky radio mast and its fairing were replaced with a whip aerial further aft along the fuselage. A new drop-shaped canopy was designed for the pilot's cockpit, providing a good all-round view. The new canopies were fitted on the production aircraft from September 1943 on.\n\nThe fighters were equipped with more powerful 2,200 hp Napier Sabre Mk.IIB and 2,260 hp Napier Sabre Mk.IIC engines, as well as new four-bladed de Havilland propellers. The wing-mounted armament consisted of four 20 mm British Hispano Mk.II belt-fed cannons with 140 rounds per gun. The projecting cannon barrels were equipped with fairings to reduce drag.\n\nBy the end of 1943, these improvements had been implemented on the majority of the Typhoons already in service.\n\nBy the time these later Mk IBs were in service, the aircraft's shortcomings as a fighter had been identified, but it coped perfectly in the role of a fighter-bomber and a close air-support aircraft, striking German airfields, communication lines, railways, and ships.\n\nSince Typhoons were flown at low altitudes under strong enemy anti-aircraft fire, the designers paid great attention to protecting the pilot and the aircraft's vital systems. The pilot's head and back were protected with an armoured backrest and a 38-mm-thick armoured glass windscreen. An armour plate protecting the engine was fitted behind the propeller fairing.\n\nAfter many early teething problems, critical failures and threats to be withdrawn from service altogether, the Typhoon finally found its niche as a rugged, dependable ground attack aircraft. It achieved notoriety amongst German soldiers during the Normandy campaign when, whilst Spitfires were achieving air superiority, the Typhoons were able to cause mayhem amongst German ground units. The Typhoon's production was discontinued in November 1945, and it was withdrawn from service in early 1947. All in all, 3,205 Hawker Typhoon Mk.IB aircraft were produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=fighter&vehicle=typhoon_mk1b_late Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|SwVkOjFkbGo|'''Decision Making /// Typhoon Mk IB / L 8 Kill''' - ''DEFYN''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Hawker}}\n{{Britain fighters}}"}}
