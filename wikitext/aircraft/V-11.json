{"title":"V-11","pageid":12985,"wikitext":{"*":"{{Specs-Card\n|code=v_11g\n|images={{Specs-Card-Image|GarageImage_{{PAGENAME}}.jpg}}\n}}\n\n== Description ==\n<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Hot Tracks\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nDespite its large size, the V-11 is decent at turning although it is outshone by the many biplanes it faces. The acceleration and climb of this aircraft is poor, and is usually an easy prey for any interested fighter. With the use of landing flaps, the plane can enter speeds as low as 120 km/h without stalling, which can be used to stall trap potential enemies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,084 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Realistic Battles'''\n\nAs with all strike aircraft, the V-11 gets an attacker air spawn. This should be used to avoid any confrontations. The speed and climb of this plane is poor, keeping altitude is important in order to avoid enemy fighters. Wait for friendly fighters to arrive to the scene before deciding to engage ground targets. Bombs can be used to damage bases or to destroy light pillboxes.\n\nYou can also use this aircraft to catch out any unwary enemy fighters. The 4 x 7.62 mm Browning machine guns are adequate to take down enemy aircraft. Only engage if you have an altitude advantage as fleeing in this slow aircraft may be difficult. Some fighters such as the [[Bf 109 B-1|Bf 109 B]] can be outmanoeuvred, using the combat flaps. However, it is recommended to try to preserve your speed unless the area is clear of any potential enemies.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

The USAAF bought a few of them, reinforced its airframe and used them for evaluation as the YA-19, which proved to be inferior to twin-engine attackers and thus these aircrafts were soon transferred to the Panama. In the mean time, V-11s that were based on the reinforced YA-19 were sold to 4 other countries: Brazil, Turkey, USSR and the Republic of China.\n\nThe newly reorganized Republic of China Air Force was in need for attackers in view to modernize the air force, an order of 30 V-11Gs was placed in 1935 and 29 of them would be assembled in China by the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (中央杭州飛機製造廠 at Hangzhou, Zhejiang; currently PLAAF Jianqiao Airbase) or by Shiuchow Aircraft Manufacturing Factory (韶關飛機製造廠 at Shaoguan, Guangdong); these aircrafts were handed to the \"International Regiment 國際中隊\" during the 2nd Sino-Japanese War for operation and was first used to bomb the then occupied Japanese airfield at Bengbu, Shandong (山東蚌埠) in early February, 1938; later in the same month, the regiment bombed train stations and airfield occupied by the Japanese forces again; both attack runs have no recorded losses.\n\nAs the Japanese got the upper hand on the war, these aircrafts were then transferred to the rear and after a mountain crash of such type of aircraft, the V-11s and the later V-12s were soon downgraded as liaison aircrafts or trainers until late 1940 when all of them were dismantled.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=v_11g Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|K8-e3Z_o5_I|'''Spade Review.
