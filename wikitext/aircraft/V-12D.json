{"title":"V-12D","pageid":16808,"wikitext":{"*":"{{Specs-Card\n|code=v_12d\n|images={{Specs-Card-Image|GarageImage_{{PAGENAME}}.jpg}}\n}}\n\n== Description ==\n<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of and the creation and combat usage of the aircraft, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Ground Breaking\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nDespite its large size, the V-12D is decent at turning although it is outshone by the many biplanes it faces. The acceleration and climb of this aircraft is poor, and is usually an easy prey for any interested fighter. With the use of landing flaps, the plane can enter speeds as low as 120 km/h without stalling, which can be used to stall-trap potential enemies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,900 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nDue to the design of V-12D is still the same as its predecessor V-11 (which was a single engine airliner), the aircraft has no extra protection against anything, meaning that V-12D should avoid heated battlefield or area covered by SPAAGs. But one good news is that the fuel tanks are all self-sealing tanks so it might potentially save your day from burning into a pile of scrap.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nV-12D is a slight upgrade over the previous V-11, sharing a very similar flight performance. It is labelled as an attacker (strike aircraft) as well so it will have an air respawn. For most of the time, avoid dogfights and keep away from SPAAGs to maximize the odds of survival. For self-defense, the dead-angle under the belly is now covered by another .30 M1919 machine gun. But in dire, its average turn rate is still sufficient to do last-ditch dogfights against heavy interceptors. With a pair of AN/M2 .50 machine gun, it can shoot down most aircraft it might face and strafe open-topped or lightly-armoured ground targets (which are common at its rank).\n\nThe only two option of loadouts are single 500 pound AN-M64 bomb or a pair of 250 pound AN-M63 bombs, allowing a choice between a higher yield \"one-hit knock-out\" bomb or the availability of a \"fail-safe\" second bomb. Although the bomb payload seems insufficient and requires precise hits over the target to score a kill, they are still viable to bomb interwar or early WWII tanks with relatively ease.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* 1 x 500 lb or 2 x 250 lb bombload is adequate against ground units\n* 2 x nose-mounted 12.7mm MG is sufficient for self-defence against fighters such as [[Ki-43 (Family)|Ki-43]]\n* 2 x 250 lb bombs drop separately, allowing 2 passes though better aim is required\n* Has ventral and dorsal turrets allowing it to fend off some attackers behind it\n* Turns decently with combat/takeoff flaps\n* Good over-the-nose view, beneficial in simulator battles\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Bombload is quite lacklustre for a ground attacker\n* Low speed, will easily get caught by fighters like [[Bf 109 F-2|Bf 109 F]], [[Ki-44 (Family)|Ki-44]], [[Yak-1 (Family)|YaK-1]]\n* Slow roll rate\n* Turrets with 7.62 mm guns are not potent enough to damage robust targets like [[Ju 87 (Family)|Ju 87]], [[Bf 110 (Family)|Bf 110]]\n* Rather poor survivability when tailed\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.

After the CAMCO retreated from their home airfield Hangzhou Jianqiao Airfield, some parts of the remaining aircrafts were then transferred to Bangalore in India for further assembly by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.\n\nDue to the capture of Yunnan by Japanese forces, the remaining parts that weren't able to transfer or assemble were lost in history and no further records could show the fate of those parts and aircrafts.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=v_12d Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7369-development-v-12d-smooth-start-en|[Devblog] V-12D: Smooth Start]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/538754-vultee-v-12-d/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vultee}}\n{{China twin-engine fighters and strike aircraft}}"}}
