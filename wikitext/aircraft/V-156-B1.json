In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. \n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is an export version of the American bomber [[SB2U (Family)|SB2U]], various modifications of which were released from 1936-1941. Since 1941 the {{PAGENAME}} was transferred to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease program in World War II. The most important difference between [[SB2U-2]] and {{PAGENAME}} is the armament. The {{PAGENAME}} has 4 x 7.7mm Machine guns , while the [[SB2U-2]] has 2 x 12.7. Due to the small number of such aircraft, they were not actively used in combat operations. Most of them was used as a training aircraft. The last aircraft was withdrawn from service in Great Britain in 1944.\n\n[[File:V-156-B1 Bombing Run.jpg|left|thumb|{{PAGENAME}} diving with its payload.]]\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is a slow, but well-armed bomber. Due to the weak engine, which is not enough for such large two-seater bomber, its speed qualities are quite low. The aircraft has good armament that allows it to perform its tasks. Four offensive-mounted Brownings and one more as a defensive weapon that allows the {{PAGENAME}} to attack most opponents on this BR. The  {{PAGENAME}}  has good bomb armament, which allows it to attack ground targets. Dive bombers are hard to use against ground vehicles in realistic battles, but with practice it gets easier.\n\nA total of 49 {{PAGENAME}} were produced.\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\n\n* 9.5 mm Steel plate between cockpit and turret\n* 3 mm Steel boxes behind the gunner\n* Self-sealing fuel tank located behind pilot\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nWeaponry upgrades and engine should be prioritized with this aircraft, due to its role as an attacker. Its two primary roles are lugging bombs where they need to be in the minimal amount of time possible and then using them to inflict maximum damage. The FSBC mk.5 gives quite an upgrade to the aircraft, replacing the 100 lb bombs (mediocre at best) with the more powerful 250 lb bombs. However, the FLBC mk 1 is a novelty, at best, and only really useful when lugging bombs onto bases in Operation mode in RB. However, the V-156-B1 is a ''very'' bad choice for such a role, and thus, it should be disregarded.\n\nA good research pathway is FSBC mk.5 --> Offensive 7 mm Belts --> New 7 mm MGs --> Defensive 7 mm Belts --> Engine --> New 7 mm MGs (Turret) --> Engine Injection. Anything after that is fair game. However, the FLBC mk.1 should be left until last, due to its uselessness in battles.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any. Describe how effective the cannons and machine guns are in a battle, and also what belts or drums are better to use. If there is no offensive weaponry, delete this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Browning (7.7 mm)}}\n[[File:V-156-B1 attack BB-1.png|thumb|'''{{PAGENAME}}''' vs [[BB-1]] in frontal attack]]\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is armed with:\n\n* 4 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns, wing-mounted (1,000 rpg = 4,000 total). \n\nReally good armament for a bomber. This weapon is enough to successfully destroy enemy aircraft in frontal attacks. The most effective belts are ''Universal'' and ''Stealth''.\n\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|AN-M30A1 (100 lb)|AN-M57 (250 lb)|AN-M64A1 (500 lb)|AN-M65A1 (1,000 lb)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* 1 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bomb + 2 x 100 lb AN-M30A1 bombs (700 lb total)\n* 1 x 500 lb AN-M64A1 bomb + 2 x 250 lb AN-M57 bombs (1,000 lb total)\n* 1 x 1,000 lb AN-M65A1 bomb (1,000 lb total)\n\nWing-mounted bombs (100 lb and 200 lb bombs) are dropped together, so keep that in mind when planning your ground attack. The best loadout for ground attack is the \"250 lb x2, 500 lb\" due to having two bomb drop opportunities with more payload than the two 100 lb AN-M30A1 set-up.\n\nFor base-bombing, the \"100 lb x2, 500 lb\" set-up is capable of destroying 70% of the base, while the \"250 lb x2, 500 lb\" and \"1000 lb\" set-up is capable of destroying one base. \n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Browning (7.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 7.7 mm Browning machine gun, dorsal turret (600 rpg). \n\nA standard defensive armament normally seen at the battle-rating, the one machine gun allows pilot some self-defense opportunities to destroy pursuing aircraft. The most effective belt is ''Universal''. \n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe V-156-B1 is easily one of the more powerful aircraft in the lower battle ratings and can be an absolute monster at low battle rated arcade matches due to its monoplane design, payload, and a large number of offensive machine guns. It is adequate for grinding at low ranks due to its low repair cost and versatility. It can gladly function as both a fighter and an attacker, and once dumping bombs, is capable of Boom & Zooming enemies in the vicinity. In addition, it has airbrakes in the form of dive brakes, which come in useful when landing, attacking ground targets or attempting to shake off an enemy. Although you have a turret, you should not rely on it to be able to destroy fighters on its own - it is good at fending off fighters and keeping newer and/or more cautious players at bay, but it will only be able to shoot down fighters on its own by sheer luck. Your frontal armament, however, is more powerful - and with the usage of airbrakes at critical moments in the fight, such as when the enemy is close to you and approaching from the rear, you can use your airbrakes while reducing your throttle to zero to induce what is known as an 'overshoot'- forcing the enemy behind you to zoom over you instead of staying on your tail by means of a sudden speed decrease. This puts the enemy in front of you and allows you to use your four frontal machine guns to shoot down the lightly-armoured enemies you face at this battle rating.\n\nArcade Ground Strike maps - where the aim is to destroy the enemy's ground troops, and often, dogfights happen over ground targets at low altitudes - are where this aircraft will excel most. A suggested strategy is to use the aircraft as a dive-bomber in arcade battles, using your superior altitude and therefore speed advantages (you start in the bomber spawn) to hit ground targets before zooming back towards friendlies, or waiting until the fighters have started engaging, and then attack ground targets. The aircraft (at stock payload) has two 100 lb bombs and one 500 lb bomb. At these low BRs, your bombs will annihilate enemy armoured car and AAA formations, and your guns are nigh-upon-unstoppable at this BR. Use \"Universal\" or \"Tracer\" belts for best effect.\n\nWhile waiting for payload reload, go for enemy planes. British, German and Japanese aircraft are particularly vulnerable to your attacks due to their relatively low armament in a head-on engagement and lack of any and all armour protection. Soviet biplanes (the I-15s) will have heavier or equal armament, and American monoplanes will be harder to kill than biplanes due to robust construction and having similar speeds. At a BR of 1.3, the best opposition you will face are P-40s, Bf-109E-1s, Ki-43s and H-75s. All of these aircraft have large amounts of machine guns with exhaustive ammo pools, and if they can catch up to you, you're likely going to be shot down by the opposition, since you don't have the performance to fight them without assistance. If you feel lucky, you can duke it out by baiting them into a turn fight, where your good turn radius with landing flaps active can make you the victor in the situation. Never rely upon your single rear gun to keep you safe- at best it can only really function as a deterrent to keep fighters at bay. Always keep an eye on your six, and when you finish a ground attack run, look around and see if anything's coming before you go in again. If you see a fighter coming for you and can manage to turn towards them enough that you can get a firing solution on them, you can probably win. British 7.7 mm guns are among the best in the game in terms of raw fire chance values and penetration, and if loaded with the \"Tracer\" belt- a full mix of Incendiary Tracer (essentially a standard incendiary bullet with a tracer element) and Armour-Piercing Incendiary (Usually the most damaging type of bullet in any given gun) in 50% proportion to each other- they can shred through any air target at a battle rating of 1.3.\n\nA suggested loadout is a minimum load of fuel (33 minutes, more than enough for arcade battles or realistic battles), Universal or Tracer <!--why use these belts - expand here, help new players understand why they are superior to Default or Stealth--> 7 mm belts on both defensive and offensive 7 mm guns (maximal AP-I ammunition) and the payload of 2 x 250 lb bombs and 1 x 500 lb bomb.\n\n===Manual Engine Control===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Initial delivery was delayed as the SBU was in production for the US Marine Corps. Delivery was planned for March 1941, the delay due to ongoing production orders for the United States Marine Corps, but the fall of France in June 1940 caused the order to be shifted to the UK. In the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm (FAA), the V-156-B1 was known as the Chesapeake Mk.I. The first Chesapeake flew on February 26, 1941, and by the end of March, the British had accepted the V-156-B1.\n\nIn British service, the V-156-B1 was intended for anti-submarine patrols, but it became apparent that the aircraft lacked the performance to carry the ordnance necessary for that role, causing the British officials relegating to defensive roles such as carrier escort tasks. Eventually, they were removed from frontline service and used as a training aircraft until the Fairey Swordfish replaced it in that role.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=v_156_b1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n'''Other planes in the V-156 Family:'''\n\n* [[V-156-F]]\n* [[SB2U-2]]\n* [[SB2U-3]]\n\n'''Equivalents in other nations' trees:'''\n\n* [[Ju 87 B-2]]\n* [[Ju 87 R-2 (Italy)]]\n* [[Hs 123 A-1]]\n* [[Hs 123 A-1 (China)]]\n* [[D3A1]]\n* [[B5N2]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/392578-sb2u-v-156/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vought}}\n{{Britain bombers}}"}}
