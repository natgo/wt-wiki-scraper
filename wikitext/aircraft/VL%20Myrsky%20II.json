Despite it being clear that the demand for new aircraft couldn’t be met by the limited Finnish aviation industry, the military nonetheless issued a set of requirements to the State Aircraft Factory in order to come up with a new design in early 1939.\n\nThe prototype, named Myrsky (Finn. for \"Storm\"), made her maiden flight in December 1941, after which started a long program of correcting identified issues. In the fall of 1942, serial production of the fighter began, with the main problems of the original version solved - the aircraft in serial production were designated Myrsky II. By the time the batch production was completed, the flight and combat qualities of the fighter were no longer satisfied with the military. The Myrsky II shortly served in the final stages of the war and was decommissioned in 1947. Including prototypes, a total of 51 Myrsky IIs were built.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=vl_myrsky_2_late Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"200\">\nVL_Myrsky_II_WTWallpaper001.jpg\nVL_Myrsky_II_WTWallpaper002.jpg\nVL_Myrsky_II_WTWallpaper003.jpg\nVL_Myrsky_II_WTWallpaper004.jpg\nVL_Myrsky_II_WTWallpaper005.jpg\nVL_Myrsky_II_WTWallpaper006.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Z_k79HQ5FaU|'''Nightmarish rudder!
