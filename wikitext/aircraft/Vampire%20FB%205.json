Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nWhen using the Vampire, the first thing a pilot should know is that it is inferior in most aspects to its opposition, thus requiring constant vigilance and consciousness of weakness. The Vampire cannot reach the speeds a [[MiG-9 (l)]] or an [[F2H-2]] can, it cannot accelerate as well as many of its counterparts and it is appalling in a dive against most of its opponents. So, essentially, the \"Vamp\" cannot climb well, it can't catch many jets in a straight line and it can't out-accelerate much of its opposition. However, the Vampire has one impressive advantage against its jet-powered opponents: it can turn incredibly well. In fact, a good analogy to flying the Vampire is fighting jets in propeller aircraft.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,572 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

As with most jets, damage to the wings or fuselage greatly hampers flight performance, decreasing top speed and manoeuvrability. There are quite a few fuel tanks located in this plane's wings, so fuel fires may be common, especially when taking a high fuel loadout.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Vampire is well-known for its ability to turn on a dime, but its incredible manoeuvrability also means that it has poor manoeuvring energy retention. Climbing is important for this plane, as is careful airspeed maintenance. When in a battle situation, it is advisable to always stay above 400 km/h; any slower, and the Vampire will greatly struggle to evade enemy fire.\n\nIf the Vampire is able to keep its energy, it becomes one of the best dogfighters at this rank. It can outturn nearly every other jet of its tier, and has a powerful engine to boot. Thanks to its great manoeuvrability, it is often quite easy to line up a shot against the enemy. One common tactic is to try luring the enemy into a turnfight. The Vampire will almost always come out on top. However, never commit to a dogfight if there are multiple enemies nearby. Turning will cause the Vampire's airspeed to fall dramatically, at which point enemies can easily swoop in and destroy it.\n\nIt is valuable to note that the Vampire has a low top speed for a jet, at only ~880 km/h. It also tends to compress as higher speeds. The Vampire may have difficulty in chasing down a faster enemy. Also note that firing the main cannon armament causes a downward recoil.\n\nFor attacking ground targets, the Vampire can be equipped with either bombs or rockets.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

Designed to Air Ministry specification F.6/41, the demand was for a fighter with a maximum speed in excess of 500 mph and a combat radius of at least 300 miles. The twin tail boom layout design allowed a short tailpipe from the powerplant, a de Havilland Goblin centrifugal turbojet. This limited the loss of thrust and reduced overall weight. Also of note in the design was the use of plywood and balsa wood in the construction of the cockpit section; de Havilland already had experience of using wood in the construction of high performance aircraft.\n\nPreliminary flight testing in September 1943 proved to be a success, with modifications made to the rudder to reduce drag and increase stability. The third prototype aircraft was also fitted with the planned standard armament of four 20mm Hispano cannon. In May 1944 an order for 120 aircraft was placed, and the first production Vampire F.Mk.I made its maiden flight in April 1945; the Vampire briefly held the record as the fastest British jet fighter with a top speed of 540 mph. No.247 Squadron was the first unit to be equipped with the Vampire in March 1946, shortly followed by No.54 and No.72 Squadrons to form the first Vampire Wing at RAF Chilbolton. In 1948 Vampires were employed by the 2nd Tactical Air Force based in Germany. A specially modified Vampire again hit the record books when it achieved a world altitude record of 59,446 feet.\n\n1948 also saw the first testing of the FB.Mk.5. This was initially a modified Vampire F.3 with a strengthened and clipped wing, increased armour and greater ground clearance for the carrying of external ordnance. This fighter-bomber variant of the Vampire was capable of carrying up to 2000 lbs of bombs or 60 lb rockets, and went on to equip 40 squadrons within the RAF as well as being the first RAF jets to operate in the Far East. The Vampire FB.Mk.5 was used operationally in ground attack missions against insurgents in Malaya until it was replaced by the Venom in 1953. The FB.Mk.5 was also used as the basis for the Royal Navy's Sea Vampire F.Mk.20 which, fitted with an arrestor hook, long travel landing gear and larger wing flaps, entered service with the Fleet Air Arm in June 1949. A popular export fighter, just under 3300 Vampires were built - many under license overseas.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=vampire_fb5 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|rpvKhy22Erc|'''The Shooting Range #85''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 08:59 discusses the Vampire FB 5.|ghlDnZShfzE|'''Dogfights: Me 262 vs Vampire FB 5''' - ''Azi''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/262866-de-havilland-vampire-fb5/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer deHavilland}}\n{{Britain jet aircraft}}"}}
