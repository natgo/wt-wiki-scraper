In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]]. It is the first jet in the Italian tree's export fighter line, and is placed after the [[Re.2005 serie 0]]. It is followed by the rank VI fighter, the [[CL-13 Mk.4]]. The Vampire FB 52A is an export version of the British Vampire FB 6, itself an upgraded version of the [[Vampire FB 5]] with an improved engine.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe Vampire cannot reach the speeds a [[MiG-9 (l)]] or an [[F2H-2]] can, it cannot accelerate as well as many of its counterparts, and it is appalling in a dive against most of its opponents. However, the Vampire has one impressive advantage against its jet-powered opponents: it can turn incredibly well. In fact, a good analogy to flying the Vampire is fighting jets in propeller aircraft.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,572 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

As with most jets, damage to the wings or fuselage greatly hampers flight performance, decreasing top speed and manoeuvrability. There are quite a few fuel tanks located in this plane's wings, so fuel fires may be common, especially when taking a high fuel loadout.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Vampire is well-known for its ability to turn on a dime, but its incredible manoeuvrability also means that it has poor manoeuvring energy retention. Climbing is important for this plane, as is careful airspeed maintenance. When in a battle situation, it is advisable to always stay above 400 km/h; any slower, and the Vampire will greatly struggle to evade enemy fire.\n\nIf the Vampire is able to keep its energy, it becomes one of the best dogfighters at this rank. It can outturn nearly every other jet of its tier, and has a powerful engine to boot. Thanks to its great manoeuvrability, it is often quite easy to line up a shot against the enemy. One common tactic is to try luring the enemy into a turnfight. The Vampire will almost always come out on top. However, never commit to a dogfight if there are multiple enemies nearby. Turning will cause the Vampire's airspeed to fall dramatically, at which point enemies can easily swoop in and destroy it.\n\nIt is valuable to note that the Vampire has a low top speed for a jet, at only ~880 km/h. It also tends to compress as higher speeds. The Vampire may have difficulty in chasing down a faster enemy. Also note that firing the main cannon armament causes a downward recoil.\n\nFor attacking ground targets, the Vampire can be equipped with either bombs or rockets.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

Its development began in 1941 and the design boasted several novel features. It was powered by a single turbojet engine in contrast to the twin engined [[Meteor (Family)|Gloster Meteor]] due to the availability of more powerful engines; most production Vampires were powered by the Goblin engine, also manufactured by the de Havilland company. The twin-boom tail design allowed the fuselage to be kept short, reducing the length of the jet pipe and maximizing the amount of effective thrust by minimizing energy losses from friction. The air intakes were also located in the wing roots as opposed to directly in front of the engine. The fuselage was largely constructed of balsa wood as on the [[Mosquito (Family)|de Havilland Mosquito]]. While the Vampire first flew only months after the Meteor in 1943, it arrived too late to see combat in World War II. In Royal Air Force service, the initial Vampire F.1 variant replaced propeller fighters. Later fighter-bomber versions under the \"FB\" designation were capable of serving ground attack roles, leaving air defence to the better suited Meteor. While the Vampire was not an impressive jet aircraft in terms of speed, climb rate, or range, it was agile and easy to handle. It would ultimately equip 33 air forces over more than 30 years of service. The RAF retired the Vampire from combat roles in 1954 but retained the trainer variants until 1971. The design was developed further into the [[Venom FB.4|de Havilland Venom]], which had a new engine and wing.\n\nThe Vampire FB.52 was an export version of the Vampire FB.6, which itself was sold to and license produced by Switzerland. Compared to the preceding [[Vampire FB 5|FB.5]], the FB.6 had a new Goblin 3 engine offering about 1.1 kN/112 kgf of extra thrust over the Goblin 2. The basic FB.52 was exported to Norway, New Zealand, and other operators. The '''Vampire FB.52A''' was a subvariant for Italy with minor differences. According to one source, the Italian Air Force received 51 FB.52As from Britain in 1950, and 195 subsequent aircraft were manufactured locally by Fiat and Macchi. Other sources differ on the production numbers. A considerable number of FB.52As were delivered by Italy to Egypt and possibly Syria from 1955-56.\n\nThe Vampire's service in Italian hands was uneventful. They were retired by 1960, being replaced by the [[F-84G-21-RE (Italy)|F-84 Thunderjet]] and other aircraft. The Egyptian Air Force used its Vampires, largely consisting of FB.52s and FB.52As, in conflicts with Israel. Several were lost to Israeli Meteors and many were destroyed during the invasion of the Suez Canal in 1956. Afterwards, the Vampires were retired and replaced with Soviet aircraft.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=vampire_fb52a_italy Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|x0hdzQKCiFE|'''The Shooting Range #266''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:26 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|zn2uhgI2PPg|'''Best twin-boom aircraft''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 05:18 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|KdwQodKUuQM|'''This is One Fun Jet!''' - ''WhooptieDo''|LVeioHQqecU|'''When Italians get their hands on [sic] British jet''' - ''HowToPlay1337''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Vampire FB 5]]: An equivalent in the British tech tree\n* [[J28B]]: An equivalent in the Swedish tech tree\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://www.baesystems.com/en/heritage/de-havilland-vampire BAE Systems: de Havilland Vampire]\n* [[wikipedia:De_Havilland_Vampire|[Wikipedia] de Havilland Vampire]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/367126-fiat-fb52a-vampire/ Official forums: suggestion page]\n\n{{AirManufacturer deHavilland}}\n{{Italy jet aircraft}}"}}
