It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 \"Locked On\"]] as a [[wt:/en/news/6072-shop-update-1-87-pre-orders-en|premium pack]] in the Gaijin store and was removed from the store with the introduction of the [[Update \"Winged Lions\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe Vautour has decent manoeuvrability (for a bomber), but you shouldn't be turning with anything to begin with. Where this plane really shines is the acceleration owing to the two powerful engines in the underling nacelles and the heavy air frame. Which makes it amazing in the vertical. But since you can't have everything, the wings will break in prolonged >7g manoeuvres. Essentially you don't want to do any insane manoeuvres, and risk getting sent back to the hanger.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n# The regular \"rush the base and run away\" style that all Jet bombers can do and excel at. There's nothing wrong with this, but it's not where the Vautour excels.\n# Ignore all the other payloads and load up on missiles. This arguably the more interesting way to play, but there are risks involved as well. i.e. having the whole enemy team pick the Vautour as a priority target.\n\nIf you take the missiles, here's how you want to play it:\n\nLook for high altitude dots , these usually mean other jet bombers or the odd Tu-4. The missiles are not that effective at a range greater then 1 km. The farther that missiles are fired, the greater the chance of the locked-on enemy have in evading the missile. On the off hand that the first missile misses, the Vautour has four of them so a follow-up shot is an encouraged option.\n\nOnce in a while, look around and support your team, especially the teammates that are engaging the enemy. If an ally has an enemy at their tail, work around towards the enemy's rear and fire off a missile to take care of them. This can be beneficial if a long chain of alternating enemy and ally fighters have gotten together as each of them try to hit the fighter at their front and evade the fighter at their tail. If able to pounce on these chains, come in from the very rear and take out the very last enemy fighter in this chain. This will either cause the chain to break-up, potentially freeing up pressure on your allies, or the chain will continue without noticing the Vautour's presence. In the latter case, continue towards the next enemy and take them out one-by-one.\n\nOnce all missiles are expended, switch to the guns, which are powerful enough to take care of any enemies unfortunate to be in front of them. However, high-speeds will cause the controls to be less responsive, so fine-manoeuvring for these gun-runs may be difficult. If the gun pass misses, itch up and use the Vautour's amazing vertical energy retention to reset and try again. Usually the guns don't get much use as the missiles will completely over shadow them.\n\nOverall this plane destroys people who don't pay attention and or make bad plays. The most effective way to lock it down is to simply look back every now and then, just to make sure nothing's behind you.\n\n;Enemies of note:\n\nF-100's: These things will out speed you and outmanoeuvre you in the vertical. If one happens to latch onto your 6, drag him away from his friends and force him to overshoot. Then assuming the reversal was successful, throw a missile at them. Most F-100 may not be aware that the Vautour has missiles, and so firing off a missile can destroy the F-100 while it is supersonic.\n\nVautours: The Vautour's great performance means its greatest enemy is going to be itself. Be especially wary on maps like Hokkaido where there's thick cloud cover. They have a tendency to come out of nowhere, destroy you and retreat back into the cloud cover like some air-borne monster.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
