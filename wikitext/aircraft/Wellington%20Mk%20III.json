Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n====Air battles====\nIn Air Battles, the winning tactic is to climb high and bomb your targets. If you don't want to climb the {{PAGENAME}}, is a great low flying bomber, offering great speed and manoeuvrability. However, it lacks any armour and only offers limited protection with turrets in the front, side and rear. It lacks armour plates, unlike other bombers of the other nations. A few well placed shots will see {{PAGENAME}}, getting torn apart to any aircraft which drop down to engage it from the top or belly. However, its rear gun turret offers four 7.7 mm machine guns which are able to shoot down the enemy aircraft with a few well placed shots.\n\n====Ground battles====\n[[File:Wellington Torp Launching technic.jpg|thumb|right|364x364px|\"Torpedo attack!\" The best way to launch a torpedo at close range without sacrificing the aircraft, is to find the middle ground between the suggested drop direction and the target. That way making the evasive action of the torpedoes, harder. Whether the target slows down or turns, The torpedoes will be on collision course]]\nUsing the {{PAGENAME}} should be used as a strategic bomber, that is what it excels at in this game mode. It is too big to be used in the ground attack role, making it an easy target for enemy tankers. To use the {{PAGENAME}}, load up on 500 lbs or the single 4,000 lbs cookie bomb. The 500 lbs, offer 65.5 Kg of HE filler and the cookie offers 1,339 kg of explosive filler.\n\nFly around the map, waiting for the enemy to cap the cap zones, when they start capping the zone - head towards it while gaining altitude. Do not come in low as a single shot fired from a tank can knock you out of the game. Once at a good height, line up on the cap zone and drop the bombs. Any tank in the zone will be destroyed.\n\n==== Naval battles ====\nAll of the Wellington bombers are well suited for the naval warfare, The {{PAGENAME}} being one of the best of them provides improved Browning turrets, highest top speed of them all and two supreme payloads that will allow you to change the tides of a naval war in both Arcade and Realistic battles.\n\nThose are:\n\n* 2 х 18 inch Mark XII torpedoes\n* 1 x 4,000 lb H.C. 4,000 lb Mk.II bomb\n\nWith the torpedoes, the strategy goes in finding a good approach angle to successfully deliver both torpedoes to preferably gunboats and destroyers as they will have a tougher time evading them. Beware of anti-aircraft fire and swiftly turn back to safety while preparing the next drop.\n\nThe technique at the moment of launching the torpedoes is shown in the image: \"Torpedo attack!\"\n\nUsing the 4,000 lb bomb, the scenario takes place a bit higher. Way above the enemies' short and medium anti-aircraft guns that reach around 3,000 - 4,500 m altitude. Here you will be able to spot the biggest of the fishes. Those will be your targets and with some developed practice in predicting the drops you will decimate the entire enemy destroyers population in a a short time, tanks to this extremely lethal bomb.\n\nJust be alert of enemy planes that will be eager to take you down, using the Armoured targets belt provides some of the boost in defence you need as it cripples engines and pierces through metal.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

In May 1939, a prototype Wellington was fitted with Bristol Hercules engines; after successful trials with a converted Mk.IC, this model was launched for full-scale production at the beginning of 1941 under the designation of Wellington Mk.III (Type 417).\n\nProduction Mk.III aircraft were equipped with two 1,590 hp Bristol Hercules Mk.XI radial, air-cooled engines.\n\nBuilding on the experience amassed by Wellington crews, the defensive armament was upgraded on later models; the Frazer-Nash FN-5A rear turret with two 0.303 inch machine guns was replaced with a Frazer-Nash FN-20 turret holding four 0.303 inch machine guns with 2,000 rounds each. The take-off weight of the Mk.III was increased to 15,650 kg while bomb capacity was reduced to 4,000 lbs (1,814 kg). Originally, the bomber was to be equipped with a ventral turret, the low-drag Frazer-Nash FN-21A, but the further decrease in bomb capacity was deemed to be unacceptable.\n\nThe Mk.III had its armour reinforced, all fuel tanks were self-sealing and barrage balloon cable cutters were positioned in the leading edge of the wings.\n\nBy 1941 the Wellington was used almost exclusively at night and therefore, attention was given to decreasing the area of the glazing that visibly reflected moonlight or searchlight beams during night flights. To that end, the Mk.III differed from the late Mk.IC aircraft by removing side glazing and the side blisters of the bombardier/navigator's cockpit. The only side glazing that remained was from the trapezoidal gun blisters.\n\nThe Wellington Mk.III was manufactured until the end of 1943, and a combined total of 1,519 bombers were produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=wellington_mk3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|RuBjkyZT6Yw|'''The Shooting Range #6''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 00:40 discusses the Vickers Wellington.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Vickers}}\n{{Britain bombers}}"}}
