In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British strike aircraft {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.59 \"Flaming Arrows\"]].\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} can carry great amounts of payload due to its distinctive feature, the turboprop powerplant. This engine enables it to exceed 600 kph in level flight.\n\nThe Wyvern is an aircraft that can carry a large payload so it can be used in the strike fighter role. One of its most popular payloads, 16 x RP-3 , enables it to destroy a large amounts of targets with medium armour like light pillboxes and up to heavy tanks. The Wyvern is also a strong fighter, below 3,000 m. As the Wyvern does not have a compressor of any sorts, engine power drops significantly above 3,000 m. Keeping altitude at 3,000 and doing Boom & Zoom or Boom & Run attacks are of the most successful fighting doctrines. Although the Boom & Zoom attack will most likely bleed the Wyvern's speed very quickly, employing Boom & Run instead of this attack is recommended when possible.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe Wyvern S4, being a turboprop, is an exceptionally fast aircraft for its battle rating. Though a prop aircraft, the Wyvern functions very similar to jet aircraft in play style, due to the nature of its weight and engine. Though the Wyvern does have an above average climb rate due to its powerful engine, it functions best near sea level. At sea level, where the engine functions at maximum capacity, the Wyvern is almost uncatchable. Being able to maintain nearly 640 km/h in level flight without a payload, even enemies diving on the Wyvern will have trouble catching up, and will quickly fall behind as they lose energy.\n\nThough it can go incredibly fast, this is solely due to the aircraft's powerful turboprop engine. Coming in at a heavy 7 tonnes with no payload, or 9 and a half tonnes with its maximum payload, the Wyvern's speed suffers when performing any manoeuvre bar going in a straight line. Even minor adjustments will cause the fighter to bleed speed at an alarming rate, with full-out turns able to halve the aircraft's speed before it has even completed a 180. Whilst it has the speed, the Wyvern can turn very fast but as mentioned it will lose this speed in the turn very quickly. Unless absolutely necessary, avoid performing any but the most gentle of manoeuvres in this 7 tonne beast.\n\nThis focus on simply flying straight is further amplified by the turboprop's ability, or lack thereof, to quickly react to input changes. As happens in jet aircraft, the turboprop engine found on the Wyvern will take a fairly long amount of time to react to changes to the throttle meaning the Wyvern pilot will struggle to regain speed if the throttle is dropped at any point, such as to recover from a vertical stall manoeuvre.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 0 m - sea level)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nSpeed, climb rate, and armament are the Wyvern's only real method of taking out enemy aircraft. These are the strengths that any pilot of the Wyvern should always exploit, by employing Boom & Run tactics on enemies. With four Mk V Hispano cannons, and a staggeringly large ammo reserve, the Wyvern is more than equipped to quickly dispatch any aircraft that end up in front of it. The pilot should only take the plane up to a maximum of a couple thousand meters, unless bomber hunting, and use the Wyvern's excellent acceleration and top speed to quickly annihilate any enemies who end up on low altitude. The Wyvern can also use this speed to bait enemies, who see the Wyvern as an easy target, down to low altitudes. This will allow allied fighters to easily establish high altitude air superiority, which can often end up in victory by itself, without the Wyvern pilot actually putting himself in any great danger.\n\nWith its wide variety of secondary armaments, the Wyvern is one of the best aircraft available to the British at this BR. Typically, load up three 1,000 lb bombs, and use them to fully destroy one bombing point. The Wyvern is taken to its maximum weight whilst carrying this payload, and will only be able to maintain around 550 km/h at sea level, so the pilot should attempt to drop the bombs as soon as he can, to regain the Wyvern's 640 km/h top speed. Using the four Mk V Hispano cannons, preferably with Air Targets ammunition loaded, employ the Wyvern as was detailed in the above section, as a boom-and-zoom aircraft at low altitude. If one had experience flying any jet aircraft in the past, use the Wyvern exactly as a jet. Do not turn for anyone, if a pass misses then continue onward until a great distance is gained, then turn around for another guns run.\n\nWhile fighting, any pilot should refrain from turn fighting and perform energy fighting whenever possible\n\nIn Ground Forces, the pilot has the choice between using three 500 lb bombs, three 1,000 lb bombs, sixteen RP-3 rockets, or sixteen AP Mk I rockets. With such an armament, the Wyvern's distinctive engine sound can signal in the incoming doom of any tank unfortunate enough to end up in the pilot's vision.\n\nIn Naval Battles, the Wyvern can be used as a fighter-bomber. The 3 x 1,000 lb bombs will allow you to destroy most targets with direct hits and once free of the bomb load you are free to kill any other bombers or fighters around with relative ease.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The design was a relic of an era past, with jet-powered aircraft now replacing propeller aircraft. It also suffered from a long development period, beginning in 1944 as the P.10. This lead to the Wyvern seeing very little combat use and being quickly retired. The Wyvern S.4 variant contained an Armstrong Siddeley Python 3 turboprop engine, able to output 3670 horsepower, and was the first and only variant of the Wyvern to enter service with the British Royal Navy.\n\nThe Wyvern S.4 only saw actual combat in late 1956 during the Suez Crisis, racking up 79 sorties and 2 losses. This marked the Wyvern as the only British turboprop to ever see combat.<ref>http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=1482</ref>\n\nThe type was plagued with various engine problems during its brief period in service, and was retired soon after in 1958.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=wyvern_s4 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"150\">\nImage:Westland Wyvern on the runway.jpg|<small>Westland Wyvern on the runway</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|nMwQCST13GM|'''Should You Buy The Wyvern''' - ''Sako Sniper''|Hryh-SLXmU4|'''Premium Vehicles: Wyvern S4''' - ''War Thunder Wiki''|95zYKZDSVjQ|''' Premium Review: Westland Wyvern S4''' - ''Jengar''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/3735-development-westland-wyvern-the-turboprop-dragon-en|[Devblog] Westland Wyvern: The Turboprop Dragon]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/315763-westland-wyvern-s4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{AirManufacturer Westland}}\n{{Britain strike aircraft}}\n{{Britain premium aircraft}}"}}
