In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American twin-engine fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. It was available in the Gaijin Store until it was replaced by the [[YP-38]] in [[Update \"Raining Fire\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nDespite being a heavy twin engine fighter, the XP-38G has a quite good overall performance. Its level speed is comparable to many single-engined fighters and even faster than some of them. It can reach 550 km/h at the sea level and, thanks to its superchargers, the plane's maximum speed is close to 660 km/h at 5,000 m altitude and it doesn't drop or increase up to 11,000 m, that makes it a good medium and high altitude fighter and, in most cases, outperforms the opposition.\n\nClimb rate is comparable to other American fighters, the plane is able to reach 5,000 m in 4 minutes and 40 seconds which is quite mediocre, its climb rate at 1,000 m is close to 18 m/s, but again thanks to the supercharger it will not suffer so much at high altitude. When climbing from 5,000 m alt to 9,000 m alt, it will outperform most other fighters. Acceleration in level flight is decent and when it starts diving it gets very good. It is required to keep an eye on the speed because the maximum structural speed limit is low in this plane compared to how fast it can accelerate.\n\nThe XP-38G's turn rate is quite good but depends a lot on its Fowler flaps, they do increase the lift a lot but the drag too. Sustained turn rate is quite good, better than in almost every other heavy twin-engined fighter, but in most cases only comparable or worse to other fighters. On the other hand, the instantaneous turn rate, especially with deployed flaps, is very good and can help a lot with getting the guns on the target for high deflection shooting. Of course, due to the plane's configuration, it suffers a lot from high speed compression, which starts close to 0.70 Mach. The other issue is its roll rate, at best it reaches 70 degrees per second at 400 km/h. The way the Lighting's engines are set makes it so the pilot does not need to worry about the propeller torque effect, so the plane doesn't require any trimming except for some elevator adjustments to fly in a straight line.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 8,229 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nUtilize the P-38 as a strike fighter. The P-38 has very good energy retention and climb speed, so mainly use it as a BnZ fighter. However, it can be an effective turn fighter against less manoeuvrable opponents. Be warned, however, that once at a low speed and altitude the P-38 is a sitting duck. It is a very large fighter and easy to destroy.\n\nThe best cure is being prepared. Always maintain a high, safe altitude. If you have to, the P-38 is best in a flat dive. Its roll rate can be used to its advantage as well. Use diving and climbing manoeuvres to get out of trouble. Avoid turning to counter opponents, unless they are less manoeuvrable.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The closest equivalent to the games fictional XP-38G is a P-38H (600 built) or a P-38K-1 (1 built), which had a few minor performance improvements to the P-38G.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe P-38 was an all-metal, three-wheeled, single-seater, twin-engined monoplane fighter with an aerodynamic design rarely seen in World War II.\n\nAn experimental XP-38 (Model 22) was first flown on January 27, 1938. Production began in June of 1941.\n\nThe G variant was created at the end of 1942 and was based on the E and F variants. The G had a more powerful turbocharged Allison V-1710-51/55 engine. Engine management was significantly more automated than before.\n\nThe plane carried a formidable armament consisting of 20mm Hispano AN/M2 cannons with 150 rounds and four 12.7mm Colt-Browning M2.5 machine guns with 300 rounds apiece. The P-38G had a reinforced fuselage and could carry two extra 300-gallon (1136-liter) fuel tanks. The G was not equipped to carry rockets and bombs, but was often modified on the field to carry 250-lb or even 500-lb bombs as well as unguided rockets.\n\nThe P-38G was widely used by the Army Air Force (USAAF) in all theaters of the war. They were often used for shuttle missions over Germany from the airfields of Ukraine. The best known operation in which the P-38G participated was Operation Lightning, which changed the war in the Pacific. The mission, which was flown on April 18, 1943, intercepted and shot down a Japanese G4M1 bomber with Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto on board. In addition, the P-38 was the plane of choice of the two most successful American aces: Richard Ira Bong (40 kills) and Thomas McGuire (38 kills).\n\nFrom 1942 to 1943, Lockheed built 1,462 P-38Gs. They were decommissioned in 1949.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=p-38g_metal Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n* Northrop [[P-61C-1|P-61]] Black Widow\n* Savoia-Marchetti [[SM.92]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/56587-lockheed-p-38g-1/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Lockheed}}\n{{USA twin-engine fighters}}\n{{USA premium aircraft}}\n[[Category:Hidden vehicles]]"}}
