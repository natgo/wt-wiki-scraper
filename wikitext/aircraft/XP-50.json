In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game.

Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe XP-50 has great climb rate and acceleration, although it does tend to lock up at high speeds. It can easily maintain a 20-25 degree climb. Your engines will also commonly overheat, but they cool off relatively quickly. Low-speed manoeuvrability is excellent, especially when you have your flaps deployed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,700 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIts excellent climb rate and acceleration make this plane great for energy fighting. It won't be hard to get altitude advantage upon the majority of your opponents, which this plane can out-climb.\n\nUse your climb rate to be the highest plane of the battle, unfortunately, this aircraft does not have WEP, as so, it is best to climb at a 20-25 degree angle to get to altitude. Your priority targets are the highest enemies where you can pick and choose and work your way down to lower aircraft as needed.\n\nIf you notice you were out-climbed, don't hesitate to roll away and climb more as a dive is a risky trade with this plane. If an enemy climbs to catch you, make a 90° climb at full power and when they start to stall, try to boom & zoom them. Use your acceleration and/or climb rate if someone gets on your six to lose them. If you do lose energy, do not worry. You turn extremely well at low speeds with your flaps out and will out turn most things you fight.\n\nMake sure to have a disciplined and accurate fire, since you will quickly chew through the ammunition. While you may only have 120 rounds total of the cannon rounds, it doesn't take a lot of hits to knock out enemy aircraft. Your guns are extremely accurate and they are nose mounted. Gun convergence can safely be set to 800 meters, however, accuracy is best when close in, around 200-300 m. It is recommended to  take ''Air Targets'' ammo for the cannons and Universal ammo for the machine guns to maximize the damage output for air to air engagements.\n\nWhen attacking bombers, try your best to stay away from the rear as that is a very dangerous spot for your aircraft to attack from. The engines can easily be damaged by gunners if the shots are aimed properly so try your best to attack from the top or bottom or even peel off if needed. This aircraft has poor fire extinguishing and flying with one engine can be dangerous. \n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

The prototype was given a company designation of Model G-46 and an army designation of ХР-50.\n\nThe USAAC issued an order for production of the new aircraft on November 25, 1939. Although the ХР-50 was similar to the XF5F-1 externally, a number of significant changes were introduced into the original layout. Unlike its carrier-based predecessor, the ХР-50 was not a low-wing but a mid-wing monoplane, the fuselage was significantly lengthened, the shape of the pilot's cockpit canopy was changed, and the tailplane span was reduced.\n\nThe plane was powered by two Wright XR-1820-67/79 Cyclone nine-cylinder, air-cooled engines, with a left- and right-handed reduction gear, producing a takeoff power of 1,200 hp. Due to the new engines installed, the shape of the nacelles and engine cowlings was changed.\n\nThe aircraft's armament included two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza AN-M2 cannons, with 60 rounds each, and two 12.7 mm Colt-Browning AN-M2.5 machine guns, with 500 rounds each, mounted in the forward fuselage. In addition, the aircraft could carry two 100 lb (45 kg) bombs under its wing panels.\n\nInstead of the XF5F-1's tail wheel, the ХР-50 had a nose landing gear. The plane's fuel tanks were self-sealing, and the pilot was protected just as he was in the Navy version, i. e. with the help of an armored front bulkhead, an armored backrest, and an armored floor.\n\nThe XP-50 (Ser No. 40-3057) prototype got off the ground for the first time on 18 February 1941, with Robert Hall, a Grumman test pilot, at the controls. The test flights showed that the ХР-50 had a better controllability than the XF5F-1. In addition, the turbosupercharged engines ensured the ХР-50's much better characteristics at medium and high altitudes.\n\nOn 14 May 1941, during the 15th test flight of the ХР-50 prototype, the turbosupercharger of one of the engines was destroyed, the cause undetermined, and the turbine blades flying in all directions severed the line running to the hydraulic nose landing gear extension system.\n\nPilot Robert Hall successfully bailed out of the damaged vehicle. After the first prototype was lost, all work on the ХР-50 was discontinued.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=xp-50 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[XF5F]]\n\n;Similar airframe\n\n* [[Ro.57 Quadriarma]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.ru/index.php?/topic/120438-pasport-xp-50/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance (Russian Forum)]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Grumman}}\n{{USA twin-engine fighters}}\n{{USA premium aircraft}}"}}
