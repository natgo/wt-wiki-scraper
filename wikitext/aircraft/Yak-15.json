In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet jet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.31]].\n\nThe Yak-15 is arguably one of the most underestimated planes in the game. Although its statcard reveals what would be considered \"sub-par\" performance and armament, the Yak-15 is both a unique and deadly fighter. Unlike its propeller-driven counterparts, this first generation jet aircraft wields the ability to hold on to energy in a straight line, whereas prop aircraft will slowly lose speed. This coupled with its good rate of turn allows the Yak-15 to defend itself against both propeller and jet-powered aircraft, which is what it will normally face in all game modes.\n\nThe Yak-15's major faults include a low top speed, poor acceleration, little armour protection, inability to re-start the engine below certain speeds,  270-330 kph (170-205 mph), and small ammunition pool which collectively make this aircraft harder to use than even other first generation jet aircraft such as the [[He 162 A-2]], the [[Meteor F Mk 3]], and the [[F-80A-5]]. Although it is driven by a jet engine, it is important to recognize the faults and oddities within this aircraft series as they are not representative of the traditional \"jet fighter\" at all. The Yak-15 is most easily viewed as a late-war [[Yak-3]] powered by a jet engine and with a different armament.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nIn Realistic battles, climbing with this aircraft at the start of a match is not always the best course of action, considering how poor the Yak-15's rate of climb is. Instead of the traditional, slow angled climb the Yak-15 is best used in a \"zoom climb\" where once enough energy has been built up at a low altitude the Yak-15 pilot will pitch up, thus gaining a lot of altitude quickly. This way, if attacked during the first few minutes of the match, the Yak-15 still wields some energy whereas had the Yak-15 been slowly climbing, it would have had to face another aircraft's guns. In order to shake an enemy, especially a prop driven enemy, dive low to the ground to ensure your assailant's speed only decreases. This is called a \"speed trap\" and can either be followed by a \"hammerhead\" attack or a continuation of the escape. This tactic of utilizing the Yak-15's ability to hold on to energy in a straight line is negated when facing other jet aircraft who wield the same ability. This is where the Yak-15's dog fighting abilities come into play. Because it is so similar to the Yak-3, the Yak-15 retains some of its manoeuvrability characteristics, namely its turn time. This facet often proves an indispensable one as other first generation jets will not be able to maintain a tight enough turn circle. This allows the Yak-15 to outperform even the best-turning first-generation jets such as the [[Ho 229 V3|Ho 299]] and the [[Vampire FB 5|Vampire]](s), as long as you have an energy advantage.\n\nAdditionally, vertical manoeuvres should be used in favour of horizontal manoeuvres, especially when not actively engaging with an enemy. For example, if turning to approach an enemy, it is best to use a 180° vertical loop rather than a horizontal 180° turn, as this allows you to convert the potential energy gained from your height increase into horizontal speed as you dive. This is a key skill in flying the Yak-15 as speed losses from horizontal manoeuvres take a long time to recover, and should be employed whenever needing to adjust for a horizontal deviation of 30° or greater. Additionally, pilots should refrain from making high-G manoeuvres outside of combat, and should keep all control inputs smooth.\n\nHowever, the Yak-15 is severely hampered in its damage output due to its reliance on a single set of 23 mm NS-23 cannons, with 120 shells total. It is possible to expend this pool in seconds. The Yak-15 shares this downfall with aircraft like the [[Ki-200|Ki-200]], and the [[Me_163_B|Me-163]]. Firing in small, accurate bursts negates this and is the most efficient way of destroying enemies. The 23 mm shells these cannons fire are extremely deadly when they hit and often rip enemies apart.\n\nTo use the guns most effectively, be close to your target. The reason for this is twofold: First, the limited ammo means you want your shots to count. Being close to your target will give your cannons the highest chance of hitting. The second reason is because of the ballistics of the 23 mm shells - their muzzle velocity is not very high, meaning you have to lead your targets by quite a bit. If you are closer to your target, you won't have to lead them by quite as much, although still more than most other cannons.\n\nWith some practice, it is possible to consistently get about 3 fighter kills with one load of ammunition in Realistic battles. Using the Air Targets belt is the most effective. However, attacking bombers is best left to other planes with more firepower, since the Yak-15 does not have the firepower or ammunition to reliably kill heavy bombers without sustaining heavy damage. Heavy fighters such as the [[F7F-1]] may also take longer to destroy than other fighters.\n\nIn Arcade battles, the Yak-15 is capable of breaking up a \"furball\" due to its impressive turn time. This coupled with its hard-hitting cannons makes any Yak-15 pilot an indispensable asset to any Arcade team.\n\n'''Enemies of note:'''\n\n[[Kikka]] - These are significantly faster than you, and climb better. Since they control the engagement, you cannot do much unless they decide to dogfight with you.\n\n[[A2D-1]] -  These turboprops are some of the most common opponents you will see. You vastly outmanoeuvre them, but they can full surprisingly sharp turns and have extremely powerful armament.\n\n[[F-84G-21-RE]] - Found in several nations, these fighters are extremely fast, well armed, and durable. Similar to the Kikka, it can control engagements with you so unless they make a mistake, they will be untouchable, as well as being able to take a few hits from your cannons.\n\n[[SK60B]] - Being slower than you, you can generally control the engagement. However, they are one of the few planes that can manoeuvre with you, so it will require a fair amount of dogfighting knowledge in order to shoot down, and mistakes will be punished-one hit from the 30 mm ADENs will result in critical damage.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Its development started at the end of World War II, when the Soviet Union captured numerous German components, including Junkers Jumo-004 jet engines. This engine was studied in the USSR, and the Klimov OKB created a domestic counterpart under the designation RD-10. In turn, the Yakovlev OKB used the design to produce a jet fighter based on the latest version of the well-liked Yak-3.\n\nThe designers decided in favor of the pod-and-boom layout. A turbojet engine with 900 kg thrust was mounted instead of the old VK-107A piston engine. The engine was inclined so that the jet stream exited underneath the fuselage and wing. The rest of the airframe was left almost unchanged, except for an additional heat shield, made of refractory steel, located in the exhaust section. The aircraft's armament included two Nudelman-Suranov NS-23KM cannons with 60 rounds each. The cannons were housed in the forward fuselage above the engine. The new Yakovlev fighter was originally called the Yak-Jumo but later obtained the designation Yak-15.\n\nThe first flight of the Yak-15 was on April 24, 1946, and the plane was launched into full-scale production in the autumn of the same year. Production Yak-15 planes had a different engine, the RD-10, manufactured in the USSR. The service life of the earliest engines was officially claimed to be 25 hours, but in reality it was 17 hours at best. Nevertheless, the Yak-15 was very easy to pilot, and its steering was similar to that of the Yak-3, which had been the basis of its development. As a result, it was decided that although the Yak-15 did not meet the requirements of the Air Force for a modern combat fighter, it was perfectly suitable as a transition from prop to jet aircraft.\n\nIn addition to its engine's limited service life, the Yak-15 had a number of distinctive disadvantages. The most commonly encountered defects during its operation included hydraulic fluid leaks (through the sealing rings of the landing gear shock struts), the rupturing of rudder control cable threads, and the deterioration of tail wheel springs (probably caused by overheating). But the Yak-15's main disadvantage was its very short flight range.\n\nNevertheless, the significance of the Yak-15 in the history of Soviet aviation should not be underestimated. Hundreds of pilots underwent training on planes of this type, and it was the Yak-15 that became the first Soviet jet aircraft officially accepted for service in the Air Force as well as the first jet fighter that enabled military pilots to master advanced aerobatics.\n\nProduction of the Yak-15 was discontinued in 1947. In all, 280 planes were constructed.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=yak-15 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nCockpit Yak-15.jpg|<smallCockpit of the Yak-15 explained</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|aPfgmUwiJMA|'''The Shooting Range #10''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:51 discusses the Yak-15.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/320875-yakovlev-yak-15/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yakovlev}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
