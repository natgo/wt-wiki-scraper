Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Yak-23 has an extremely light airframe and relatively powerful jet which gives it an enormous thrust-to-weight ratio, making it one of the best accelerating (and climbing) jets in War Thunder. The Yak-23 is not only a good bomber hunter but also an excellent fighter. Almost no jet can accelerate better than the Yak-23 below 800 km/h and no jet in the Yak-23's BR bracket can compete with its climb rate unless it has a massive energy advantage. This gives the Yak-23 a huge advantage over the vast majority of opponents it meets. The Yak-23 cannot carry any ordnance and is thus purely subjugated to fighter duties and should be used accordingly.\n\n;Combat tactics\n\nAlways take minimum fuel (9 min) as fuel forms a significant part of the Yak-23's mass. An important fuel load will severely dampen the Yak-23's performance. Ammo is limited enough as it is so extra fuel should not be necessary anyway.\n\nThe Yak-23 should fight in the vertical and utilize its excellent manoeuvrability to take careful shots and stay out of the line of fire of enemy guns. Energy-conserving chandelles and stalls are by far the most effective tactics to utilize as they best use the Yak-23's insane acceleration and climb rate while depleting your enemy's energy.\n\nThe [[G.91 (Family)|G.91]] is by far the greatest threat to the Yak-23, as it is a small target, faster, and has high-velocity quick-firing Browning M3 machine guns that will make quick work of the Yak-23. That, combined with its excellent roll rate makes it exceedingly difficult to hit with the low-velocity 23 mm cannons mounted on the Yak-23.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Acceleration below 800 km/h and climb rate unrivalled by anything but rocket-powered aircraft\n* Excellent manoeuvrability\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Plane wobbles badly while manoeuvring beyond 700 km/h\n* 23 mm guns with low muzzle velocity and low fire rate tend to spark\n* Small ammunition pool\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the aircraft in more detail than in the introduction.
