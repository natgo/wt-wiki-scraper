It was introduced in [[Update \"New Power\"]]. Like the Harrier, it is an aircraft with a VTOL capability. The {{PAGENAME}} is externally almost identical to the Yak-38 and the few differences are difficult to identify in combat, aside from the plane's stock livery. These features are the tail boom (long and coloured in red for the 38M while short for the 38) and the forward Pitot tube (striped for the 38M and unicolour for the 38).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Yak-38 is not very fast (you can reach Mach 1 in a slight dive when carrying minimum loadout) and not very nimble (bad energy retention in tight turns) so you'll lose many engagements with dedicated boom and zoom and dogfight optimised aircraft. What really makes this plane shine is the customizable loadout as well as its amazing rate of climb (101.2 m/s when spaded) and acceleration.\n\nDue to your low speed it is wise to avoid high altitude combat as you'll be pitted against supersonic interceptors at this BR. Try to stay low and either ground pound or destroy enemy attackers. Doing this your main opponents are F-86 and Harrier variants. Both of which will out-turn you in a dog fight.\n\nYou have two options for dogfighting aircraft:\n\nUse your climb rate to get into an advantageous position. You can out-climb almost all aircraft of your battle rating. And as long as you stay at lower altitudes you'll most likely be able to avoid those aircraft that can out-climb you.\n\nSwitch to hover mode. The Yak's hover mode can only be engaged at speeds below 450 km/h so you have to plan ahead a bit or react really fast once you slow down enough. Your goal here should be to get into the center of the enemies turning circle. When executed correctly it is impossible for the enemy to get their aim on you, while you are still perfectly able to fire at them. And if they disengage they set themselves up for you to lock on with AAMs. But be aware that engaging hover mode will make you an easy target for other aircraft that are not part of the dogfight so it's best used in 1 on 1 situations.\n\n'''Air to Air'''\n\nThe Yak-38M has several air to air options for its loadout. You can also set one additional 23mm gun-pod as offensive weapon in your modifications menu. Keep in mind that gun pods add a substantial amount of drag and heavily impact your climb and turn rate and are not dropped after expending their ammo.\n\nAll combinations of gun-pods, R-60 and S-24B are viable but emphasize on different ways to approach enemy aircraft.\n\n- Central gun-pod + R-60 keeps your drag quite low and still leaves you with a main gun after firing both missiles.\n\n- Everything from two gun-pods (2x pods or central pod + 2x pods) up creates a high volume of fire and makes the Yak-38M deadly in head-on approaches. This can be combined with R-60 for taking out faster planes.\n\n- 4 pods (5 with central pod) give an incredible burst mass of over 40 kg/s and will shred everything in a head-on approach. In many cases this will be overkill though. The pods can't be fired independently and trigger discipline is required to not run out of ammo too fast. Also there is no R-60 in this config.\n\n- 2x R-60 + 2x S-24B (+ central pod) opens up the possibility to make snapshots on passing enemies with very deadly anti-bunker rockets. With a bit of practise and setting a detonation distance you are comfortable with the S-24B can be used to reliably take out every plane in its large burst radius. Can also be used in head-on approaches but in contrast to adding more gun-pods they won't create any drag after you have fired them.\n\n'''Air to Ground'''\n\nYou have access to a ballistics computer for your rockets and guns. A ballistics computer is not available for bombs.\n\nAs with the Su-7 it gives you firing solutions for your guns on ground and missiles on ground.\n\nThe loadout you should choose depends heavily on whether you are playing Air RB or Ground RB. For Air RB gun-pods and rocket-pods are most useful to take out groups of smaller ground targets like vehicles, light tanks, howitzers, etc.\n\nThe available bomb loadout is not sufficient to be threatening to enemy bases in any way, so it is recommended to not attempt to bomb enemy bases.\n\nFor Ground RB the Kh-23M gives you access to two beam riding ATGMs with an TNT equivalent of almost 100kg. As with all beam riding missiles you will be an easy target while keeping your nose pointed at the enemy. As you will face SPAAs equipped with SAMs at this BR, taking 2x 500 kg bombs might be more useful depending on the situation and composition of the enemy team.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

As a result, engineers at the Yakovlev design bureau began work on the new aircraft in the late 1960's, basing their design on experience gained from developing the preceding Yak-36 - an early VTOL demonstration design.\n\nThe new aircraft, designated Yak-36M, was being developed for immediate frontline service, operating both from land bases as well as aircraft-carrying ships. The aircraft's primary role was that of a strike aircraft, engaging ground and surface targets while also being suited to intercept enemy aircraft and helicopters if necessary.\n\nNot too long after work on the project began, the first prototype saw completion and conducted its maiden flight in December 1970. Subsequent prototypes and trials continued testing the aircraft's performance, particularly its novel VTOL capabilities. By 1973, the aircraft was considered ready and serial production commenced.\n\nAfter some further testing and crew training, the aircraft officially entered service with the Soviet Navy in August 1977, receiving the designation Yak-38. By 1982, over 140 Yak-38's were built, all of which served aboard the then new Kiev-class aircraft carriers. In the mid 1980's, the modernized Yak-38M version came into service, most prominently featuring more powerful engines as well as other improvements. About 50 Yak-38M's were built before the type was ultimately decommissioned in 1991.\n\n=== Further development ===\nThe Yak-38M was seen as a stepping stone to a better VTOL aircraft by the Yakovlev Design Bureau. A large part of the Yak-38M design would end up in the Yak-41M which instead of having 2 nozzles, would instead pivot a much larger single engine exhaust while still retaining the 2 lift engines at the front, and unlike the Yak-38M it was supersonic capable. In the Western world it was known as the Yak-141 while inside the Soviet military it was the Yak-41M. When the Cold War ended and funding for the project was cut Yakovlev looked for other companies that would like to enter a partnership. In 1991 Yakovlev would enter a partnership with Lockheed-Martin and due to this relationship officially change the designation of the 2 flying prototypes to Yak-141. Lockheed-Martin would end up using the experience they gained from this on their X-35 plane which would end up being the F-35 family of planes, the F-35B is the one that has the general engine layout of the Yak-141.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=aircraft&vehicleClass=assault&vehicle=yak-38m Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Yak-38M Devblog Images\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Yak-38M WTWallpaper 001.jpg|\nFile:Yak-38M WTWallpaper 002.jpg|\nFile:Yak-38M WTWallpaper 003.jpg|\nFile:Yak-38M WTWallpaper 004.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|1yFd8lx7vQI|'''Yakovlev Yak-38 Soviet Naval Aviation''' - ''yolkhere''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Yak-38]]\n\n;Aircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[Harrier (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6942-development-yak-38-yak-38m-hover-jet-en|[Development] Yak-38 & Yak-38M: Hover Jet]]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/504154-yak-38m/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n* [[wikipedia:Yakovlev_Yak-38|[Wikipedia] Yakovlev Yak-38]]\n* [http://www.airvectors.net/avredvt.html <nowiki>[Air Vectors]</nowiki> Soviet Jet VTOL: Yak-36, Yak-38, & Yak-41]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yakovlev}}\n{{USSR jet aircraft}}"}}
