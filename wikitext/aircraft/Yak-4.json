In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Yak-4 has relatively unsurprising flight characteristics given its size and rank. It has a lacklustre climb rate and acceleration, and as with most Soviet-engined aircraft, it suffocates above 4,000 m in altitude. Thus, the aircraft should stay at lower altitudes, as the engines will drastically lose thrust above the 4,000 m threshold. As well, the engines will overheat rapidly when applying WEP, so it is advised to keep the engine throttles at 100%.\n\nThe Yak-4 isn't that manoeuvrable, though it can outfly larger twin-engine bombers such as the [[Wellington (Family)|Wellington]] or [[He 111 (Family)|He 111]]. Its control surfaces are rather stiff, and thus the aircraft doesn't roll or turn particularly quickly. Top speed is also rather mediocre, reaching ~450 km/h when flying at lower altitudes. Though the aircraft has decent dive performance, keep in mind that the aircraft's wings will break off at 680 km/h.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,800 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Yak-4 can be used primarily as a ground attack aircraft, as its small bomb load prevents it from being an effective bomber. Pilots can utilize the aircraft's airspawn and 100 kg bomb load to destroy softer targets, then return to base to rearm. The aircraft is fitted with a single frontal 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun and a similar weapon at the rear of the cockpit; though effective, these machine guns are no match for the armament typically carried on fighters the Yak-4 will face in battle. Thus, avoid getting into any dogfights, and if being chased, use the dorsal turret to light up any pursuing aircraft.\n\nAt the start of the battle, locate and fly towards any targets located at the sides of the map, as you are less likely to be intercepted and attacked by any approaching fighters. The 100 kg bombs can be used to destroy any harder targets (like light pillboxes or light tanks), while the ShKAS can be used against softer targets such as anti-aircraft guns and vehicles. Keep in mind that the Yak-4 has access to a bomb sight - this can make precision bombing a much easier task. However, it may be more effective to use the 100 kg bombs against \"light\" targets, as medium tanks and pillboxes will require direct hits to destroy.\n\nIf you see an enemy fighter approaching, the best strategy is to simply run towards your own side and request fighter cover. This is because the Yak-4 is completely uncompetitive against the fighters it usually faces, including [[Spitfire (Family)|Spitfires]], [[Hurricane (Family)|Hurricanes]], and [[Bf 109 (Family)|Bf 109s]]. You're less agile than them, and also have a slower speed. If there is no option at all, simply fly away from the pursuing fighter - force them to come in from behind, where your ShKAS is able to fire at them. Though the ShKAS is only of 7.62 mm calibre, it can still do significant damage and potentially set an engine on fire, if used right. Though it may be tempting to head-on, don't do it - you have no frontal armour and a significantly weaker frontal armament, which is the perfect recipe for a quick pilot-snipe.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nThe Yakovlev Yak-4 was a light bomber developed from the Yak-2 light bomber (not to be confused with the Yak-2 KABB attacker), the result of a series of improvements implemented to rectify the issues of its predecessor, which included inadequate speed, an unsatisfactory cooling system, and a weak/troublesome undercarriage. To increase speed, the drag of engine doors and cowlings was reduced, the fuselage upper decking was cut down, and the aircraft was refitted with Klimov M-105 engines. Such improvements increased the speed by 10-20 km/h. To reduce overheating, the oil coolers were relocated to the chin of the engine compartments. To fix problems with the undercarriage, the single wheeled landing gear was replaced with a double wheeled one. The Yak-4 first flew on February 20, 1940, was put into service in 1941, and had its production terminated that same year. A majority of the aircraft were sent to the 316th Reconnaissance Regiment in the Kiev Military District. Although officially retired in 1945, it is not believed that their usage extended much past Operation Barbarossa as the German forces destroyed most of them in its opening days, in large part due to the inexperience of soviet aircrews. However, a few remaining Yak-4s may have found use later in the war as glider tugs or suppliers. A total of around 90 were produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=yak-4 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|G3SpLyslNTs|'''Realistic: Yak-4 [Lean Mean Bombing Machine]''' - ''Jengar''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/392575-yak-4/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yakovlev}}\n{{USSR bombers}}"}}
