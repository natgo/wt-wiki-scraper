In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet fighter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.33]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\n\nThe configuration of the Yak-9K's engine is for excellent low altitude performance and manoeuvrability, though, without necessary turbo or superchargers, the aircraft's performance at high altitude suffers.  The Immelmann speed of the {{PAGENAME}} is superior to the majority of comparable fighters at the same battle rating making it a capable dogfighter.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nA {{PAGENAME}} offers good pilot protection, it is unlikely that a pilot snipe should occur.  Due to strengthened structure and centralising of the critical components, it is a real possibility for a skilled pilot to clip an enemies plane with a wingtip and remain unscathed, either slicing the enemy's wing or disabling a propeller. Though the {{PAGENAME}} does have self sealing fuel tanks located in the wing, that does not preclude them from catching on fire.\n\n* 64 mm Bulletproof glass in cockpit front\n* 64 mm Bulletproof glass pilot's headrest\n* 8 mm Steel plate in the pilot's seat\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Offensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Offensive}}\n<!-- ''Describe the offensive armament of the aircraft, if any.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n====Engaging fighters & bombers ====\nMost enemy fighters will be between 3,000 and 3,800 m, with bombers being around 4,000 to 5,000 m. It's important to use your height advantage, drop down from your height and and get behind the enemy. Once behind the fighter or bomber, do not engage until you are close enough to see their tails in your crosshair. Aim forward and fire only a single shot or a short burst which is no longer than two seconds. If you miss and they turn, pending how sharp the turn is follow them. If it's a very sharp turn do not turn with them, instead open the throttle and climb back up to gain a height advantage. Then either try it again or find a new bandit to knock out.\n\n====Ground & Naval Battles====\nIn ground and naval battles, the Yak-9K is able to destroy armoured targets with ease. It does not have any secondary armaments such as bombs or rockets. However, its 45 mm cannon is able to destroy heavy tanks. To do this, aim for the roof and dive straight down upon them like an angel that is fighting a demon. In ship combat, the 45 mm cannon is able to penetrate the decks of many heavily armoured ships, but you must aim for roof or sides of the ships. When handling smaller ships such as Patrol boats, do not fly in a straight line. Instead, zip up and down, left to right, then suddenly turn and shoot them. A single well placed shot will destroy their ammo racks and set the ship to visit Davy Jones' locker!\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Yak-9 was a Soviet single-engine fighter of the WWII era. It was the first combat aircraft designed by Alexander Yakovlev's construction bureau. The most mass-produced Soviet fighter of the war, it remained in production from October 1942 to December 1948, with a total of 16,769 built.\n\nThe Yak-9 was a further modification of the Yak-1 and Yak-7. In its core design, it was a redesign of the Yak-7. With few external differences, Yak-9 was at the same time much more advanced internally. This is not unexpected, as almost two years of design and combat experience of the Yak series went into the Yak-9. Also, at the time aluminium was in much greater supply than it had been two years previously at the start of the war. Amongst other things, the use of metal allowed the plane's weight to be significantly reduced, meaning that more fuel could be stored and that the aircraft could be equipped with more powerful armament and more specialized equipment.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=yak-9k Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|aQDGo7bXdeg|'''Russian Intercontinental Fridge Launcher: Yak-9K''' - ''Slick Plays''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/109520-yakovlev-yak-9k/ Official data sheet - more details about the performance]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yakovlev}}\n{{USSR fighters}}"}}
