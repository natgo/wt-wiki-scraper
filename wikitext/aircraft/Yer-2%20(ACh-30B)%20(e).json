In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe Yer-2 (ACh-30B) is a long-range twin-engine bomber capable of carrying a very heavy payload of bombs (up to 5,000 kg) over shorter distances. Unlike the [[Yer-2 (Family)|earlier models]], the Yer-2 (ACh-30B) equipped with Charomskiy ACh-30B diesel engines for improved fuel economy and range at the cost of some performance due to the heavier engines. \n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Yer-2's ACh-30B diesel engines were optimised for fuel economy and not pure performance. Thus, the ACh-30B-engined model is actually slower than the earlier M-105-engined models, especially because the diesel engines are significantly heavier than the earlier gasoline engines. The other aspects of its flight performance are unremarkable compared to other contemporary heavy bombers. It should also be kept in mind that the already poor flight performance is significantly degraded when carrying the maximum 5,000 kg payload.\n\nThe Yer-2 is also by no means an agile aircraft in the first place and the airframe will not tolerate much G-load, hence it is very ill advised to make sudden control inputs with the aircraft unless playing in Arcade mode.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

The rest of the modules are up to the player, but the survivability modules are recommended to withstand the beating you will be getting by fighters and interceptors.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Yer-2 with diesel ACh-30B engines is the last traditional heavy bomber in the Soviet tree until the [[Tu-4]], and it retains its previous models' strengths and weaknesses. The main draw of the diesel Yer-2s is the gigantic payload at its disposal (up to 5,000 kg), being the second best at the BR behind the British [[Lancaster B Mk I|Lancaster]]. However, the heavier diesel engines mean that it is actually slower than the earlier M-105-engined variants. \n\nThe airframe itself is not very durable, and with only two engines, the aircraft cannot maintain flight if one is knocked out. As such, it is best to avoid any form of engagement at all costs. The late model diesel Yer-2 has a side-by-side pilot cockpit arrangement, but is otherwise near identical to the early diesel Yer-2.\n\nCarrying the maximum payload will also significantly degrade the already underwhelming flight performance of the Yer-2. Because of this, some careful planning is required in order to be able to carry the payload to its target:\n\n* high altitude bomber: the Yer-2 can attempt to climb to high altitudes in order to avoid attracting attention, but this is hampered by the poor performance the Yer-2 offers above 4,000 m due to its engine not receiving enough oxygen. While the safest playstyle, it is definitely the slowest and most boring one. It is recommended to side climb at the start of a match to avoid confrontation and gain altitude quickly. Ideally, one should climb to around 6,000–6,500 m to avoid being noticed by fighters below (and getting a marker in Arcade and Realistic Battles), and so that the planes that do notice it will have trouble climbing there quickly. At this altitude, airfield AA defences are also not a threat.\n\n* medium altitude bomber: alternatively, one can maintain around 3,000–4,000 m altitude and flank around the map towards bases. It is recommended to use this playstyle when the aircraft is fully upgraded, as there is a higher chance of being attacked by enemy fighters who see the Yer-2 as easy prey. It is highly recommended to avoid flying through the middle of the battlefield at all costs, as this is where most fighters tend to concentrate their attention on.\n\nIt is also important to note that the Yer-2 cannot spawn on airfields in Simulator Battles, as the take-off run is too long. It will thus be freshly spawned in the air at the very rear edge of the team's side of the map. However, if a successful landing is made on one of the airfields, the Yer-2 can be respawned in the air over that airfield instead.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

Tests showed that planes with these engines outperformed the original Yer-2s (with M-105 engines) in speed, rate of climb, and service ceiling, but they were not launched into full-scale production due to the engines being too \"raw\" for service.\n\nSo the designers fitted the aircraft with Charomsky M-30B (Ach-30B, from 1944 on) diesel engines with tractor kerosene. The production of Yer-2s with M-30B engines began in late 1943 at Irkutsk Aircraft Factory No. 39.\n\nThe aircraft was equipped with two 1,500 hp ACh-30B diesel engines with AV-5LV-116 variable-pitch propellers featuring an larger diameter than that of the VISh-22Ye.\n\nExternally, the diesel Yer-2s differed from their predecessors in several ways: more extended fuselage contours, rudder horn balance, and changes in the design of the engine ducted-radiator shutters. The capacity of the internal fuel tanks, equipped with an inert gas pressurization system, was increased.\n\nThe aircraft's defensive armament was reinforced. The forward ball mount, with a ShKAS machine gun, was replaced with a new NU-134 forward mount with a 12.7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun featuring 195-rounds of ammunition. The LU-MV-2 hatch mount with a 7.62-mm ShKAS was replaced with an LU-MV-2B turret that had a 12.7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun with a pneumatic reloading system and 275 rounds. Instead of the TAT-BT upper mount, a TUM-5 cannon turret was installed, which had a 20 mm ShVAK cannon with 200 rounds.\n\nThe bomb bay was lengthened, and the aircraft's maximum bomb capacity was increased up to 5,000 kg. The plane was able to carry 3,000 kg (3 FAB-1000 bombs) suspended externally and 2,000 kg more inside the bomb bay. The OPB-2M bomb sight was replaced with a PS-1 synchronized sight with a special fairing. The Yer-2 became the most powerful twin-engine bomber the Soviets had.\n\nThese modifications significantly increased the bomber's takeoff weight, which required new landing gear wheels with an enlarged diameter.\n\nOnly 2 Yer-2 aircraft were produced at Irkutsk Aircraft Factory No. 39 during the whole year of 1943. 47 more Yer-2s with a single-seat pilot's cockpit were built, until August 1944 when bombers with a two-seat pilot's cockpit started to be produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=er-2_ach30b_early Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yermolaev}}\n{{USSR bombers}}"}}
