In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27.\n\nThe Yer-2 (ACh-30B) is a long-range twin-engine bomber capable of carrying a very heavy payload of bombs (up to 5,000 kg) over shorter distances. It is the final, definitive production model of the Yer-2, equipped with Charomskiy ACh-30B diesel engines for improved fuel economy and range. It can be distinguished from the [[Yer-2 (ACh-30B) (e)|early model]] by the widened cockpit.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Yer-2's ACh-30B diesel engines were optimised for fuel economy and not pure performance. Thus, the ACh-30B-engined model is actually slower than the earlier M-105-engined models, especially because the diesel engines are significantly heavier than the earlier gasoline engines. The other aspects of its flight performance are unremarkable compared to other contemporary heavy bombers. It should also be kept in mind that the already poor flight performance is significantly degraded when carrying the maximum 5,000 kg payload.\n\nThe Yer-2 is also by no means an agile aircraft in the first place and the airframe will not tolerate much G-load, hence it is very ill-advised to make sudden control inputs with the aircraft unless playing in Arcade mode. In fact, the later diesel Yer-2 model has even lower structural G-tolerance than the [[Yer-2 (ACh-30B) (e)|early]] diesel-engined model.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 6,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

The rest of the modules are up to the player, but the survivability modules are recommended to withstand the beating you will be getting by fighters and interceptors.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Yer-2 with diesel ACh-30B engines is the last traditional heavy bomber in the Soviet line-up until the [[Tu-4]], and it retains its previous models' strengths and weaknesses. The main draw of the diesel Yer-2s is the gigantic payload at its disposal (up to 5,000 kg), being the second best at the BR behind the British [[Lancaster B Mk I|Lancaster]]. However, the heavier diesel engines mean that it is actually slower than the earlier M-105-engined variants.\n\nThe airframe itself is not very durable, and with only two engines, the aircraft cannot maintain flight if one engine is knocked out. As such, it is best to avoid any form of engagement at all costs. The late model diesel Yer-2 has a side-by-side pilot cockpit arrangement, but is otherwise near identical to the early diesel Yer-2.\n\nCarrying the maximum payload will also significantly degrade the already underwhelming flight performance of the Yer-2. Because of this, some careful planning is required in order to be able to carry the payload to its target:\n\n* high altitude bomber: the Yer-2 can attempt to climb to high altitudes in order to avoid attracting attention, but this is hampered by the poor performance the Yer-2 offers above 4,000 m due to its engine not receiving enough oxygen. While the safest playstyle, it is definitely the slowest and most boring one. It is recommended to side climb at the start of a match to avoid confrontation and gain altitude quickly. Ideally, one should climb to around 6,000–6,500 m to avoid being noticed by fighters below (and getting a marker in Arcade and Realistic Battles), and so that the planes that do notice it will have trouble climbing there quickly. At this altitude, airfield AA defences are also not a threat.\n\n* medium altitude bomber: alternatively, one can maintain around 3,000–4,000 m altitude and flank around the map towards bases. It is recommended to use this playstyle when the aircraft is fully upgraded, as there is a higher chance of being attacked by enemy fighters who see the Yer-2 as easy prey. It is highly recommended to avoid flying through the middle of the battlefield at all costs, as this is where most fighters tend to concentrate their attention on.\n\nIt is also important to note that the Yer-2 cannot spawn on airfields in Simulator Battles, as the take-off run is too long. It will thus be freshly spawned in the air at the very rear edge of the team's side of the map. However, if a successful landing is made on one of the airfields, the Yer-2 can be respawned in the air over that airfield instead.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe command staff of the Long-Range Air Force (LRAF) proposed adding a second pilot to the Yer-2's crew, placing him next to the commander. This decision significantly reduced the workload imposed on pilots during long flights.\n\nThe pilot's cockpit now had two seats, and its appearance was completely changed. The pilots' chairs were located side by side (the commander's to the left and the co-pilot's to the right) under the improved canopy, which was now the classical type instead of the earlier asymmetrical version.\n\nThe navigator's station was shifted to the forward section of the fuselage. The elliptical outlines of the forward section common to the Yer-2 were now straightened, and the upper section of the navigator's cockpit was lowered. These improvements only barely influenced the plane's flight characteristics, but they noticeably improved visibility from the pilot's cockpit. The navigator's work with his sextant became easier, thanks to the transparent astrodome.\n\nAn OPB-2R sight was mounted instead of the PS-1 sight, resulting in the removal of its external fairing.\n\nYer-2 bombers with the new two-seat cockpit and the new navigator's cockpit were produced at Factory No. 39 beginning in August 1944. 101 aircraft were built. Production continued into 1945, with the number of planes reaching 241.\n\nYer-2 bombers built at the factory in Irkutsk entered service beginning in February 1944. Although these aircraft reached the front line when the war with Germany was almost over, they were used actively enough on the Northwestern and Baltic Fronts. Yer-2s made a significant contribution to the successful assault of the fortress city of Königsberg with their large-sized bombs.\n\nBased on their combat experience, the various crews formed a generally favourable attitude towards the Yer-2, built with ACh-30B diesel engines. The pilots liked its comfortable cockpit with excellent visibility, powerful defensive armament, large bomb capacity, and strong airframe structure. The aircraft's high survivability was also noted. Yer-2s with diesel engines practically never caught fire, since kerosene was much more difficult to ignite than petrol.\n\nYer-2 bombers were withdrawn from service in 1946.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=er-2_ach30b_late Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yermolaev}}\n{{USSR bombers}}"}}
