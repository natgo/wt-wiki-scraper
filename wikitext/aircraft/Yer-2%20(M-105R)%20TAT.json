Externally, M-105R engines differed from M-105s by having individual exhaust pipes instead of twin exhaust manifolds on the side cowlings.\n\nThe standard configuration of Yer-2s of later production series included a TAT-VT upper turret with a 12.7 mm Berezin BT machine gun. Instead of the LU-MV-2 hatch mount with a 7.62 mm ShKAS, the aircraft was given an LU-MV-2B mount with a 12.7 mm BT machine gun featuring a manual reloading system and fed from detachable magazines. The total magazine capacity was 240 rounds.\n\nThe Yer-2 bomber outperformed the DB-3F's maximum and cruise speed, as well as its flight range (with a normal combat load). In comparison to the DB-3F, the Yer-2 was easier to pilot. But the relatively low critical altitude of the M-105 engines meant that combat missions with the Yer-2 were very risky, since the chance of being hit by anti-aircraft gun fire or intercepted by enemy fighters was higher, and the plane was also more affected by weather conditions on its route.\n\nIn addition, the Yer-2 had unsatisfactory longitudinal and lateral stability, due to the large loads imposed on the aircraft's flight controls. The insufficient power of M-105 engines dramatically increased the runway length required for takeoff.\n\nWhen World War II started, no Yer-2s yet served with the Soviet troops. The first bomber air regiment to use this aircraft was formed in August of 1941.\n\nYer-2 bombers flew their first sortie on August 10, 1941, when they participated in a raid over Berlin. Regiments armed with Yer-2s acted as day and night bombers on the Western Front. They bombed Polotsk, Minsk, Orsha, Vitebsk, Novgorod, and Smolensk. In November 1941, Yer-2s attacked Königsberg. Yer-2 bombers with M-105 engines fought until May 1942, but some machines were flown until late 1943.\n\nThe production of Yer-2s with M-105 engines was discontinued in September 1941. A total of 71 aircraft had been built.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the aircraft;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Yermolaev}}\n{{USSR bombers}}\n[[Category:Hidden vehicles]]"}}
