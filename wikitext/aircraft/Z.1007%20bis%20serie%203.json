In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' ''\"Alcione\" (Kingfisher)'' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]] alongside the initial Italian aviation tree.\n\nKnown as ''the'' premier bomber in Italian service, the wooden \"Alcione\" offers superior speed performance to its tech tree predecessor the [[S.M.79_(Family)|S.M.79]] and better ordnance variety. As a fast medium bomber it can do repeated attack runs per match, with average payload weight, but less than mediocre defensive armament.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nModerate manoeuvrability at slow speeds with a bad roll rate, the Z.1007 is a generic medium bomber with predictable performance and decent speed to its name. The elevator starts to slowly lock up above 200 km/h and continues to do so in a linear fashion, however it neatly prevents overstressing and breaking the wings with G-forces. Compared to the S.M.79 it lacks combat flaps and leading slats, increasing the stall speed. Further, the Z.1007 also features worse lock up and comparable manoeuvrability. Fortunately the acceleration and top speed are far better, though the Alcione still won't outrun any fighter or heavy fighter.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"70%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(meters)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(meters/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(meters)\n|-\n!

Instead a focus should be on the engine upgrades to boost speed and thusly survivability as well as mission success rate.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|GP 50 (50 kg)|GP 100 (100 kg)|GP 250 (250 kg)|GP 500 (500 kg)|GP 800 (800 kg)}}\n{{main|F200/450}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n\n* 18 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (900 kg total)\n* 18 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,800 kg total)\n* 1 x F200/450 torpedo\n* 4 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs + 12 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (2,200 kg total)\n* 6 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs + 3 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (1,650 kg total)\n* 6 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs + 3 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,800 kg total)\n* 2 x 500 kg GP 500 bombs + 6 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,600 kg total)\n* 2 x 500 kg GP 500 bombs + 4 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs (2,000 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg GP 800 bomb + 3 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (950 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg GP 800 bomb + 3 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,100 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg GP 800 bomb + 9 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,700 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg GP 800 bomb + 4 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs + 3 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (2,100 kg total)\n\nMany payload option utilise the wing mounts and consequently reduce the crucial top speed. However only using the internal bomb bay limits the ordnance to a mere 1,100 kg total. Depending on load-out option the external bombs may even drop last e.g. the heaviest last one. On average a single Z.1007 can take out 1.5 bases in an uptier and close to 2 in a downtier.\nNoteworthy is the internally mounted torpedo. The F200/450 is, with a drop speed of 300 km/h @ max 100 m altitude (273 ft/s @ 328 feet), quite mediocre, but features a very high in-water speed of 80 km/h (73 ft/s).\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Scotti M1933 (12.7 mm)|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Scotti M1933 machine gun, dorsal turret (350 rpg)\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine gun, ventral turret (350 rpg)\n* 2 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, side turrets (500 rpg)\n\nWorse than average the defensive turrets can only boast decent firing arcs, ventral and dorsal turret feature overlapping rear fields of fire. However a frontal gun is missing entirely and is only covered by turning the dorsal turret by 180° which takes time. Armament-wise there is no upgrade from the S.M.79.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nLacking in both defensive armament and protection, not to mention blessed with early control lock-up speeds, the Z.1007 is pushed into the role of a hit-and-run bomber. Either against ground bases with mediocre success or as ground support against stationary ground units and armoured columns. The latter option is quite viable with multiple drops available per run depending on the load-out, learning the drop order of the payload allows to maximize the effect of each bomb by selecting the appropriate target in ground strike missions.\n\nFor [[:Category:Game_modes#Realistic_Battles|tank battles]] the control lock-up disables any dive bombing attempts with a landing you cannot walk away from, even though the wing pylons make it technically possible. Necessitating a straight, direct and deliberate fly-over the target zone with the narrow field of view bomb sight. As this makes the attack run easy to track and even easier to intercept. Thusly it is not recommended for any mixed game mode with the exception of naval battles. With an internally bomb bay mounted torpedo the Alcione does not suffer a speed penalty like many other medium torpedo bombers. Mind though: The travel distance is only 3 km in water and it isn't a small aircraft. A suicide run is the most likely outcome of any engagement, unless one manages to align the attack run with several islands for cover.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was used on all Italian fronts despite being of all-wood construction. Also known as the Alcione, it was designed by Filippo Zappata, with the prototype debuting in spring, 1937. After 34 original models, production shifted to the bis model, with a more powerful radial engine; over 400 of this model would ultimately be built. They conducted combat tests with Italian forces in Belgium during the Battle of Britain in September, 1940, used for diversionary actions only. Their real combat debut was a month later, during the Greek campaign. They also flew in Africa and the Mediterranean. They were not used much in Russia. A total of 560 were built, with about 60 still in service when Italy surrendered. About 30 continued on after, now in Allied service, in the Balkans. Unlike the later serie 5 with the twin tails (Italian: ''bideriva'') the serie 3 still features a single rudder (''monoderiva'').\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n{{Youtube-gallery|67tQxwYb8lc|'''\"Update 1.69 - Z.1007 bis serie 3/5\"''' by ''TheEuropeanCanadian''|xR8a59w2x5I|'''\"War Thunder Realistic: Z.1007 bis serie 3 (Regia Aeronautica)\"''' by ''Jengar''}}\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/post/613870/en/ Skin: 210th Squadrilia, 50th Grupo, 16th Stormo during the invasion of Greece in 1941 - by ''MajorDSaster'']\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/post/636230/en/ Skin: C.R.D.A.
