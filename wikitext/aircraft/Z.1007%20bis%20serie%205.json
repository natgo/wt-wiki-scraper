In the second part, tell the reader about the aircraft in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian bomber {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]].\n\nThe Z.1007 bis serie 5 is a relatively versatile medium bomber, sacrificing defensive armament and instead focusing on speed in order to avoid interception. It has a relatively decent bomb-load with several options for use against different kinds of targets from AA, pillboxes, tanks to ships.\n\nThe Z.1007 bis is a distinct upgrade over the [[S.M.79 (Family)|SM.79 series]] in every aspect. It can carry an extra 6 x 100 kg bombs on external racks in addition to the internal 2 x 500 kg bombs, which is 600 kg more than any of the SM.79 series can carry. This load-out is the best one against bases. It can also carry an extra 250 kg bomb over the SM.79 series for a total of 6 x 250 kg bombs. This payload is better for destroying tanks, but requires precise aim to destroy pillboxes; the 500 kg bombs may be more forgiving if attacking them from altitude. It can also carry a single torpedo for use against shipping.\n\nIn order to make up for the weak power output of Italian engines, the Z.1007 bis has the tri-motor configuration characteristic of Italian bombers. The combined horsepower of the three engines provides decent flight performance, but losing even a single engine will immensely degrade it. The Z.1007 bis is also faster than the SM.79 series, which is fortunate because it has a relatively poor defensive armament despite its good coverage. The dorsal turret can cover 360 degrees, but is armed with only one of the relatively weak Italian 12.7 mm machine guns. The beam 7.7 mm guns are effectively worthless, and should not be depended upon. The ventral 12.7 mm machine gun provides limited coverage to attacks from below.\n\nCompared to its earlier predecessor the [[Z.1007 bis serie 3|serie 3]] it features a twin tail (Italian: ''bideriva'') and a miniscule better top speed.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the aircraft behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nWith alright manoeuvrability at slow speeds and a bad roll rate, the Z.1007 is a generic medium bomber with expectable performance and decent speed to its name. The elevator starts to slowly lock up above 200 km/h and continues to do so in a linear fashion, however it neatly prevents overstressing and breaking the wings with G-forces. Compared to the S.M.79 it lacks combat flaps and leading slats, increasing the stall speed. Further the Z.1007 also features worse lock up and comparable manoeuvrability. Fortunately the acceleration and top speed are far better, yet the Alcione will not outrun any fighter or heavy fighter, too.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 4,500 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Turn time<br>(seconds)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Rate of climb<br>(metres/second)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Take-off run<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical aircraft systems.'' -->\nBeing an all wooden design and designed as a fast bomber, the Z.1007 lacks any sort of protection and solely relies on its speed to survive on the battlefield. Despite the lack of armour it takes a few shots to pilot snipe from the rear as in the narrow fuselage the gunners act literal meat shields, quite macabre.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n# Get ''Radiator'' for the speed boost and also the boost to cooling, then the ''TBC-79''.\n# Next, get the ''MCGP250'' and ''Compressor'' upgrades to unlock the 250 kg bombs and a slight performance boost, respectively.\n# Unlock the ''MCRO500'' upgrade to use the 2 x 500 kg + 6 x 100 kg bomb loadout. This is the loadout that does the most damage to bases, and the 500 kg bomb is easier to use against pillboxes.\n# Focus on performance upgrades over defensive armament.\n# The ''MCGP800'' upgrade with 800 kg bombs is actually worse than the ''MCRO500'' against bases, and can be left as the last upgrade.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Avia-Armaments}}\n=== Suspended armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Suspended}}\n<!-- ''Describe the aircraft's suspended armament: additional cannons under the wings, bombs, rockets and torpedoes. This section is especially important for bombers and attackers. If there is no suspended weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|GP 50 (50 kg)|GP 100 (100 kg)|GP 250 (250 kg)|GP 500 (500 kg)|GP 800 (800 kg)}}\n{{main|F200/450 (450 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' can be outfitted with the following ordnance:\n* 18 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (900 kg total)\n* 18 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,800 kg total)\n* 1 x 450 mm F200/450 torpedo\n* 4 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs + 12 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (2,200 kg total)\n* 6 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs + 3 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (1,650 kg total)\n* 6 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs + 3 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,800 kg total)\n* 2 x 500 kg GP 500 bombs + 6 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,600 kg total)\n* 2 x 500 kg GP 500 bombs + 4 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs (2,000 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg GP 800 bomb + 3 x 50 kg GP 50 bombs (950 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg GP 800 bomb + 3 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,100 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg GP 800 bomb + 9 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (1,700 kg total)\n* 1 x 800 kg GP 800 bomb + 4 x 250 kg GP 250 bombs + 3 x 100 kg GP 100 bombs (2,100 kg total)\n\nMany of the payload options utilise the wing mounts and consequently reduce the crucial top speed. However only using the internal bomb bay limits the ordnance to a mere 1,100 kg total. Depending on load-out option the external bombs may even drop last e.g. the heaviest last one. On average a single Z.1007 can take out 1.5 bases in an uptier and close to 2 in a downtier.\n\nNoteworthy is the internally mounted torpedo. The F200/450 has a max drop speed of 300 km/h at 100 m altitude (273 ft/s @ 328 feet) which is quite mediocre, but features a very high in-water speed of 80 km/h (73 ft/s).\n\n=== Defensive armament ===\n{{Specs-Avia-Defensive}}\n<!-- ''Defensive armament with turret machine guns or cannons, crewed by gunners. Examine the number of gunners and what belts or drums are better to use. If defensive weaponry is not available, remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm)|Scotti (12.7 mm)|Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm)}}\n\nThe '''''{{PAGENAME}}''''' is defended by:\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine gun, ventral turret (350 rpg)\n* 1 x 12.7 mm Scotti machine gun, dorsal turret (350 rpg)\n* 1 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine gun, 2 x beam turrets (500 rpg)\n\nWorse than average, the defensive turrets can only boast decent firing arcs, ventral and dorsal turret feature overlapping rear fields of fire. However a frontal gun is missing entirely and is only covered by turning the dorsal turret by 180° which takes time.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the aircraft, the features of using aircraft in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nLacking in both defensive armament and protection, not to mention blessed with early control lock-up speeds the Z.1007 is pushed into the role of a hit-and-run bomber. Either against ground bases with mediocre success or as ground support against stationary ground units and armoured columns. The latter option is quite viable with multiple drops available per run depending on the load-out, learning the drop order of the payload allows to maximize the effect of each bomb by selecting the appropriate target in ground strike missions.\n\nFor [[:Category:Game_modes#Realistic_Battles|tank battles]] the control lock-up disables any dive bombing attempts with a landing you cannot walk away from, even though the wing pylons make it technically possible. Necessitating a straight, direct and deliberate fly-over the target zone with the narrow field of view bomb sight. As this makes the attack run easy to track and even easier to intercept. Thusly it is not recommended for any mixed game mode with the exception of naval battles. With an internally bomb bay mounted torpedo the Alcione does not suffer a speed penalty like many other medium torpedo bombers. Mind though: The travel distance is only 3 km in water and it isn't a small aircraft. A suicide run is the most likely outcome of any engagement, unless one manages to align the attack run with several islands for cover.\n\nThe biggest difference between the serie 5 from the serie 3 is the twin tail configuration on the serie 5, which eliminates the dorsal turret's dead-zone created by the earlier's single tail. Other than that, they are virtually identical.\n\n=== Manual Engine Control ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | MEC elements\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Mixer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pitch\n! colspan=\"3\" | Radiator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Supercharger\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Turbocharger\n|-\n!

It was used on all Italian fronts despite being of all-wood construction. Also known as the Alcione, it was designed by Filippo Zappata and built by ''Cantieri Aeronautici e Navali Triestini'' (Trieste Shipbuilding and Naval Aeronautics), with the prototype debuting in spring, 1937. After 34 original models, production shifted to the bis model, with a more powerful radial engine; over 400 of this model would ultimately be built. They conducted combat tests with Italian forces in Belgium during the Battle of Britain in September, 1940, used for diversionary actions only. Their real combat debut was a month later, during the Greek campaign. They also flew in Africa and the Mediterranean. They were not used much in Russia. A total of 560 were built, with about 60 still in service when Italy surrendered. About 30 continued on after, now in Allied service, in the Balkans.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n{{Youtube-gallery|67tQxwYb8lc|'''\"Update 1.69 - Z. 1007 bis serie 3/5\"''' by ''TheEuropeanCanadian''}}\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/post/613165/en/ Skin: 9° Stormo, 59^ Squadriglia, 29° Gruppo.
