In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Direct Hit\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->\nThe 2S25 design consists fully of special alloy with lesser armour effectiveness than RHA (rolled homogeneous armour). This means that .50 cal rounds can pass through the 40 mm plate up to 500 m away and 20 mm autocannons rounds 8MBT-70, KPZ-70 and Leopard 2k) can pass through the 40 mm plate up to 1,000 m away. Other parts of the frontal armour are sufficiently angled to deflect .50 cal rounds and 20 mm shells at any range. Due to the weak armour, the rear and the sides and should always be hidden from the enemy as .50 cal rounds and 20 mm shells can go through at any range. Any other IFV armed with an autocannon will be able to destroy the 2S25 from any angle.\n\nThe 2S25 has a total of 3 crew members which makes the survivability of the vehicle is very low as any penetrating rounds will very likely destroy it in one shot.\n\nThe thin armour of the 2S25 makes it highly susceptible to large-calibre HE shells that will be able to overpressure the 2S25 even if it lands next to it.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Alloy ABT-102 (Front, Side, Roof)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It has access to the 3BM42 'Mango' dart, the same dart seen in the early T-72s and T-64s. While it lacks penetration compared to other rounds at the battle-rating (such as M900), it has very decent performance against anything it faces. It lacks punch when it comes to fighting in up-tiers as the dart might not be able to penetrate the frontal plates or mantlet of the MBTs. However, any well placed side shot should be more than enough to dispatch a target with no more than a single shot.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[2A75 (125 mm)|125 mm 2A75]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!
