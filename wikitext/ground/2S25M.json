In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Russian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Ground Breaking\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->The 2S25M, also known as the Sprut-D, is a very capable vehicle which uses speed and agility over armor. The light armor of the Sprut tends to be a 'high risk-high reward' armor as it is only able to stop small firearms but generate little to no fragmentation from the penetration of a solid shot. However, chemical energy weapons such as HEAT and ATGMs will generate more than enough spall to defeat the crew. Armor is not to be relied on whatsoever, even against artillery fragmentation. Due to the oblique angles the frontal plates have, it is able to ricochet enemy projectiles but this is highly unlikely. One of the biggest drawbacks of the Sprut-D are the side-mounted ammo racks. In case of a successful penetration, these will be the first to detonate. It is advised to remove this racks to increase survivability of the platform. As with previous Russian light armor, the best armor is to not be seen by the enemy.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Alloy ABT-102 (Hull, turret)\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=775|rbMinHp=442}}The Sprut-D leaves nothing to expect, high mobility and country-cross capabilities with a very powerful engine and reliable transmission. As seen in tanks based on the BMP-3 hull, the T/W ratio is impressive, giving a lightly armored vehicle a very high max speed as well as torque to advance even through the roughest of terrains. As its predecessor, it can reach speeds up to 70 km/h and 20 km/h on reverse with a gear change time from max forward drive to reverse in close to 5 seconds. It holds the ability to cross over water bodies, giving it an advantage in reaching positions no other vehicles are able to reach whatsoever. It has the ability to neutral steer, a feature not seen often in Russian vehicles.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

While it doesn't fire the 3BM60 'Svinets-2' as the T-80BVM or the T-72B3, it fires the 3BM46 'Svinets-1' which is a very capable round in game. While it stays short compared to other rounds seen at top-tier, at 10.0 it is the best round seen followed by the M900. This round is able to pierce through all the tanks seen in game with some exceptions as the Leopard 2PL/A5/A6 turrets or M1A1/A2 turrets.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[2A75 (125 mm)|125 mm 2A75]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It holds primarily 3 uses:\n\n'''Scouting:'''\n\nAs its name says, scouting. When on large maps, the scouting ability should be used at its full potential. The low profile and high speed make it able to crawl to cover fast and without creating much suspicion, while marking targets for friendlies to engage.\n\n'''Flanking:'''\n\nDue to the high speed and really powerful gun, it can be used to hit any enemy from behind. This tactic should be a \"Hit n' Run\", you should disable or destroy targets and leave before they can engage you. The powerful gun can take the heaviest of targets with ease if used properly\n\n'''Sniping:'''\n\nThe capable optics, in combination with laser range finder and thermal optics, it is able to detect, target and engage enemy vehicles at all ranges thanks to any of its projectiles. Be aware of your ammo as it can only carry 22 on the carousel which can be consumed very fast, so make all shots count. Unless the commander is certain it has not been detected, moving between positions is adviced to ensure survivability, especially when the player respawns as an aircraft and is aware of the {{PAGENAME}}'s position.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
