In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Winged Lions\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe survivability of the 2S3M is a very situational one. Due to having absolutely no effective armor to stop any munition but small firearms, it is very vulnerable to all damage. However, solid shots such as APCR have a chance to go right through the armor without making any damage whatsoever. The armor of the 2S3M can also partially stop artillery strikes fragmentation depending on the distance between the explosion and the platform. The best armor of the 2S3M is not to be seen. As a howitzer with a very potent weapon, it should be never stay stationary after firing, as this can disclose the location of the platform and be killed.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\nThe 2S3M is not exactly agile, but it is nowhere near being \"tanky\". It takes time to accelerate and brake due to the heavy weight of the main gun, but reaches the top speed fairly easily. It holds a max speed of 60 km/h which is fast for a vehicle. As it is based on the SU-100P hull, it has a very decent turn rate and reverse speed, being able to reach up to 13 km/h while on reverse, faster than almost any Russian vehicle seen at the game. It has a very capable cross-country capability and when track module is researched, it is able to hold a much better turn radius compared to any other Russian vehicle in game.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=739|rbMinHp=460}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|2A33 (152 mm)}}\n\nThe 2S3M has access to the 152 mm 2A33 howitzer, a very potent gun with a significant firepower. It is the only howitzer in game capable of firing HEAT and ACBC rounds. The performance of the gun leaves nothing to expect, decent muzzle velocity for rounds as well as a slow but steady aiming speed. While it is slower in performance compared to the Type 75 SHP or the Bkan 1C, it holds one of the most devastating rounds in game: the 3OF25. Holding more than 10 kg of TNT equivalent explosive mass, it is able to annihilate any ground vehicle with almost any hit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[2A33 (152 mm)|152 mm 2A33]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Teammates should be supported with the power of this weapon as well as the variety of projectiles available to it. It is not to be played as a frontline vehicle due to the immense reload time and aiming of the weapon. However it is a very good guerilla combatant and skirmisher if used as a backup for frontline vehicles.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
