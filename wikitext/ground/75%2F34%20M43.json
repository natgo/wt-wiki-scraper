If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Combat tactics\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is best when used as a tank destroyer thanks to its good frontal armour and the good penetration of its rounds, provided you stay at a distance guaranteeing your survivability (800-1,000 m). With a maximum penetration of 64 mm at 1,000 m for the APCBC round and 100 mm for the HEAT shell, the vehicle will have no problem penetrating the armour of most enemy vehicles at the BR.\n\nIf you play too close to the frontline, most tanks will be capable of disabling you. Your weak sides will be exposed if you are taken in a pincer move and being immobilized with the enemy close to your position pretty much seals your vehicle's fate.\n\n;Notable enemies:\n\n* Tank destroyers with long guns that can penetrate from long range like the [[M10 (Family)|M10]], the Marder III, the Sd.Kfz.234/4, the StuG III F, the SU-57B, the ASU-57, the YaG-10 (29-K), the Gun Carrier (3-in), the Archer, the Na-To, the 90/53 M41M or the Pvkv II.\n* Tanks with powerful HEAT shells like the M4A3 (105), the Pz.III N, the StuH 42 G, the 105/25 M43 or the Sav m/43 (1946),\n* Heavily armoured tanks that can shrug your shells off like the MK-II \"Matilda\" (USSR), the KV-1 (L-11), the Churchill I or the Matilda III,\n* Frontline tanks with sloped armour like the M4, the M4A1, the [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]], the Sherman II, the M4A4 or the ARL-44 (ACL-1),\n* Fast and agile light tanks such as the [[M24 (Family)|M24]], that can easily flank the Semovente undetected are dangerous threats. Their speed and small size make them difficult to target for the Semovente's gun and they can disable you easily at close range.\n\n;How to defeat a {{PAGENAME}}\n\n* Avoid any frontal encounter. Flank it and aim for the sides of the casemate.\n* Wait for it to have shot and be reloading (it gives you at least 6 seconds to act).\n* If you're forced to engage the Semovente frontally, be as close as possible to increase your chances to penetrate.\n* If you can't disable it in one shot, immobilizing the {{PAGENAME}} buys you time to finish it off. Either shoot the transmission, the driver or the engine to do so. Stay out or get out of its line of fire once it is immobilized.\n* When flying an aircraft, target the crew compartment to knock the crew out or the engine bay to immobilize it.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Effective frontal armour and all-around protection\n* Small frontal profile makes the tank easy to conceal and difficult to hit\n* Decent mobility and good hull traverse\n* Has access to HEAT rounds\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Armour becomes much less effective when uptiered against stronger vehicles\n* As a casemate tank destroyer, the Semovente is extremely vulnerable to flanks\n* A cramped interior and only 3 crew lessens survivability\n* Inadequate gun for its tier\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
