In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has the same protection as the 75/34 M43 but sits at a higher battle rating, reducing its effectiveness. While still effective against earlier guns, it will begin to encounter enemies with weapons that can easily defeat its armour, such as the American 76 mm M1 or British QF 17-pounder. The upper glacis will be easily penetrated by these guns, and the superstructure, while more heavily protected, will similarly be easily penetrated, and due to the confined nature of the fighting compartment likely result in destruction of the vehicle. The lower glacis is easily penetrated at closer ranges, however the transmission will typically absorb most of the damage. Angling can be used to increase the effectiveness of the superstructure, however exposed cheeks become a weak spot for enemies to target. Using an obstacle to hide the vehicles cheeks while angling is important to maintain effective armour.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, casemate)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The vehicle has an average reverse speed, reaching -6 km/h in its single gear. Despite its lack of neutral steering, the {{PAGENAME}} can traverse its hull reasonably quickly from a full stop, greatly helping to overcome its lack of a turret.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=263|rbMinHp=164}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Semovente's lack of turret and unreliable armour lend it a less aggressive role; at a distance, the limited traverse is less a handicap and makes it harder for the weak spots of the vehicle to be hit. The vehicle's primary advantages, its low profile and powerful gun, also add to this, as it can defeat most enemies it will encounter at range while remaining a relatively obscured target. Using the vehicle's gun depression and low profile to take advantage of terrain, such as a rock, building, or hill, will make it harder to hit, increasing its survivability. Against weaker enemies, such as vehicles equipped with the American 75 mm M3, it can more aggressively expose itself, but care must be taken in case the M43's mobility is impaired or against vehicles with more powerful guns.\n\nThe 75 mm OTO 75/43 mod.40 gun can defeat most enemies at its ranking, with only some heavier tanks able to effectively resist the gun, such as the [[Churchill VII]] or the uparmoured [[KV-1 (ZiS-5)]]. In this case, waiting for the enemy to expose a vulnerable area of their armour or identifying them for allies to target is ideal. Attempting to flank or more aggressively approach should be avoided. If facing higher ranked vehicles, more caution must be used, as there will be more enemies able to resist your fire while being able to defeat your own armour. Knowledge of appropriate weak spots can help defeating vehicles like the [[M4A3E2]] Jumbo or [[IS-1]] tanks, but these may be unreliable, meaning a more cautious approach is safer.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.
