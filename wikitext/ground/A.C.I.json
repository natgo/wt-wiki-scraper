In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Winged Lions\"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7469-event-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2021 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R.]] event.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nIn general, the A.C.I is very good at head-on engagements, due to its very well armoured front for its BR. The sides are with a thickness of only around 45 mm relatively good penetrable at 2.7. Tanks using large-calibre HE shells are dangerous, because of the overpressure mechanics that will often take out the driver and the machine gunner as well as the transmission. The lower front is quite vulnerable, if shot, the transmission will most likely break down, the crew won't take damage usually.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The weak gun however forces you to come close to your targets to get a chance to penetrate. The armour is best used in combination with the A.C.I's good mobility.\n\nNotable enemies include the Panzer III, the Marder III H and the early T-34s.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
