In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''', also designated in-game as the '''{{PAGENAME}}''', is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the initial British tree line in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]] and was the prize in the [[wt:en/news/3477--en|2015 \"Christmas gift\"]] giveaway. At some point, it was given for free if you chose Britain as your first nation when you started the game.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof\n|-\n| Hull || 14 mm ''Front plate'' <br> 14 mm (0-62°) ''Front glacis'' <br> 14 mm (64°) ''Lower glacis'' || 7 + 7 mm || 14 mm (0-62°) || 14 mm\n|-\n| Turret || 14 mm (0-15°) ''Turret front'' <br> 14 mm (1-63°) ''Gun mantlet'' || 14 mm (21°) || 14 mm (2°) || 14 mm\n|-\n| Cupola || 14 mm || 14 mm || 14 mm || 14 mm\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Notes:'''\n\n* Suspension wheels and tracks are 15 mm thick while the torsion bars in between the side armour are 10 mm thick.\n* Hoisting points and optics covers are 14mm thick.\n* The sides of the hull benefit from spaced armour (2 x 7 mm spaced ~10 cm apart) but the thickness of the plates is too poor to properly act as such: HEAT and HE shells have no problem defeating it.\n* 2 smoke launchers are installed on the right side of the turret. Smoke grenades can be launched individually in the direction the gun is pointing at, 50 m away from your tank. The reload sequence takes places once both launchers are empty.\n* The {{PAGENAME}} is among the least armoured tanks in the game. Be aware that even when angling, most enemies can reliably penetrate you from 1,000 m distance.\n* Even when only exposing the turret of your tank to shoot at an enemy, you can receive devastating damage as your thinly armoured turret is pretty wide and contains 3 crew members out of 4.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=527|rbMinHp=301}}\n\nThe acceleration is good and the top speed is in line with light tanks at the same BR. The reverse speed is slow and won't let you overextend. The tracks are narrow, which gives the {{PAGENAME}} poor handling on soft terrain (snow, mud, sand). The tracks are also long, which causes the tank to understeer and lose a lot of speed when turning. All this combined with the lack of neutral steering makes turning on the spot slow.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|QF 2-pounder (40 mm)}}\n\nThe cannon loses accuracy and penetration power quickly over distance. The accuracy loss is noticeable as soon as 500 m distance and becomes a handicap over 700 m. Penetration at close range is good but becomes ineffective at 500 m and beyond. The high muzzle velocity allows for rather flat trajectories but targeting enemies at long range will be hindered by the loss of accuracy.\n\nVertical stabilizer (shoulder stop) allows you to fire when moving at slow pace (a few km/h). The turret traverse speed is average but rather slow when compared than other tanks at the same BR. The depression angle is very important and allows you to shoot easily from behind a ridge. Recoil is barely noticeable. The reload time is very short, allowing you to shower your enemies with a continuous rain of shells. Targeting procedure is quick and simple.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[QF 2-pounder (40 mm)|40 mm QF 2-pounder]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Use it preferably when enemies are at close range.\n\nProjectiles without explosive filler will most of the time incapacitate enemy tanks and require a second shot to properly knock them out. Knowledge of the positions of crew members in the targeted tank is crucial when playing with solid shots.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | '''Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)'''\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 AP/T || AP || 72 || 68 || 52 || 37 || 27 || 19\n|-\n| Shot Mk.IXB APCBC/T || APCBC || 89 || 86 || 77 || 66 || 57 || 50\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 APHV/T || AP || 80 || 75 || 58 || 41 || 30 || 21\n|-\n| Shell Mk.1 AP/T || APHE || 66 || 62 || 49 || 36 || 26 || 20\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 AP/T || AP || 792 || 1.08 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.IXB APCBC/T || APCBC || 792 || 1.24 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 APHV/T || AP || 853 || 1.08 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| Shell Mk.1 AP/T || APHE || 792 || 1.08 || 1.2 || 9 || 20.9 || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks A13 Mk I.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 1.99.0.51''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis vehicle's role is that of a light tank in the truest sense, sporting an acceptable gun, great mobility and virtually no armour to speak of.\n\nThis tank has a very active playstyle and should not be used in the front lines. Instead, use your mobility to your advantage: Spot, flank and provide artillery support for your teammates, blind your enemies with well-placed smokes screens in key avenues. Make sure to only target secluded enemies in flanking tactics so you can take full advantage of the element of surprise and outflank your opponent. Never expose yourself for too long because even anti-aircraft guns are a potential threat to your non-angled armour. The [[Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40 mm)|QF 2-pounder]] has an awfully long-range accuracy so you must get close to your enemies to actually land a shot where you expect. Load up this agile (but reluctant) cat with ammo and flank your enemies with a constant flow of bullets.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Martel, an advocate of the tanks, and developer of the concept of \"tankettes\", witnessed a tank demonstration in 1936 that had Soviet designs. The one that attracted his attention was the [[BT-5|BT light tank]]. The BT's use of the Christie suspension had Martel argue for the usage of the same suspension in their tank designs, to which the British government complied with the purchase and licensing of the system from the Nuffield Organization.\n\nThe acquired vehicle from the purchase of the Christie suspension was labelled as the ''A13E1'' and became part of the design development under the designation ''Cruiser Mk III (A13)''. The General Staff requested for the vehicle to have 30 mm of armour, a 2-pounder gun, and a road speed of 48 km/h. The original vehicle was extensively reworked due to many interior and mechanical issues. Until the tank design was finished, the British Army adopted the ''Cruiser Mk I (A9)'' tank for use, but these tanks were delayed due to the A13's near completion. The first prototype was delivered in 1937 under the name ''A13E2'', this featured the turret from the A9 cruiser tank, with a 2-pounder and a Vickers machine gun. The armour on the prototype was 15 mm and the design could reach a top speed under a governor of 48 km/h (64 km/h ungoverned). The last and revised design was the ''A13E3'' that became adopted by the British Army and ordered into production in 1939. The General Staff specification number for the tank was the '''A13 Mk. I, Cruiser Tank Mark III'''. 65 of these tanks were ordered from the Nuffield Mechanization & Aero Limited, to which 30 were built before the War Office decided to upgrade the A13 Mk.I with more armour than the '' [[A13 Mk II|A13 Mk.II, Cruiser Tank Mk IV]]''. Some of the A13 Mk.I Cruiser Mk III was also converted into Mk IV to stay modernized.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe A13 first saw combat in the Battle of France under the British Expeditionary Force in 1940. The A13 encountered many troubles during its employment, the crew having little to no training with the new tanks due to their rushed adoption into service. The tanks were in poor condition and some were even missing parts. The A13s were used in the 1st Armoured Division, but many were either destroyed by the superior German armoured forces or abandoned at Calais during the evacuation of Allied troops at Dunkirk, which forced the units to leave behind their heavier equipment.\n\nAfter the disaster at France, the A13 were still used to support the war. Some were sent to Greece to support their defence against Germany in the Battle of Greece, but a majority were sent to North Africa as part of the Western Desert Campaign near Libya under the 7th Armoured Division. Compared to the time in France, the A13s in North Africa fared much better, ironing out most of its initial defects, and was even more suited to the environment than other tank designs. The A13 was popular with the crew for its high speed, reliability, and a powerful 2-pounder cannon that could engage a majority of Axis tanks in 1941. However, there was an insufficient number of A13s available for use, so tank units were mixed with the faster cruiser tanks and slower infantry tanks, which caused tactical and logistical difficulties trying to accommodate all of the tanks. Another deficiency with the tank and every other British tank with the 2-pounder was the lack of high-explosive shell issued to the tankers, which made them vulnerable to anti-tank guns, which caused a majority of British tank losses in the North African Campaign. Still, the A13 fared very well with its armour and armament until late 1941 where better armoured [[Pz.III L|Panzer IIIs]] and [[Pz.IV G|Panzer IVs]] began to appear on the battlefield.\n\nDue to its growing obsolescence on the battlefield, the A13 was replaced in 1941 by the better armoured [[Crusader Mk II|A15 Crusader tank]].\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_a_13_mk1_3rd_rtr Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|tp7_VTC3FoE|'''{{PAGENAME}} Review.
