It was added as a [[wt:en/news/3472--en|premium pack]] in  [[Update 1.53 \"Firestorm\"]] and was one of the first British tanks introduced in the game. It was available for purchase during the early stages of the British tanks introduction, but was removed from the Gaijin store in [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/311904-clearance-sale-50-off-various-packs33 May 2016]. It has since been available for purchase during the [[wt:en/news/4608-news-a-revolt-in-war-thunder-discount-is-over-en|2017 \"April Fools\" sale]] and as a reward vehicle for [[wt:en/news/6442-special-war-thunder-reaches-its-7th-year-en|War Thunder's 7th Anniversary]] event. It was also made available in [[wt:en/news/6120-news-how-can-you-get-premium-vehicles-warbonds-en|April 2019]] as a battle trophy vehicle in the [[Warbonds]] shop. It is now only obtainable through the [[War Thunder Market|Marketplace]].\n\nAs a British Cruiser style tank the {{Specs|name}} focuses on mobility, agility and flanking. Armour is in this concept is literal dead weight and foregone. Compared to the tech tree [[A13 Mk II]], this version features an additional armour plate for the turret.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This difference is quite noticeable despite their cramped conditions.\n\nFurther the A13 Mk II 1939 features an improved turret armour to the standard A13 Mk II. Another 14 mm plate was added to the turret's face. It does not make a significant difference to survivability, neither does angling the hull against incoming fire. Even machine gun fire poses a significant threat, hence the preferred means of survival (alike for all Cruiser style British tanks) is to not be seen. Luckily the low profile and small size benefit this playstyle greatly.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=527|rbMinHp=301}}\n\nEven though the {{PAGENAME}} has good mobility, it sometimes feels weird to drive. It loses speed on turns, does not accelerates quite as fast as its overpowered engine (RB stock: 20 HP/tonne) should provide it. Hill-climbing and other inclination have it struggle to pick up a proper pace. All of these flaws come from the gearbox, which has bad and uneven ratios, resulting in a kick when changing speed. Knowing that keep an eye on the \"gear\" counter top-left of the screen (activate it in the options menu) since it provides crucial information on how the tank will react to commands. With a bit of practice, one should swiftly masters these peculiarities.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|QF 2-pounder (40 mm)}}\n\nSince the QF 2-pounder is used on most British tanks of Rank I, it is important to know it well. This cannon has a major disadvantage at distances since its bullet lose around 20 mm of penetration for every 500 m it travels, which is a lot. As if this was not enough, it has poor accuracy, even with Adjustment of fire, hence, one should target large components (crewmen, engine, transmission), of the enemy or, as distance increases (500 m or more), the general centre of the foe. Firing the 2-pounder, one will easily notice its last but not least flaw: it does almost no post-penetration damage, which requires the need to snipe, crew members, one by one. Combine this difficulty with a bit of distance and this task can prove tricky pretty quick, sometimes leaving the enemy enough time to replenish its crew before being finished off.\n\nOn the other hand, this cannon has 5 major advantages: reload speed, close-quarter penetration, a primitive stabilizing system, LOTS of ammo and awesome gun depression. Its fast reloading speed allows the 2-Pounder to compensate its poor accuracy: missed a shot? why not take another even before you can reposition! Close quarter penetration, one of the best at its tier, is also a plus: enemies will only block a shot if it happen to hit a steep-angled plate of armour. With the hand stabilizer it can fire on the move too, at low speeds and on relatively flat road, though. Doing so it is much more precise than the comparable [[BT-7]] with the [[20-K (45 mm)|20-K]]. Last but not least, small shells mean more shells: the A13 can bring up to 87 bullets into the game, much more than needed to knock out 3-4 tanks, which means one can try to suppress an enemy and keep it in cover by constantly firing near it (at this rank, this tactic can prove effective against new players). Finally, the great gun depression enables it to fire over hills, peeking only it's a small turret, shooting and disappearing swiftly. Use these features cunningly.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[QF 2-pounder (40 mm)|40 mm QF 2-pounder]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The APCBC, APHV and the APHE \"Shell Mk.1\" all fill different niches. The APCBC has great performance at close range and against angled slopes. It does well for sniping modules up to medium ranges, but is here quickly outshined by the APHV shot. Depending on the map size, several of these should be kept as back up for combat above 500 m. Ultimatively the Shell Mk.1 APHE is objectively the hardest hitting of the bunch with the explosive filler. However the penetration goes down to an average 60 mm @ 100 m which unlike the other shots requires aiming for weakpoint more often. The delay can be unwanted in close range combat, but so is an enemy able to shoot back. As the HE filler is underwhelming in firepower, larger vehicles such as the [[Pz.IV C]] and [[LVT(A)(1)|LVT]] will survive initial hits. Given the British tech tree's tendency for solid AP shot, sticking with the APCBC shot for training purposes might be for the best. The lack of a dedicated high explosive shell is negligible as the small bore diameter would have rendered it quite impotent, the coaxial LMG does the job adequately already.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | '''Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)'''\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 AP/T || AP || 72 || 68 || 52 || 37 || 27 || 19\n|-\n| Shot Mk.IXB APCBC/T || APCBC || 89 || 86 || 77 || 66 || 57 || 50\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 APHV/T || AP || 80 || 75 || 58 || 41 || 30 || 21\n|-\n| Shell Mk.1 AP/T || APHE || 66 || 62 || 49 || 36 || 26 || 20\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 AP/T || AP || 792 || 1.08 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.IXB APCBC/T || APCBC || 792 || 1.24 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 APHV/T || AP || 853 || 1.08 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| Shell Mk.1 AP/T || APHE || 792 || 1.08 || 1.2 || 9 || 20.9 || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks A13 Mk I.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 1.77.2.128''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

While this correlates in a wide field of view, beneficial for the close-quarters combat style of the A13, it is a major downside for medium and long range battles. Without the binoculars (or the penetration indicator in Arcade Mode) any far ranged combat becomes a sore to the eyes. Yet this is great training for spotting hostiles with the binoculars and aligning the gun to the target.\n\n=== Machine guns ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles.

The main difference from the Mk II to the Mk I is that the former has better turret protection, adding about 0.8 tonnes of steel without hindering mobility.\n\nThe A13 has a very active playstyle and should not be used in the front lines. Instead, use the mobility to its advantage: Spot, flank and provide artillery support for the team, blind enemies with well-placed smokes screens in key avenues. Make sure to only target secluded enemies in flanking tactics to take full advantage of the element of surprise and outflank opponents. Never expose yourself for too long , as even light machine gun fire is a potential threat to survivability . The QF-2 pounder has an awful long-range accuracy, so get close to the enemy to actually land a shot. Load up this agile (but reluctant) cat with ammo and flank the enemies with a constant flow of bullets.\n\nSince the addition of smoke in War Thunder, light tanks have it easier. Use the forward-launching smoke to create a wall of smoke in a strategic place. It can be used to cover allies, when capturing a point, flanking in a street (urban environment), or when the situation gets to hot.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The tank underwent a development program under the name ''Cruiser Mk III (A13)'' and the first accepted variant for the military was the ''[[A13 Mk I|A13 Mk.I]]''. The Mk.I featured 15 mm of armour, a 2-pounder cannon, and a Vickers machine gun as its coaxial armament. An order of 65 of these tanks were asked for in 1939 at the Nuffield Mechanization & Auto Limited, but only 30 were made before the a decision was made to upgrade the existing model with more armour and different armament.\n\nThe redesigned cruiser tank, the '''A13 Mk.II, Cruiser Tank Mk IV''', had a new armour thickness of 30 mm and additional sloping armour was put onto the sides and rear of the turret. The Vickers machine gun used as the coaxial armament was also replaced by the BESA machine gun, a licensed Czech ZB-53 machine gun, due to issues with the Vickers gun. Around 225 to 665 A13 Mk.II tanks were produced from 1940 until late 1941.\n\n===Combat Usage===\nThe A13 first saw combat in the Battle of France under the British Expeditionary Force in 1940. The A13 encountered many trouble during its employment, the crew have little to no training with the new tanks due to their rushed adoption into service, the tanks were in poor condition and some were even missing parts. The A13s were used in the 1st Armoured Division, but many were either destroyed by the superior German armoured forces or abandoned at Calais during the evacuation of Allied troops at Dunkirk, which forced the units to leave behind their heavier equipment.\n\nAfter the disaster at France, the A13 were still used to support the war. Some were sent to Greece to support their defense against Germany in the Battle of Greece, but a majority were sent to North Africa as part of the Western Desert Campaign near Libya under the 7th Armoured Division. Compared to the time in France, the A13s in North Africa fared much better, ironing out most of its initial defects, and was even more suited to the environment than other tank designs. The A13 was popular with the crew for its high speed, reliability, and a powerful 2-pounder cannon that could engage a majority of Axis tanks in 1941. However, there was an insufficient number of A13s available for use, so tank units were mixed with the faster cruiser tanks and slower infantry tanks, which caused tactical and logistical difficulties trying to accommodate all of the tanks. Another deficiency with the tank and every other British tank with the 2-pounder was the lack of high-explosive shell issued to the tankers, which made them vulnerable to anti-tank guns, which caused a majority of British tank losses in the North African Campaign. Still, the A13 fared very well with its armour and armament until the late 1941 where better armoured [[Pz.III L|Panzer IIIs]] and [[Pz.IV G|Panzer IVs]] began to appear on the battlefield.\n\nDue to its growing obsolescence on the battlefield, the A13 was replaced in 1941 by the better armoured [[Crusader Mk II|A15 Crusader tank]].\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_a_13_mk2_1939 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|4_cJ1CpEatw|'''Best gun depression''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:33 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related British Cruiser style tanks\n* [[Crusader (Family)|Crusader series]]\n* [[Tetrarch Mk I]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/827|[Devblog] Pioneering British Tanks in War Thunder with developer's answers]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Cruiser_Mk_IV|[Wikipedia] Cruiser Mk IV (A13 Mk II)]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Nuffield}}\n{{Britain light tanks}}\n{{Britain premium ground vehicles}}"}}
