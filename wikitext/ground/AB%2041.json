From the front an inexperienced enemy may shoot the turret, which is the most heavily armoured portion, but even that is easy to penetrate by all anti-tank weapons. From the side many shots will over penetrate, killing only two of the four crew members at most; from the side the crew is well spaced out. From the front the crew members are lined up, making it an easy one shot kill. The ammunition stowage is a large target from the side, but it will not always explode when hit.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Combat tactics\n\nEven though the armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is lacking, if played to its advantages it can become a vital part of achieving victory over the other team. This armoured car has 2 main things going for it: a very good mobility and a very effective, fast-firing autocannon that can decimate enemies at close to medium range.\n\nWith these advantages in mind, there are several playstyles for this vehicle:\n\n* The first option is to play a harasser role. Using the excellent mobility, the {{PAGENAME}} can get to the best positions on the map early and ambush enemy vehicles. Once you have struck and taken an enemy out, use the mobility to relocate to a new position and repeat the process.\n* A second option is to use this vehicle to flank the enemy tanks while your teammates face them. Using your speed and mobility, you go around to take the enemy in a pincer movement.\n* As third option, you can play it so as to get to cap zones before the other teams do, and afterwards use your vehicle as a support tank along with your teammates tanks taking up a position behind them and overextending when needed.\n\nIn addition to these roles, the AB 41 can be used against airplanes with its 20 mm autocannon.\n\n;Notable opponents:\n\n* [[S.35]] - Very well armoured but slow (flank if possible)\n* [[B1 bis]] - Very well armoured for its BR and can be very dangerous with several cannons (avoid if possible)\n* [[T-70]] / [[T-80]] - Strong frontal armour that will be hard to penetrate (but thinner side and rear armour), if you find yourself fighting one of these try to flank its position and catch it off guard.\n* Most tanks of this tier can be penetrated easily by your autocannon, but be careful as some of these tanks will carry .50 cal machine guns which can penetrate your armour.\n\n;Defeating the {{PAGENAME}}:\n\nBeing a very lightly armoured vehicle, it remains a vehicle easy to destroy: the 2 quickest ways to deal with the {{PAGENAME}} are autocannons and HEAT/HE projectiles. But any shell with explosive filler will do.\nAvoid close quarters and engage from long distance to increase your armour advantage while decreasing the {{PAGENAME}}'s firepower.\nYou can also force your opponent to play on a terrain hindering its mobility (mud, snow, sand) to negate its main advantage. Aim for the driver or the engine to immobilize it, meaning almost certain death for an armoured car.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Reasonably fast on flat paved terrain especially roads\n* Good acceleration\n* Much quicker than other tracked competitors because it can steer both sides at 45° angle\n* Can take very sharp turns at low speed\n* Unlocks potent PzGr 40 APCR belt that is identical to the German 20 mm autocannons, giving it impressive close range penetration\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* The armour protection is only barely adequate at stopping rifle-calibre bullets, everything else will shred it\n* Off-road mobility is lacklustre\n* Sharp turns make it prone to tipping over\n* Only 8 rounds per magazine, which is quickly expended\n* Long reload for a small magazine\n* Individual shells don't do much internal damage upon penetration\n* PzGr 40 belt requires unlocking a tier IV modification\n* Default belt is 50/50 API-T and HEF-T Shells\n* API-T rounds struggle at longer ranges or even at slightly angled armour\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The {{PAGENAME}} had a 4x4 layout, with four-wheel steering and fully independent suspension. The freely rotating spare wheels, positioned midway along the sides of the hull, prevented the vehicle from bellying out when crossing obstacles. It also had a rear driver position. The AB 40 had 2 coaxial machine guns in the turret and a third rear-facing machine gun. The AB 41 had the 20 mm gun in place of one of the turret machine guns, and also had an increase in engine horsepower over the other design. In total 24 AB 40 and 560 AB 41s were built. They served in the reconnaissance units of armoured, motorized and cavalry divisions, as well as in independent recon companies and platoons, with 4 vehicles per platoon. The AB 40s only were used in North Africa, but AB 41s were active on all fronts, including 30 sent to Russia.\n\nThe Germans seized 37 AB 41 and another 20 in production when Italy fell in 1943. They used these, along with 102 AB 43s converted back to a 20 mm main gun, and known as AB 41/43s.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_ab_41 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|XKdfhUHK81Y|'''What is more important: Rate of fire or Penetration?
