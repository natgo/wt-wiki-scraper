It also has proximity fuse in the case it misses, making it far more effective and easier to use in the AA role against jets\n* Missiles can penetrate about 800 mm of composite armour at 30° angle and have nearly 8 kg of explosive mass which allows them to overpressure nearly anything through the weakspots, extremely lethal against NATO tank hull roof\n* Missiles have a range of 10 km and are very fast from the start, with maximum speed of 1,000 m/s, which make them suitable for long range sniping\n* Lower profile than the American [[ADATS]], especially with the radar folded down and missile launchers can elevate higher than the ones on the American ADATS due to a lack of autocannon\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Really fragile, can be blown up by hitting the ammo rack, hull can be penetrated by autocannons and high-calibre machine guns\n* Only 8 missiles and tank cannot rearm until used all of them. In AB, the {{PAGENAME}} will automatically rearm anywhere after using all of the missiles and it takes approximately 120 seconds, in RB {{PAGENAME}} can rearm on a capture point which takes about 50 seconds. Even after rearming, missiles must also be reloaded which takes another 20-15 seconds. All in all, it is almost guaranteed that you will be found and destroyed during that time \n* Due to a lack of the 25 mm gun found on the American ADATS, the Canadian ADATS is also incapable of self-defense during rearm and is less flexible overall\n* Missiles are not as effective against ERA tanks, which ADATS will have to constantly face, so if operator does not aim perfectly, they will only realistically take out 4 tanks instead of 8\n* Long antennas might give out your position in RB/SB\n* Just -4 degrees of launcher depression\n* Smoke launchers are mounted on the front of the vehicle - hull must face the direction of smokescreen deployment, no ESS\n* The M113 chassis has a low hp/ton ratio - mobility is severely reduced off-road, in mud, snow, and sand, overall has low reactive mobility\n* Missiles need to travel a certain distance to arm the fuse - unable to engage enemy aerial vehicles at close range, except for a direct hit\n* Since missiles have proximity fuse, they will react to hostile rockets and missiles, then explode mid-flight. It is possible to break through the \"missile shield\" by firing multiple SAMs, but in AB helicopters either just spam rockets at Canadian ADATS or spawn so often, that it can't possibly reload in time and becomes effectively useless as SPAA (unlike Stormer HVM)\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Developed in the early 1970s by Oerlikon-Buhrle (now part of Rheinmetall), the AA system failed to see service with the countries it was intended for, namely the United States. However, the Canadian Armed Forces procured 36 ADATs vehicles based on the M113 chassis, which served with the Canadian army as anti-aircraft systems until their withdrawal in 2007.\n\n=== Design and Development ===\nIn the early 1970s, Oerlikon-Buhrle began the process of developing a new vehicle, designed for both anti-tank and anti-aircraft defence. This vehicle would later become the ADATs. In 1979, Martin-Marietta joined the design process. The vehicle was designed to compete in the FAAD (Forward Area Air Defence) competition for the US Department of Defence, which wished to replace its interim [[M163]]/M167 Vulcan Anti-Aircraft guns and the MIM-72 Corporal anti-aircraft systems. The ADATS ended up winning the competition, beating out competitors including the Franco-German-designed Roland.\n\nHowever, the ADATs encountered a number of critical issues with its operability. Namely, it had an extremely high mechanical failure rate resulting in a very low operational readiness. And, in 1990, the Cold War ended; that was the final straw for the ADATS. As a result, the US DoD cancelled the ADATS program, after almost five billion dollars of funding. Despite this, the Canadian government ordered the ADATS for their Low Level Air Defence (LLAD) program, spending 1.09 billion dollars to purchase 36 ADATS vehicles along with the necessary equipment.\n\nThe ADATS was highly unique in that it was designed for both anti-air and anti-ground defence. Based on the M113 APC chassis, the weapon system was composed of eight ADATS missiles, along with a search radar and laser missile director. The Canadian version was not fitted with the M242 Bushmaster cannon fitted to American ADATS SPAAs. The missiles themselves were laser-guided, and had a combined HEAT/HE-Frag warhead capable of penetrating 900 mm of armour. This system enabled the ADATS to destroy both tanks and helicopters from a maximum range of 10 km, or 7 km altitude.\n\n=== Operational History ===\nThe ADATS entered service with the Canadian Armed Forces in 1989, and was built by Oerlikon Aerospace, based in Quebec. The ADATS was deployed by the Canadian Armed Forces during the Gulf War. However, it never actually saw combat, and never fired a shot in anger. The ADATS was unusually expensive for an anti-aircraft vehicle, due to its large design and development costs and small order in terms of vehicles. As a result, the Canadian Armed Forces announced that they would retire the ADATS in 2006. By 2007, all ADATS vehicles had been withdrawn from Canadian service.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_adats_m113a3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== References ===\n\n* Military Today.
