In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]] along with the rest of the British tree.\n\nThis is a low rank British AA car, which, while lacking armour, can pack quite the punch. It has two 20 mm autocannons on its turret, and good manoeuvrability and speed. Unlike the AA of many other countries at this rank, this is a closed top vehicle, and performs well in anti-tank roles.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe AEC AA lacks armour, although it is protected from most smaller calibre machine guns at its battle rating. It is advisable to attempt to position yourself above an enemy, so that: A) they will have a lower ability to see you, and B) so that they will most likely end up shooting the lower part of the tank, which juts out. If they shoot here with an AP shell, it will most likely go straight through and merely take out your transmission.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Structural steel (Sand skirts)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

''Warning'': do '''not''' attempt to drive this vehicle on the snow or sand, as it will go more slowly than most heavy tanks at its BR.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The AP rounds provided will shred through almost anything, and it is always advisable to take these.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe AEC AA can be used as a support tank in most battles and excels at ambushes. It works well at holding down a capture point, or setting traps along roads. It is advisable to always stay near allies so that you can receive help if necessary. If you choose to play the original role of anti-aircraft, make sure to stay in an open (but safe) area, allowing you full range of fire. Sometimes it is advisable to \"harass\" planes by giving scattered fire to make them think you are a light tank, and then pretending you don't notice them turning to attack you. Aim down the scope until they are within firing range, and shred them to pieces before they have time to react.\n\nDue to the heavy ammunition consumption as SPAA in AA fights, stay at an allied capture point to get ammunition to reload during battle.\n\nWhen encountering an enemy that's armour can't be pierced, attempt to immobilise the vehicle by disabling the tracks. From here, multiple options are available for the {{PAGENAME}} depending on the foe. If the enemy has known weak spots, the {{PAGENAME}} could attempt to manoeuvre to a favourable position. If the enemy is known to be impervious to the {{PAGENAME}}'s armaments, simply keep them disabled (hit the gun barrel as well to increase the enemy's repair time), drop artillery, and withdraw to a safe position until a friendly with a bigger gun can handle the situation.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Excellent rate of fire\n* Fast and mobile with good acceleration\n* Closed top, can't be strafed from the sky or hit by artillery shrapnel\n* Good turret armour\n* Fast turret rotation speed\n* Good gun velocity gives good anti-air capability\n* Can decimate lightly armoured tank destroyers\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Useless against heavily armoured tanks\n* Low ammo capacity can't allow for reckless firing\n* Poor hull armour\n* Taller than other vehicles, making it a large target (easier to hit)\n* Has wheels, therefore it can't turn on the spot\n* Terrible at driving off-road and on sand or mud\n* Turret ring is fairly large, therefore it may become jammed often if hit\n* Not enough gun depression (be careful when getting up hills)\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n===Development===\nThe basis of the armoured car comes from the Associated Equipment Company (AEC) of Southall, Middlesex. AEC was a manufacturer of truck and bus chassis and the Matador artillery tractor. The armoured car was privately developed in 1941 and was based on the Matador. The design was shown to British officials in the same year during the Horse Guards Parade and was received favourably by many, including Winston Churchill. Orders started filing in for the armoured car, and AEC tried to give it comparable firepower to current tanks at the time. Thus, the first version, Mk.I, came with a turret adapted from the [[Valentine Mk I|Valentine tank]] equipped with the 2-pounder. The next version, Mk.II, had this upgraded with a heavier turret and a 6-pounder gun, then with the QF 75 mm gun on the Mk.III. An anti-aircraft version using the same turret from the [[Crusader AA Mk II]] and the twin Oerlikon guns were also developed for the armoured car. During its production life from 1942 to 1943, 629 Armoured cars in total were built.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe Armoured cars equipped with tank guns were used in North Africa in late 1942. Some on-field modifications include changing out the Valentine turret for a [[Crusader Mk III|Crusader]] turret with the 6-pounder. The armoured cars continued to see fighting in various parts of Europe in combination with other armoured cars and remained in service until replaced by the Alvis Saladin in 1958.\n\nThough the anti-aircraft version was made, it never entered production due to the growing Allied air superiority over the Axis forces, making the anti-aircraft version unnecessary to guard the advancing Allied units from air attacks.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_armored_car_mk_2_aa Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/854/|[Devblog] T17E2 and Armoured Car Mk II SPAA]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AEC}}\n{{Britain anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
