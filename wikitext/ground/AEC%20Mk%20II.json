In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]] in the [[wt:en/news/5224-special-festive-quest-en|2017 \"Festive Quest\"]] that took place between 22 December 2017 to 22 January 2018. It was obtained by completing 7 tanker's Christmas toys.\n\nThe AEC Mk II is similar to the [[AEC AA]], with a different turret housing a 57 mm 6-pounder cannon rather than two synchronized Oerlikon 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons. As such, the vehicle has a lower profile than its predecessor, which grants it more stealth capabilities. In addition, there is a 7.62 mm BESA machine gun for use, which is nice for dealing with lightly armoured targets such as open-topped anti-aircraft vehicles and SPGs.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=256|rbMinHp=146}}\n\nBeing an armoured car, the {{PAGENAME}} is a light vehicle. It accelerates quickly and has a good cruise speed on hard surfaces (solid ground, roads). While your top speed is high, your cruise speed will be around 50 km/h. As it is equipped with tires, the {{PAGENAME}} struggles on soft terrain (sand, mud, snow). The reverse speed is also poor for a light armoured car.\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is average at fording: 17 km/h and loses quickly speed when driving uphill.\nAnother important point to take into account is the turn radius: like all WW2 wheeled vehicles, you can not turn on the spot and always need space to change direction. The bigger the speed, the bigger the turn radius. You will also need more distance to come to a full stop and braking while turning will cause your vehicle to go into an uncontrolled skid.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Due to the high speed and thin armour, it is ill-advised to use this vehicle in frontal assaults. Added to the new mechanic of active scouting for light tanks, it is rewarding to be an effective scout by highlighting targets for allies, thus farming SP and experience from their assistance. However, the AEC isn't as small as a scout-like the American M22 Locust, so scouting and flanking can be risky if done incorrectly. That being said, the AEC also have the same 6-Pounder cannon found on the Crusader Mk III, Churchill Mk III, Cromwell Mk I and the Valentine Mk IX, so the AEC has a fast rate-of-fire with an excellent muzzle velocity. Here are some methods for maximizing not only combat effectiveness but also the chances of surviving.\n\nThe first method of using this vehicle is for reconnaissance. Since the addition of the \"active scouting\" mechanic, light tanks have the ability to report the position of enemy vehicles to allies. When fulfilling the role of scouting in this vehicle, find a position that is concealed, but that gives a clear view sight of the battlefield. This is most helpful for farming Spawn Points and experience given that when an allied vehicle destroys an enemy player being actively scouted, granting a 50% reward of what the allied player was awarded. This can work best when paired with allied tank destroyers for dislodging stubborn enemy defenders holding down key positions.\n\nThe second method of using this vehicle is flanking. When using this as a flanker, try to use the terrain for the advantage and end up on the enemy's flank. Coupled with the AEC's fast speed, it shouldn't be too difficult to get up to speed if the terrain is favourable, as muddy terrain will severely inhibit the ability to manoeuvre. After all, the AEC is still a wheeled vehicle, so don't expect to speed overall terrains as in a tank. Nonetheless, when on the enemy's flank, ensure that it is a spot that isn't as exposed as others. Then, start pumping shots into the sides of the enemy tanks. It is highly recommended to fire a few shots then relocate, thus preventing the enemy from triangulating the AEC's firing location. It doesn't hurt to use \"active scouting\" as well, to notify allies of an incoming enemy armour movement.\n\nWith very light armour, this renders the AEC vehicle highly exposed to any form of enemy fire ''except'' machine gunfire. However, at the Battle-Rating of 3.0, there are some adversaries that deserve special note.\n\n*'''German Vehicles'''\n\nThe AEC's greatest adversary is most likely the [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV F2]], due to its long-barreled 75 mm cannon, which can punch right through the armour- even from long range. In addition, any later model of the [[Pz.III M|Panzer III]] is going to give severe problems due to their long-barreled 50 mm cannon, which has a rapid rate-of-fire. As laughable as it sounds, the [[Flakpanzer_I|Flakpanzer I]] and the [[Flakpanzer_38|Gepard]] will also shred the AEC, as a result of their ability to use the HVAP-T round for their 20 mm cannons, which have a murderous rate-of-fire. In Battle-Rating 3.3 matches, stay away from a [[Wirbelwind|Flakpanzer Wirbelwind]] at all costs, as the sheer volume of their fire will utterly obliterate the AEC, even if they do not have the HVAP-T round. The most dangerous opponent in respect to the AEC is the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2|Sd.Kfz.234/2 \"Puma,\"]] due to its amazing speed and a high-velocity 50 mm cannon. The [[Marder_III|Marder]] [[Marder III H|series]] will also give issues, due to their high-velocity cannons.\n\n*'''Soviet Vehicles'''\n\nThe Soviets have the most tanks with heavy armour, which can make it difficult for even for the 6-Pounder to punch through. That being said, a [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1]] is going to give a lot of problems, even at close ranges. In addition to that, the most abundant Soviet threat is going to be the [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]], due to its fast speed and sloping armour, which has the chances to bounce a shell, even at close range, if the tank is angled well enough. The most dangerous opponent is the [[SU-122]], due to the 122 mm howitzer it carries, which doesn't need to make a direct hit if firing High-Explosive shells. In addition, the [[YaG-10 (29-K)|29-K]] boasts a high-velocity 76 mm cannon, which will tear through the AEC's armour even at long ranges.\n\n*'''Japanese Vehicles'''\n\nJapanese vehicles may not have the strongest armour for their tanks, but their guns will make anyone think twice. Most notable of these is the [[Chi-Nu|Chi-Nu]] and the [[Ho-Ni_III|Ho-Ni III]], which have high-velocity 75 mm cannons, which will rip through most armour at medium to long-range. The [[So-Ki]] SPAA can also rip through the AEC due to the twin 25 mm cannons. In addition, the [[M24 (Japan)|M24 Chaffee (Self-Defense Force)]] boasts a 75 mm cannon and a .50 Caliber machine gun, which can bore through the thin armour.\n\n*'''French Vehicles'''\n\nThe French also have some vehicles that are heavily armoured. Most notable of them being the [[B1 bis|Char B1 bis]] and the [[B1 ter|Char B1 ter]]. The Char B1 ter is probably most notable of them, due to the ridiculous amount of armour from the front. The [[SAu 40]] is a viable threat, thanks to its 75 mm cannon. It is also plausible to face the [[M4A1 (France)|French M4A1 Sherman]], which not only has enough armour to possibly bounce the 6-pdr shells but a 75 mm cannon ''and'' a .50 Caliber machine gun, which is notorious for tearing through just about any lightly-armoured vehicle. It is also important to note that the [[CCKW_353_AA|GMC CCKW (40 mm Bofors AA truck)]] is a major threat to the AEC, due to the Bofors 40 mm heavy Anti-Aircraft cannon it wields.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

(AEC) Ltd. company, which made London's double-decker buses, put forth an unsolicited design for a heavy armoured car, based on their Matador MAT (medium artillery tractor). The army was disinclined at first, but Prime Minister Churchill intervened in AEC's favour. The Mark I model carried a 2-pounder in a Valentine tank turret. Some of these were sent for use in North Africa. The Mark II, which had increased horsepower and a new three-man turret with the 6-pounder, was only produced in small numbers. Approximately 24 were given to Yugoslavian partisans in late 1944.\n\nThis would be followed by the Mark III, mounting the British 75mm gun, making it the most powerful armoured car of the war, and used in Western Europe alongside the 75mm armed US M3 GMC half-track in the heavy troop of British armoured car squadrons. A total of 122 Mark Is and 507 Mark IIs/IIIs were built.
