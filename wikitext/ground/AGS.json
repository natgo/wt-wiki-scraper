If you prefer flanking, hit the enemy with a side shot and move around them; if they have a pintle-mounted MG or autocannon, use side scraping so you don't get penetrated. If you get spotted, you have smoke grenades at your disposal: use them and pull back to allied tanks. When you run out of ammo, the only option you have is to resupply at a captured point; but if all the points are taken by the enemy then you are out of luck.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
