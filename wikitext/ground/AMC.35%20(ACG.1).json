It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. The {{PAGENAME}} has a good armament but a poor mobility for a lightly armoured vehicle. It is one of the few French vehicles in rank I to have a 2-man turret.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

The mobility is actually what makes a light tank effective. In terms of speed, this tank ''can'' be very fast...provided it's used optimally: its low power ratio makes any manoeuvre feel quite sluggish (for a light tank). Narrow tracks also makes soft terrain difficult to go through and some hills might just be too much for this poor engine.

Plus, good penetration rates (similar to those of the Russian [[20-K (45 mm)|20-K]] canon (while having no HE filler, though). With its average accuracy and post-penetration damage, this is definitely not a good sniper but it can certainly use its properties to surprise enemies by the flank.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis light tank is quite a funny little thing to play with in terms of play style and tactics to use. First of all, the armour is basically nothing, and its gun isn't the most powerful thing to tote around in (while standing out from other early French tanks for its ''normal'' reload time), though its mobility is quite okay. It is also one of the first French tank to hold '''3 crew members''' inside its hull, which grants the player a better survivability. The AMC.35 plays almost as any other light tanks, the only difference being its reduced mobility, which may be an issue when having to retreat promptly. Since the mobility is average, prefer large flanking manoeuvres and stay away from frontline action. Tactics are terrain specific.\n\n'''Urban maps:'''\n\nUrban combat presents great opportunity for light tanks to shine. Narrow streets and multiple hiding places makes this small vehicle a good ambusher. With so many obstacles on the battlefield, one can easily flank the enemy team without being noticed and make use of its gun against its opponent's sides. Don't go down in long, wide streets as anything that pops out and sees you can easily return you to hangar. Be creative, improvise and you may deliver a few good hits to unsuspecting enemies.\n\n'''\"Open\" maps:'''\n\nBeing such a small vehicle has its advantages: a simple bush can hide you very well. Engage large flanking manoeuvres and only fire if necessary as you won't survive incoming fire. Do not engage more than two enemy vehicles at once as your gun is nowhere near a one-shot machine. If many enemies come towards you, plan to relocate in advance as your poor mobility plays against you and position for ambush. Wait for allies to come and then, while their turrets are turned away from you, fire at your unsuspecting foes.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The ACG.1 was originally supposed to have equipped the three French cavalry divisions, but the first vehicles delivered to the army in 1937 were deemed unsuitable due to mechanical unreliability and rejected. As with its predecessor, lack of armour was also seen as an issue by the army. The vehicle was the first French tank with a two-man turret: initially the plan had been to use the 25mm anti-tank gun as the main armament, but due to insufficient supply this would be later changed to the same 47mm gun as the Somua and Char B1 bis, the SA 35. The Belgian Army saved the program by purchasing 12 ACG.1 in 1937. The tanks were delivered over the next two years, but without turrets. By 1939, eight turrets had also been received, which had been converted in Belgium to use the Belgian 47mm FRC M32 anti tank gun, comparable to the French SA 35, and a different coaxial machine gun and mounted on the hulls. Formed into a single squadron, they fought and were destroyed or captured during the fall of Belgium the next year.\n\nMeanwhile in France, production had resumed at a reduced rate, with something less than 50 additional vehicles produced by Renault between 1938 and 1940. Approximately 24 of these were offered to the French army and pressed into emergency service after the German breakthrough at Sedan, where they again developed a reputation for mechanical problems and limited operational range during their short service life.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amc_35 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|UQq1QueN9Y0|'''{{PAGENAME}}, French, Tier-1, Light Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|ucFHPD96VhA|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with a similar chassis\n* [[AMC.34 YR]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5238-vehicle-amc-35-steel-cavalryman-en|[Vehicle] AMC 35: Steel Cavalryman]]\n* [[wikipedia:AMC_35|[Wikipedia] AMC 35]]\n* [https://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/france/Renault_AMC-35.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Renault AMC 35]\n\n{{France light tanks}}"}}
