Its high (950 m/s) velocity gives its shells a very flat trajectory, making rangefinding a relatively easy task.\n\nThe penetration capability is acceptable, but the post-penetration damage, because of the shell type (only APC), is very light. You will have to shoot multiple times in order to destroy an enemy tank.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[SA34 L/72 (25 mm)|25 mm SA34 L/72]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It is loaded with 800 rounds organised in AP/AP/T belts, with a maximum 10 mm of penetration and a decent fire-rate and velocity. It is loaded with a pan magazine loaded with 150 rounds (100 AP and 50 T) per magazine. The machine gun is able to provide continuous fire for around 6.5 seconds before having to be reloaded, taking 6 seconds with a stock crew.\n\nThe small calibre of the MAC 31 machine gun makes it largely ineffective against all armoured vehicles but the ones with an open compartment. It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe AMD.35 is best thought of as an armoured car with a great gun. Although it has poor armour protection, like most armoured cars, it is mobile, lethal, and surprisingly survivable.\n\nIts gun is a 25 mm cannon with high penetration values. This weapon will have no problem dealing with the vast majority of enemies at this tier. Just try to stay under 300 metres of range, or else there may be significant deviation in the rounds. However be aware that the post penetration damage is quite small so it is advisable to aim for the breech or the gunner first.\n\nThis vehicle is unlike most ground vehicles in the game in that it is wheeled. Because of this, it has a great speed advantage on roads and paved surfaces. However, it has poor mobility on soft terrain, and struggles to go uphill. Even when driving on roads, quick turns cause the vehicle to lose much speed. Finally, the AMD.35 has quite ineffective brakes when stock. It is recommended that the tanker use the AMD.35's great on-road speed to quickly attain a firing position at the beginning of a match, and move quickly around the map to avoid detection. If a good firing position is found, then the AMD.35 will be able to utilise its powerful cannon to great effect.\n\nMost vehicles at this tier are poorly armoured, and this one is no exception. However, with 4 crew members it is actually quite survivable, and can usually take a few hits before being destroyed. Still, it is always best to avoid taking fire if possible, and in that regard, the AMD.35's high top speed will be a boon.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* High straight-line top speed on paved surfaces.\n* Excellent reverse gear.\n* Great penetration and shell velocity.\n* Quick reload speed.\n* High crew count and good survivability.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Poor cross-country performance.\n* Weak brakes.\n* Slow turret rotation an gun elevation.\n* Below-average gun depression.\n* Lightly armoured flanks and rear.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Designed to a 1931 specification to replace older models of armoured cars, Panhard completed a prototype in October of 1933 which was evaluated in January and February of 1934. Out of four competing models, built by Panhard, Renault, Berliet and Latil, the Panhard design was considered the best, being a highly advanced design for its time. After further trials by the French Cavalry, the Panhard 178 was accepted for production as the ''AMD Panhard Modèle 1935''. Initial use revealed some issues like engine overheating and cracking of the gun sight, resulting in a major modification program in 1937 which saw numerous modifications introduced.\n\nIn order to obtain a vehicle capable of a long-range and relatively high speed for its class, Panhard designed the 178 to be relatively light. As a result, the vehicle was relatively lightly armoured, ranging from 7 mm armour bottom plates to 13 mm flank armour and 26 mm frontal armour. As a result, the vehicle had a road speed of 72 km/h (45 mph) and a range of about 300 km (186 miles), but due to its long wheelbase and leaf-spring suspension, its off-road top speed lay at 42 km/h (26 mph) and its wading and trench-crossing capacity lay at just 60 cm (2 ft). The vehicle also had its shortcomings: it had a cramped interior, poor cross-country performance, a slow turret rotation speed and a weak clutch.\n\nUnusually for a French light reconnaissance vehicle, the Panhard 178 was equipped with a 2-man turret at a time when even most of their tanks had one-man turrets: the AP3X turret housed a commander and gunner, who had a 25 mm Hotchkiss Modèle 34 main gun and 7.5 mm Reibel coaxial machine gun at their disposal. The turret also housed a reserve machine gun which could be mounted on top for anti-aircraft defence, but which was rarely mounted in practice. The Hotchkiss gun had tungsten rounds at its disposal, capable of penetrating up to 50 mm of armour, however, these rounds performed poorly when confronted with angled armour. Already early on the poor armour-penetrating capabilities of the Hotchkiss Modèle 34 were recognised, and work was started on up-arming the AMD.35 with a 47 mm SA 35 gun. Early designs would have seen the gun fitted in the rear driver's post creating a tank-destroyer with two AT guns (the turreted Hotchkiss gun and a hull-mounted SA 35 gun), but this was abandoned in favour of a vehicle with a turreted SA 35 in an enlarged turret. Even so, by May of 1940, in the response of events in Poland, plans were already being drawn up to phase out production of the lightly armoured AMD.35 in favour of the more heavily armed and armoured AM40P.\n\nEvents decided differently, and following the German invasion of France in May of 1940, the AMD.35 proved its worth, outclassing its German counterparts. In a number of direct confrontation, German reconnaissance vehicles proved vulnerable to the Panhard's Hotchkiss gun, while their own 20 mm main gun proved ineffective against the Panhard. As a result, following the defeat of France, the Panhard 178 was taken into production for the German army as the ''Panzerspähwagen P204 (f)''. In German service, some of these vehicles were refitted with the 37 mm KwK 36; in 1944, a batch of captured ex-Vichy Panhards were fitted with the 50 mm KwK 38 L/42 or L/60 in an open turret.\n\nFollowing the Liberation of France in 1944, production of the Panhard 178 was reinstated for the French Army, and consideration was given to up-arming the design with the 75 mm SA 45 L/32. A larger turret was designed which could fit this gun, however, before production started the decision was taken to fit the new Panhard 178B with the pre-war 47 mm SA 35 instead. The up-armed Panhard 178B was produced for the French Army, entering service after the War: it served both in France and its colonies, such as Syria, Tahiti, Madagascar and Indo-China. The Panhard 178B was phased out of French army service in 1960; examples taken over by Syria following its independence in 1946 continued service into the mid-1960, when it was finally phased out in favour of Soviet-supplied equipment.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amd_35 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|xPq54SeNigk|'''The {{PAGENAME}} Light Tank (Well...
