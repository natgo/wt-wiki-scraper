Can go through almost all common tanks like [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]] or [[T-44]], although it will sometimes fail to do damage to tanks like [[T32E1]]\n* -18 km/h reverse speed can pull it out of a dangerous situation rather quickly\n* Smoke grenades can conceal the vehicle when needed\n* Stable hull, driving at maximum speed on flat terrain does not affect accuracy too much\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Cannon itself isn't stabilised in any way, needs significant amount of time to aim after driving over a hill or any slope (particularly with the low \"targeting\" crew skill)\n* Must be used without expert crew against elite crews of other nations, making it instantly inferior to the same tank of other nations at first\n* Armour is so poor that even German 7.92 mm can penetrate it at close range, laughably easy to destroy with HMG even over long range, especially from the side\n* HEATFS has limited post-penetration damage especially against spacious tanks like [[M60 (Family)|M60]]\n* HEATFS of AML-90 is slightly slower than general tank ammunition and thus its trajectory is quite curved, long range shots require practice\n* Wheeled design and low mass makes it extremely sluggish when turning or driving through obstacles\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
