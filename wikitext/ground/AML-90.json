In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

The crew is located in a rather small compartment, making the armoured car prompt to being knocked out by a single shot from almost any direction. It is also vulnerable to overpressure, meaning chemical energy ammunition will take out your vehicle regardless of where they impact. A kinetic energy ammunition can damage your AML through the projectile itself or the spalling generated but the inflicted damages are lesser and has a higher chance to knock out the crew members or critical modules than to destroy the vehicle. It should be noted that the thin armour has a chance to not activate fused shells like APHE, APCBC, etc, although it will trigger HEAT, HEATFS, HE and ATGM.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

The AML-90 comes with a stock OCC 60-62 HEATFS ammunition, capable of penetrating most tanks at its BR at any distance. It should be noted that the AML-90 only carries 20 rounds at max, meaning all rounds should be aimed for a kill shot as the small capacity will make the tank ammunition deplete faster than in other tanks if precautions are not taken. Commanders should always shoot to kill in the least shots necessary, know center of mass, ammunition racks, etc to successfully engage a target.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[DEFA F1 (90 mm)|90 mm DEFA F1]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

They still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAML-90 should be primarily used as a scout flanking vehicle due to its high speed, low profile, scouting capabilities and firepower (tremendous for such a small vehicle). The AML-90 has primarily 3 uses:\n\n'''Scouting:'''\n\nAs its name says, scouting. When on large maps, the scouting ability should be used at its full potential. The low profile and high speed make it able to crawl to cover fast and without creating much suspicion, while marking targets for friendlies to engage.\n\n'''Flanking:'''\n\nDue to the high speed and really powerful gun, the AML-90 can be used to hit any enemy from the back. This tactic should be a \"Hit n' Run\", you should disable or destroy targets and leave before they can engage you. The powerful gun can even be able to take on a [[Maus]] or [[E-100]] if used properly (320 mm of penetration at all ranges at 0°). Use smoke to cover your trail when you have been spotted.\n\n'''Sniping:'''\n\nDespite the optics not having a huge zoom, it is enough to be able to detect, target and engage enemy vehicles at all ranges thanks to the HEAT-FS round. Be aware of your ammo as it can only carry 20, so make all shots count. It also creates a relatively small smoke trail when firing compared to other cannons at the battle rating (105 mm, other 90 mm, 122 mm) thanks to the muzzle brake. Bushes can also be used to make this vehicle invisible due to its low profile. A big bunch of branches can cover almost 70% of the front of the AML-90, making it a moving and deadly bush. It also creates a small engine sound that will be, most of the time, masked up by other tanks, giving you a stealth capability which can be exploited in urban combat.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Its very small size makes it easy to get around and avoid shots.\n* 320 mm penetrating HEAT-FS ammo should be able to take care of any expected enemies.\n* Has access to smoke grenades and smoke shells that will allow it to move around unseen.\n* Has a roof mounted 7.62 mm that can be good to shoot planes and open-topped vehicles.\n* Armour is thin enough to not fuse some high calibre APHE shells, most notably from Soviet cannons.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Prone to overpressure damage.\n* Only has a crew of 3, a single shot will most likely knock the {{PAGENAME}} out.\n* Only 10 to 12 mm of frontal armour, can get penetrated by .50 cal HMG fire and other small-calibre weapons.\n* Very low ammo count of 20 shells.\n* Terrible brakes, it will take you 20 metres to stop.\n* Wheeled vehicle mobility: any obstacle makes you lose a lot of speed (walls, fences, potholes, hills).\n* Taking smoke shells means having to take less HEAT-FS on the already limited ammo storage.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n===Design===\nIn the 1950s, the French Army was still operating Daimler Ferrets that were becoming obsolete. For their replacement, French companies were solicited to produce a light armoured car. Panhard proposed the AML in 1957, along concurrent projects like the ELC AMX.\n\n===Development===\nThe first prototypes were tested in 1959 and the vehicles entered service in 1961. The early versions were armed with a 60 mm mortar in the turret. A new turret integrating a 90 mm cannon was developed the same year they entered service. The AML was an export success with many armies around the world adopting the AML 90, in particular African or Middle-Eastern countries with limited budgets. Almost 5,000 units were produced.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe AML 90 saw service in the French Army and in numerous armies around the world, the most renowned foreign operators being South Africa, Spain, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The AML 90 saw combat action during many conflicts throughout the years: Six-Day War, South African Border War, Iran-Iraq war, Toyota War among the most know and remains in service until today.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_aml_90 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|hcvwEs84aTs|'''The Shooting Range #194''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:30 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|zCszs4cJ0DU|'''My Best Scout Game Ever - {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''PhlyDaily''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[AUBL/74]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Panhard_AML|[Wikipedia] Panhard AML]]\n* [https://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/France/Panhard_AML.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Panhard AML]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Panhard}}\n{{France light tanks}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
