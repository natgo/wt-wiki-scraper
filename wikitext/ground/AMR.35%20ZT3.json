In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Recon Machinegun-car AMR 35 ZT3) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. Featuring a quick firing \"stabilized\" 25 mm gun, good mobility and bulletproof armour, it differs greatly from other rank 1 French tanks while offering similar gameplay to the Soviet [[ASU-57]]. It is arguably the best first French tank to research.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nWith only 13 mm all-around, this is not a frontline tank and it should fear artillery barrages, bombs and strafing aircraft. Distance is your main defense since most rank 1 guns are inaccurate, often missing such a small target. Any penetrating shot from another tank can easily disable this tank.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, superstructure)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (cupola)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its good ballistic properties (flat trajectory) makes it easy to aim at usual combat ranges (~500 m). This gun comes with an enjoyable feature: it has a LOCK, which is a primitive form of stabilizer. It enables this tank to reliably shoot on the move in middle to far range (100 to 500 m). Or else, one can stop and shoot faster than other rank 1 tanks. The MAC 31 is a decent coaxial MG. The main downside this gun platform has is its limited gun traverse, which makes close-range engagements very hard.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Mle1934 TP (Ch.F) || APC || 71 || 68 || 56 || 44 || 34 || 27\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Mle1934 TP (Ch.F) || APC || 950 || 0.31 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.1.0.94''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThis is a good introduction to a typical tank destroyer's gameplay: a good gun on a fragile chassis and even more. With its low silhouette, the AMR can completely hide itself behind a wide variety of terrain features: wrecked tanks hulls, shallow hills, rocks, brick walls... Staying away from the fight and sniping for unsuspecting enemies. When spotted, choosing to reverse back into cover is a good decision.\n\n'''Classical TD:'''\n\nHiding behind terrain and obstacles, using its good gun depression while staying at some distance from the target is the best way to use this TD in most situations. Applies well on any non-urban terrain.\n\n'''Sneaking TD'''\n\nThis is a very situational way to play the AMR, mostly efficient in RB and SB games but still applicable to AB matches. This tactics relies on this tank's low silhouette: it can easily hide behind almost anything. Use this tactic to sneak onto an enemy's back or to lure the enemy team into a trap (needs a complying ally). Being a ninja AMR applies well to urban combat.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

Despite being larger and heavier, its bigger engine and improved suspension made it faster and more manoeuvrable than its predecessor. 167 of these light tanks, many armed with 13.2 mm machine guns in a standard turret, were in service during the Battle for France in 1940. A subvariant, the ZT3, was planned to carry the French standard anti-tank gun, the 25 mm, to serve alongside the machine-gun armed AMR.35s in the French light motorized units. A total of ten ZT3 are believed to have been produced and issued prior to the fall of France.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amr_35_zt3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|nVCobV8eS5A|'''{{PAGENAME}}, French, Tier-1, Tank Destroyer''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|1URDdCKMNOY|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[L3/33 CC]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[Wikipedia:AMR_35#ZT_3|[Wikipedia<nowiki>]</nowiki> AMR 35 ZT 3]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/france/Renault_AMR-35.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Renault AMR-35]\n\n{{France tank destroyers}}"}}
