In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. It is the first of many iterations of the famous AMX-13. Although this version lacks the punch of its successors, it certainly offers a good foresight of what this light chassis can do.\n\nThe AMX-13 (FL11) is the first tank with the distinctive oscillating French turret design, combining it with a low, sleek-profiled chassis - almost identical to the AMX-13, save for a few small details (e.g. exhaust). The FL11 has a smaller, shorter gun with a double muzzle break, on a smaller turret that doesn't have the large rear counter-weight/storage and the canvas over the turret joint found on later models.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThis light tank actually has decent armour at its battle rating, especially in the turret front area where 40 mm sloped at ~60° will defeat some small calibre guns. However, although the turret's front armour is good, this does not mean you can just go hull down and be safe, it will only provide you a chance to survive a shot and reposition (a useful tactic to learn when playing the AMX-13). Everywhere else has only 20 mm of flat armour. The upper front plate is sloped at 66°, which may ricochet long-range shots. With only 10 mm of roof armour, stay away from low-flying aircraft as your own armament does not enable you to engage aerial threats.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof - rear, cupola roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (turret base, turret, gun mantlet, cupola)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=418|rbMinHp=239}}\n\nWith a power ratio of 26.97 HP/ton in AB, or 15.42 HP/ton in RB ('''stock!'''), the {{PAGENAME}} chassis offers mobility that leave almost nothing to be desired (reverse speed is kind of slow with only -6 km/h). With its wide tracks, even soft terrain is not that hard to cross. The only thing to consider while driving this light tank is obstacles as they can significantly reduce your speed, thus making you vulnerable and/or less effective. One could make very good use of such a fast and small vehicle by avoiding contact while making a large flanking manoeuvre, scouting enemies and popping out sometimes to take down enemies from unexpected angles.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|SA49 (75 mm)}}\n\nThe 75 mm SA49 cannon is quite decent at the BR. Its only flaw being a bad firing arc (shell drops fast with distance), which makes long-range engagements inadvisable. Penetration rates are comparable to those of the Russian [[F-34 (76 mm)|F-34]] cannon or those of the British [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder Mk.V (57 mm)|QF 6-pounder]]'s stock shot. While not being the best gun at the BR, it certainly provides enough firepower to destroy any enemy's flank. Horizontal drive is fast, allowing for fast reaction shots in close range engagements. As for elevation angles, -6° of depression feels a bit lacking while 13° of elevation is clearly the worst thing about this configuration: you cannot engage air targets. One last thing to consider about your main gun: it is mounted on an oscillating turret, which makes stop-and-shoot tactics ineffective. Coaxial armament is the classic French MAC 31 with 100 rounds loaded and ready to turn those soft targets to shreds. A sweet addition to this tank is 4 smoke launchers located on the lower turret part's back, these can be used either to shield you and your allies from incoming fire, to cover your retreat or to hide your team's movements from enemy sight. Smoke launchers at this low BR prepares players to higher-ranking battlefields and tactic opportunities, make sure to master them.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[SA49 (75 mm)|75 mm SA49]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe AMX-13 (FL11), in line with most light tanks, shines best as a flanker and scout, due to its almost non-existent armour. Some shots against lower tiers can be bounced off by the sloped upper glacis plate and turret front, but anywhere else will get penetrated with ease. A sub-par gun without APHE ammunition means frontal engagements are mostly out of the question.\n\nScout and flank, as any other light tank should. The AMX-13 (FL11) cannot stand up to direct assaults from the enemy; it has irrelevant armour, decent speed, a useable gun with lacking depression (especially facing forward), and only 3 crew. The bad reverse speed also makes it unable to retreat behind cover once discovered, so caution in engagements is advised. It is also worth noting that the low velocity and high drop rate of its shells allow the FL11 to engage from behind slopes without having to reveal itself.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The French Army was facing a better and better armed enemy and their cavalry units were still equipped with WW2 tanks like the M24 or the M5A1. The French government decided to send the latest developed French tank, the AMX-13, in Indochina. However, the AMX-13 needed to undergo modifications for the South-Eastern theater. The large FL-10 autoloader turret and the long 75 mm gun made the AMX-13 unadapted for the logistical constraints of the colonial conflict (limited air transport capabilities and combat in constricted urban environments).\n\nThat's why a new turret was installed (the FL-11 equipping the Panhard EBR reconnaissance armoured car) which was smaller, lighter and sporting a shorter 75 mm gun. The new turret made the tank less tall and shorter in overall length. However, the new turret was cramped, which was detrimental to the manual reloading of the gun. No major modification was brought to the hull: the only noticeable difference was the shift from 4 track return rollers to 2.\n\nThe production started in 1954 with an order for 20 units but only 5 were produced. By that time, the First Indochina War had come to an end and the need for such an urban combat vehicle had disappeared.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe 5 {{PAGENAME}} were allocated to the 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment in Oujda, Morocco. They never saw combat action and were sold in 1956 to the Moroccan Army following the country's independence. The light tanks stayed in the Moroccan arsenal until 1973. It is unclear if they ever saw combat under Moroccan flag.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_13_fl_11 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|G-sMfeWsEq0|'''The Shooting Range #148''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 03:38 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|bADMYdZae2A|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|uhgodizubC4|'''The Shooting Range #77''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:19 discusses the AMX-13.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[AMX-13 (Family)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[M24 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:AMX-13|[Wikipedia] AMX-13]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar-france-amx-13-avec-tourelle-fl-11/ <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> AMX-13 Avec Tourelle FL-11]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AMX}}\n{{France light tanks}}"}}
