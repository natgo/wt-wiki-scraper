It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]].\n\nAt its current battle rating, the AMX-13 (HOT) can definitely do some serious damage, even to top-rank MBTs and (as of 1.81) helicopters too. The six HOT ATGMs are enough to penetrate almost any conventional armour on direct hit, and may even penetrate the [[T-64B]]'s upper glacis with ERA in place if hit it directly, though strong NERA screen might be too much for it. All six missiles can be fired in short succession, although only the one fired last can be controlled.\n\nThis makes it a viable tank destroyer, but, unlike any of the MBTs, it cannot take a hit and survive. Even certain machine guns and aircraft cannons are capable of destroying it easily. Use its spotting ability to alert your team to enemies, and try to guide ATGM into a critical spot, like crew or ammo, since ATGM can overpenetrate.\n\nJust remember: AMX-13s only have six ATGMs, after that, it is using a conventional gun, firing solid shot AP, which technically can ammo rack tanks like T-64 and T-80 from the side, but it's not a guaranteed kill.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

This particular modification should be used always as a support vehicle. The commander should always keep this in mind:\n\n* ATGM: frontal engagements at 100 m (the ATGM has to fly up a couple of metres to be able to follow the crosshair due to the launcher placement). Distance engagements past 200-300 m.\n\n* 75 mm gun: Side shots at distances between 0-200 m\n\nIt should be noted that the AMX-13 HOT can face [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1s]], meaning the main gun is capable of destroying the tank from all sides. Enemy targets like [[T-54/55 (Family)|T-54/55]] will only be able to be penetrated frontally with the ATGM and from the sides with the 75 mm gun. The [[T-55AM-1]] can be one of the toughest enemies it will face as the ATGM will not be able to penetrate the turret mantlet when seen directly from the front, aim for centre-mass with the ATGM.\n\nDo not stay alone with this tank unless you are being a scout vehicle (as it has that capacity).\n\n'''When in urban combat:'''\n\nThe AMX-13 should be played as a flanker or as a \"medic\" vehicle thanks to being able to repair friendlies due to being a light tank. It should be noted that the ATGM use is reduced considerably when in urban combat due to the way the launchers are placed. Use your mobility, scouting capabilities and autoloader to mark, disable and support allies in killing enemy vehicles. When facing Russian tanks, always try to get side shots. When facing NATO tanks (excluding heavy tanks and WW2 tanks), side shots might not be required depending on the armour the AMX-13 is facing.\n\n'''When in rural combat:'''\n\nThe AMX-13 should be played as a scout or as an ATGM sniper. Be aware of your zoom sights as the AMX-13 lacks potent zoom. Use ATGMs when engaging far targets as your main gun will lose penetration at ranges longer than 300 m, reducing spalling or not penetrating enemy armour at all. Use your scout ability to mark targets for teammates and let them engage them. Using your speed, you are able to flank the enemy as you are able to cross the map side to side with relative ease and speed.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It was designed at Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX). A long line of prototypes lead to the production model. The first prototype was the AMX-13 2A in 1948, with four road wheels. Next came the 2B with five road wheels and a raised idler wheel, and the 2C with the FL-10 turret and two return rollers. The 2D introduced an arrangement with four return rollers.\n\n'''Design'''\n\nThe turret held the commander and gunner, and was set to the rear of the vehicle. The hull was very compact and low profile, with the engine on the right side and the driver in the front, left side.\n\nThe main feature of the AMX-13 was the FL-10 oscillating turret, armed with a 75 mm gun with an automatic loader system fed by two six-round magazines, for a total of 12 rounds in the autoloading mechanism. The gun could depress 8° and elevate 12°, with 5° per second of elevation speed. The turret could rotate 360° with 30° per second of traverse speed. A TCV 107 laser rangefinder was provided to the gunner. 6 smoke grenade launchers were fitted on the turret, with 6 more grenades stored in the vehicle. One coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun was fitted, with 1,800 rounds in belts of 200. Another 7.62 mm machine gun could be fitted on an anti-aircraft mount with 1,800 rounds.\n\nThe gasoline engine produced 250 horsepower, and the manual transmission had five forward and one reverse gear. The suspension was of the torsion bar type. The drive sprockets were in the front, return rollers in the back, and there were five road wheels and four return rollers. The AMX-13 could reach a speed of 60 km/h, and it had a range of 400 km.\n\nThe protection of the AMX-13, it being a light tank, was not great. It could withstand heavy machine gun and low-calibre autocannon rounds from the front, but the sides could not even withstand heavy machine gun fire. An appliqué armour package was developed to increase protection at the choice of the user.\n\n'''Production'''\n\nProduction began in 1952, at Atelier de Construction Roanne (ARE). Over 7,000 AMX-13s of all variants were produced, seeing export to a number of nations as well as seeing service with the French Army. Production shifted to Creusot-Loire at Chalon-sur-Saône in 1964, since ARE began producing the AMX-30 in that year.\n\n'''Service'''\n\nThe French Army received most of the original 75 mm-armed version, with about 3,000 entering service. They were assigned to the regular armoured units, which were mostly filled with M47 and M48 Patton medium tanks at the time. AMX-13 squadrons had four tanks, and were split into two sections of one infantry section and one light tank section each, along with an ammunition truck and command vehicle. These squadrons were used for screening and reconnaissance, locating enemy forces and engaging them. After the first section had engaged the enemy and was reloading, the second section engaged the enemy. The process of alternating reloading and firing between the sections allowed the tanks to hold off the enemy until medium tanks arrived.\n\nIn the 1960's, the AMX-30 entered service. AMX-13s were used during the decolonization war in Algeria (1954-1962), although they saw little combat due to the lack of opposition and the terrain. After the French AMX-13s were up-gunned with the 90 mm gun, they often saw service in foreign theaters of operation due to their relative inexpensiveness. The AMX-13s were decommissioned and put into reserve starting in 1985.\n\n'''HOT variant'''\n\nThe AMX-13 HOT was a prototype made by AMX featuring HOT launchers and ATGM as an intent to upgrade the AMX-13 SS.11\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_13_hot Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|G-sMfeWsEq0|'''The Shooting Range #148''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 04:54 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|r4d1v8Qm-Mc|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|uhgodizubC4|'''The Shooting Range #77''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:19 discusses the AMX-13.|MmHV4ddBtik|'''{{PAGENAME}} - Not Good For BR 9.0''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same missile\n* [[RakJPz 2 (HOT)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:AMX-13|[Wikipedia] AMX-13]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/France/AMX-13.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> AMX-13]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AMX}}\n{{France light tanks}}\n[[Category:ATGM vehicles]]"}}
