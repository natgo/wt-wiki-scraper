In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.''-->\nThe '''{{specs|name}}''' ('''''A'''telier de Construction d'Issy-les-'''M'''oulineau'''x''', char de '''13''' t, '''d'''éfense '''c'''ontre '''a'''vions, canon de '''40''' mm'': Issy-les-Moulineaux construction bureau, 13 ton tank, anti-air defense, 40 mm gun) is a Rank {{specs|rank}} French self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating|1}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. It is a clear improvement to its predecessor in all domains, combining two good things to make them even better: the [[AMX-13]]'s chassis and an improved [[Bofors (40 mm)|Bofors]] cannon (The 40 mm Mle 51 T1 cannon is a French version of the usual 40mm Bofors AA gun).\n\nAn [[AMX-13]] chassis, a classic of French post-war technology has been modified to fit SPAA role. This specific chassis has some variants over the usual ones : an enlarged turret ring and with it some extra storage boxes, both extend sideways over the tracks. This tank is quite recognizable for its large box-shaped turret over its chassis.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!--''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?''\n\n''If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.''-->\nThis tank has 20 mm of armour, all around, barely angled but for the UFP, this won't protect it from antitank rounds nor from autocannon fire but it can certainly deflect poorly-aimed HMG bursts, but not for too long. If taking too long bursts (or if the enemy gets too close), some bullets may find their way through the two ''large holes'' in the turret front, near the gun area (there is also two smaller holes in the turret's back). In sum, this tank's armour is not to be trusted, but it will save you from stray bullets and medium to long range MG/HMG fire.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !!

With its turret being a little bit heavier and its engine 31 hp less powerful, this tank is slower than the usual [[AMX-13]]. It can still carry its user wherever it wants, as long as the situation does not require fast escape maneuvers: with only -6 km/h backwards, it is difficult to quickly get out of an unwanted situation.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Being twice as fast-firing as its predecessor makes it easier to get planes down, but you will still have to aim. As for engaging tanks, with up to 94 mm max penetration, you will start to struggle firing at most enemies since their frontal armour is strong enough to block incoming 40 mm rounds, though with some precision, medium tanks and even heavy tanks can fall victim to your gun. Lightly armoured tanks and SPAAs are easy targets with your 4-rounds bursts.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\n\n* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - The standard belt can fulfill both roles (anti-air and lightly armoured vehicles) but with a lower rate of fire.\n* '''40mm HE-T:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}} - This belt is adapted for targeting aircraft with its high-explosive shells.\n* '''40mm AP-T:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - This belt is adapted for targeting lightly armoured vehicles with its armour-piercing rounds.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Belt\n! colspan=\"6\" | '''Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)'''\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Default || 94 || 90 || 77 || 62 || 51 || 41\n|-\n| 40mm HE-T || 94 || 90 || 77 || 62 || 51 || 41\n|-\n| 40mm AP-T || 94 || 90 || 77 || 62 || 51 || 41\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n<!-- '''Last updated: 1.101.1.33''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It has an auto-cannon that does not fires fast enough to engage planes efficiently nor does it penetrates enough to shred tanks. As it is, this SPAA is good for front line use: providing cover for incoming ground attackers to its allies while also securing flanks from fast-movers.\n\nGood at engaging both tanks and planes, its versatile belts allows this vehicle to switch roles in a split second. In the right hands, in a downtier, this SPAA is an absolute monster, easily capable of ace matches against tanks.\n\n'''SPAA use:'''\n\nPre-aim your gun in the predicted direction of your target: the DCA-40 has a bit of a slow turret traverse for an SPAA. It is easier to aim at targets coming towards you: stay with your team and fire when the plane is ~500 m away: an hitting round will shred it in no time. Any other SPAA tactics apply normally to this vehicle.\n\n'''Front-line use:'''\n\n''Do not'' engage tanks frontally: prefer lateral engagements, surprise your foes. If it happens that the enemy team is composed of medium/light tanks, there is a great chance that you can knock some of them out, but be sure to have an escape route as any tank noticing you counters those flanking maneuvers. Heavy tanks at this BR are usually very hard to get trough, even from the side, engage at your own risk.\n\nEven though your gun has SPAA - Level Penetration, It can go through pretty much any tank side that it faces. '''Even the Tiger II.''' And it's from this that the DCA 40 gets it's charm tactic:\n\n# Take out the gun\n# Take out the track\n# Take out the machine gun\n# Take out the tank\n\nKnowing this, you can win battles against Panthers, Tigers (I and II), and many tanks you might find in an uptier at medium range, even when taking this tank into a higher tier than it could face.\n\nTaking out the gun is fairly easy, your center mounted bofors just needs to be aimed at the gun, and can take it out with 2 or 3 shots.\n\nOnce you've taken out the gun, go for the track or transmission. doing this will render any tank immobile for at least 20 seconds, which is more than enough.\n\n'''93mm of penetration can go through almost any tank's side armour and rear armour in the game.''' With the exception of the Maus, of course, your gun can '''Shred''' enemy tanks from the side. Knowing this\n\nIt's worth mentioning that in a downtier against axis powers, you can penetrate every vehicle you see ''from the front'' except for some German casemates. In an uptier, if you must engage a heavily armored tank from the front, several well placed shots to the cannon barrel will knock it out, and enable you to flank at your leisure and feast on their side armor. A more conservative way to play is to stay a few meters behind the front-line and spot flanking tanks while also watching the skies.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!--''Summarize and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Several projects were launched using Bofors guns. Among them was the AMX-13 DCA canon de 40 mm using the hull of the AMX-13 on which was installed a specially designed SAMM S 980 turret housing the 40 mm Bofors L/70 gun. The turret offered good protection for the crew, 360° traverse and a 90° elevation angle. The Mle51 T1 gun fired 240 rounds per minute at 993 m/s.\n\n===Development===\nThe development of the SAMM S 980 turret was stopped in 1957 and the Bofors gun production stopped in 1958. The experience gathered from similar single-gun SPAAG projects put the stress on numerous shortcomings when compared to twin-gun designs.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe {{PAGENAME}} never saw service or combat action in the French Army.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_13_dca_40 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|PosWOnOGkSo|'''Best experimental vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 7:28 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|ocKGyaYTPds|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[AMX-13 (Family)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Ostwind]]\n* [[ZSU-37]]\n* [[Crusader AA Mk I]]\n* [[Lvkv 42]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5269-vehicle-amx-13-dca-40-anti-air-tank-en|[Vehicle] {{PAGENAME}}: Anti-Air Tank]]\n* [[wikipedia:AMX-13|[Wikipedia] AMX-13]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/France/AMX-13-DCA.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> AMX-13 DCA]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AMX}}\n{{France anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
