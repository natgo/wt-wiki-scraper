In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.93 \"Shark Attack\"]].\n\nIn the 1960s, a proposal was made to mount a 142 mm gun system firing the ACRA (Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé), English: Anti-Tank Rapid Self-guided Missile. A single prototype was finished in 1967 with a unique cast turret built around the gun, but due to the unreasonably high cost of the missiles, the project was scrapped. However, in War Thunder, it is a formidable tank to play with play styles similar to the [[M60A2]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n\nThe AMX-30 ACRA mount as we saw before a 142mm laser guided gun, capable of launching ACRA missile and High Explosive round. It can carry 36 rounds, 16 in the turret and 20 in the hull, next to the driver, so you have the possibility to get a higher survivability from hull shots by removing these 20 rounds. The gun reload is 15.6 seconds with a level 1 crew and can be upgraded to 12 seconds with a max crew.\n\nThe ACRA missile is pretty fast, making the tank very useful on large maps and sits at a battle rating where nothing will be able to resist the missile. Be careful when shooting at the sides of enemy tanks, the missiles function like a HEAT round and tends to be absorbed by the tracks if hit directly. Also like a HEAT round, don't try to shoot missiles through walls, fences, big bushes, or trees.\n\nAnother good point with the gun is that you don't need to stop the tank to fire. However, the missile is guided with a laser mounted with the gun, which is not stabilized. This means your missiles will bounce up and down as you guide them if you are moving. This also means you cannot fire over obstacles like you can with wire guided missiles, as the laser needs constant line-of-sight to the back of the missile.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[ACRA (142 mm)|142 mm ACRA]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Similar to the American M551 Sheridan, the prototypes were fitted with a 142 mm cannon to fire the prototype missile \"Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé\" (Self-Propelled Rapid Anti-Tank Missile), or ACRA in short.  The vehicle was also fitted with an enlarged turret capable of fitting larger-calibre cannons of 120 mm. The prototypes were cancelled in 1972 due to rising development costs for the ACRA missile, which was later replaced by the HOT ATGM.\n\nThe AMX-30 was a highly successful French main battle tank (MBT) of the 1960s and 1970s with over 3,000 vehicles built in total. The AMX-30 family served as the main French MBT until the introduction of the Leclerc MBT in the 1990s; as well, a myriad of variants were created including anti-tank and anti-aircraft versions (such as the AMX-30R Roland missile battery). One of the most unique anti-tank variants was the AMX-30 ACRA, centred around the ACRA ATGM.\n\nThe ACRA, or Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé (Self-Propelled Rapid Anti-Tank Missile) was a prototype French anti-tank missile system designed to destroy enemy tanks. The missile was fired from a 142 mm smoothbore gun and accelerated to a speed of over 2520 km/h during flight. The weapon could be fitted with a 2 kg shaped charge warhead or a similar high-explosive warhead for use against personnel.\n\nAn AMX-30 was specially modified with an enlarged turret to fire the ACRA missile, along with a 142 mm smoothbore cannon that could also fire HE ammunition. The vehicle's enlarged turret could've also accommodated larger cannons such as a 120 mm cannon. Despite this, the weapon system had key limitations - primarily, the cost of the ACRA missile had skyrocketed to over 1 million francs per shot. As well, the missile could not be fired from helicopters, further limiting its effectiveness in battle. As a result, the ACRA missile system was cancelled in 1972, marking the demise of the AMX-30 ACRA. The role of the ACRA missile system would be fulfilled by the HOT, a more versatile ATGM fired from both ground vehicles and helicopters.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_30_ACRA Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|wJkQW4kSJjM|'''French MBTs''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:54 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other comparable gun/launcher tanks:\n\n* [[M551]]\n* [[M60A2]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6455-development-amx-30-acra-luxury-à-la-française-en|[Devblog] AMX-30 ACRA: Luxury à la Française]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AMX}}\n{{France medium tanks}}\n[[Category:ATGM vehicles]]"}}
