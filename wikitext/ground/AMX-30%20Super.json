In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 \"Imperial Navy\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The turret is not great as most shells will penetrate it, often killing the gunner and detonating the ammunition in the rear of the turret. Unlike the Leopard I, the {{PAGENAME}} is capable of carrying enough ammunition in the turret to fight, leaving the hull relatively safe, but this comes with a price: whenever the tank is hit in the turret, there's a high chance that the ammunition will catch fire.\n\nThe fuel tank in the hull can stop some heat shells, but it's not something to rely on. Given the high mobility of the tank and the two-plane stabilizer, the vehicle gives his best when moving fast and hitting the enemy from the distance.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,317|rbMinHp=752}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is fast and nimble. Its engine gives a specific power of 1,622 hp in AB and 850 hp in RB/SB. With a power-to-ton ratio of 23.2 hp/ton in RB/SB and 44.4 hp/ton in AB, this tank can certainly traverse the terrains smoothly. Being about 36.5 tons, this tank is relatively lighter than its competitors of similar BR. This tank can go up to 72 km/h in AB and 65 km/h in RB/SB forwards and it goes up to -30 km/h in AB and -27 km/h in RB/SB reverse.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|CN-105-F1 (105 mm)}}\n\nThe main armament of the {{PAGENAME}} is the 105 mm CN-105-F1 cannon, which is very similar to the likes of the [[L7A3 (105 mm)|105 mm L7A3]].  The gun takes about 6.7 seconds to reload with an aced crew with max leadership and weapon reloading skill which is fairly standard among its competitors.  This cannon fires APFSDS, HEAT, smoke and HE. It is recommended to at most keep 23 shells in the tank when playing Realistic Battles as its ready rack can carry 22 shells and this effectively removes all of the ammunition rack in the hull behind the fuel tanks (except 4 shells around the turret ring). It is recommended to take a loadout of mostly APFSDS with a few HEAT and Smoke shells just in case.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[CN-105-F1 (105 mm)|105 mm CN-105-F1]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The OCC 105 F1 HEATFS may be very useful against light targets such as SPAAG or light tanks. The OFPH 105 F1 smoke shell provides extra ranged covering smoke in order to mask you or your team (possibly even blinding the enemy) in combat.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| OCC 105 F1 || HEAT || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400\n|-\n| OE 105 F1 Mle.60 || HE || 25 || 25 || 25 || 25 || 25 || 25\n|-\n| OFL 105 F1 || APFSDS || 361 || 358 || 350 || 341 || 332 || 322\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| OCC 105 F1 || HEAT || 1,000 || 10.95 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 1,020 || 62° || 69° || 73°\n|-\n| OE 105 F1 Mle.60 || HE || 700 || 12.1 || 0 || 0.1 || 2,000 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| OFL 105 F1 || APFSDS || 1,525 || 3.8 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Smoke shell characteristics\n|-\n!

A number of improvements were made to the French tank in order to enhance its firepower, increase its dynamic characteristics, and (optionally) enhance its armour to a certain extent.\n\nThe tank's firing potential was improved thanks to the installation of a MOLF fire control system with a stabilized sight and a stabilizer for the main gun. The tank's mobility was enhanced with a new 850-horsepower diesel engine, a German automatic transmission, and new torsion bars and hydraulic shock absorbers. The new tank was demonstrated to the public under the name \"Super AMX-30\" during testing in Saudi Arabia, but no buyers were found for the upgraded French tank, and only one Super AMX-30 was ever made.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6198-development-super-amx-30-the-stabilizer-is-ready-to-go-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_30_super Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|wJkQW4kSJjM|'''French MBTs''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:21 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|4p41pBTwDEw|'''Premium Vehicles: {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''War Thunder Wiki''|PG8G07cq0iY|'''The Shooting Range #153''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|Z5w_0_bYYrM|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[AMX-30 (Family)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Leopard A1A1]]\n* [[Type 74]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6198-development-super-amx-30-the-stabilizer-is-ready-to-go-en|[Devblog] Super AMX-30: The Stabilizer Is Ready to Go!]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AMX}}\n{{France medium tanks}}\n{{France premium ground vehicles}}"}}
