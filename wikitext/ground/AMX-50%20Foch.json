In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]] along with the initial French ground tree.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe AMX-50 Foch is able to withstand every single round it faces in combat except HEATFS and 105 mm APCR sub-calibre shots frontally. It is often confused with the [[CA Lorraine]] and vice-versa due to its similarities in profile, size and frontal plate. For the same reason, people may think you are fragile yet you are one of the toughest armour to crack at the battle rating. Only the front is the strong section of the tank. Roof, rear and sides are the most vulnerable places of the tank, even for 20 mm autocannons.\n\nRegarding crew compartment, despite being not too tight but not huge either, it has a high survivability specially for the number of crew members and the huge breech of the 120 mm cannon (they will most likely destroy your breech with a side shot but it will stop most of the spalling). The ammunition is located at the rear of the crew compartment (in front of engine deck) an at the hull sides. This makes the Foch one of the easiest tanks to ammo rack at the battle rating. The tank has a crew amount of 5 crewmen: driver, gunner, commander and two loaders, one of them is the machine gunner\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,420|rbMinHp=884}}\n\nThe AMX-50 Foch is not as fast as compared with other turretless tank destroyers as the [[JPz 4-5]] but not as slow as the [[Jagdtiger]]. Despite being huge, it is absurdly fast and agile for a tank its size due to being mounted on an AMX-50 chassis but with stronger armour than the Jagdtiger. As the rest of the French tanks, it has excellent neutral steering but the reverse speed is horrible. It is compensated with a tremendous horsepower and armour as well as a potent main gun. It should not be played as fast as the JPz 4-5 as well as risky but it should not be fully played as bastion defence.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The gun has a use and ballistic similar to the Surbaisse (both share the same ammunition).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[SA46 (120 mm)|120 mm SA46]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Despite having a \"low\" penetration (compared to other rounds seen at the battle rating) it should not be underestimated. It has the penetration to deal with all heavy tanks frontally (with exception of Maus and E-100) as well as enough spalling to destroy lightly armoured vehicles. This round is a 90% confirmed knock-out with a single shot due to its tremendous mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| 120 mm Obus de rupture || APBC || 301 || 298 || 286 || 272 || 258 || 245\n|-\n| 120 mm Obus explosif || HE || 39 || 39 || 39 || 39 || 39 || 39\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| 120 mm Obus de rupture || APBC || 1,067 || 23.1 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| 120 mm Obus explosif || HE || 762 || 22.84 || 0 || 0.1 || 4,650 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated:''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->\n{{main|MG 151 (15 mm)}}\n\nThe MG151 can be considered as one of the most reliable HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) in game due to multiple factors: ammunition capacity, muzzle velocity and penetration, stopping power and rate of fire. It is a Jack-of-all-trades when it comes to ground battles, it has a faster muzzle velocity than 20 mm cannons but has more destructive power than the 14.5 mm (Russian HMG calibre) machine gun but it overheats really fast. The MG151 is almost exclusive to this specific tank and is able of doing multiple things:\n\n* Immediate ground defence: this machine gun is able to damage and destroyed external components of all tanks (tracks, gun barrels, etc), destroy lightly armoured vehicles (with armour thinner than 45 mm), obstruction removal (fences, walls, etc) and spotting.\n* Immediate air defence: due to being roof mounted inside a cupola with a 360° rotation and a 20° elevation, it is able to critically damage low-flying aircraft. This belt has AP-I round which can cause fatal damage on all low flying aircraft (it often lights them on fire or damages their engine).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[MG 151 (15 mm)|15 mm MG 151]]\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe AMX-50 Foch does well in concealment, and so the first thing to do upon spawning onto the battlefield is to find a place where the {{PAGENAME}} can hide while having a good arc of fire against incoming enemies. Do this to minimise the weak points of the vehicle, such as the weak side armour and the long reload time. If the enemy sees only the front armour, it should be fine given the thick, sloped armour available, but do take note on the type of enemy encountered.\n\nIf a Leopard I tank or anything else with HEAT shells notice the {{PAGENAME}}'s position, immediately move as these vehicles can very easily penetrate the {{PAGENAME}}'s frontal armour. However, encountering tanks with only standard AP shells like a Tiger II should suffice as they would have a harder time penetrating through the front of the {{PAGENAME}}.\n\nBeing patient is key to the success of the {{PAGENAME}}. Going out and hunting enemies, especially in close-range fights, is not beneficial to a long-term survival strategy in the {{PAGENAME}}, especially with the weak side armour.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

Due to the delays and problems encountered during construction, only five prototypes were constructed and only one was finished which became known as the Canon Automoteur AMX-50 Foch, named after the supreme allied commander during World War I, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, general and military theorist. The main purpose of the AMX-50 \"120 mm\" was to provide long-range support for the medium AMX-50 \"100 mm\" tanks. An ambitious task of designing a version with a 155 mm cannon was started, however, this never made it past the drawing stage.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_50_foch Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|b6qqrQqgUZw|'''The Shooting Range #99''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:38 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|B2woWvJK4ew|'''Top 7 most armoured vehicles'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:12  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|xF4-TcnyWw0|'''Best tank destroyers''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 6:08 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Object 268]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5292-vehicle-amx-50-foch-racing-tortoise-en|[Vehicle] AMX-50 Foch: Racing Tortoise]]\n* [[Wikipedia:AMX-50#AMX_50_%22120_mm%22|[Wikipedia] AMX 50 \"120 mm\"]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AMX}}\n{{France tank destroyers}}"}}
