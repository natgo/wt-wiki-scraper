In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 \"Imperial Navy\"]] as a reward for the World War [[Season 1: Recon under fire]].\n\nAs a member of the French AMX-50 family of tanks, it is very similar to the [[AMX-50 Surbaisse|AMX-50 Surbaissé]]. Compared to the Surbaissé, it is lower, has a better protected turret, and a 20 mm MG 151 cannon on top, which is very efficient against aircraft and lightly armoured vehicles. It is also heavier and doesn't have smoke grenade launchers compared to the Surbaissé.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== Start of the project ===\nIn July 1945, in the aftermath of liberation, the general staff of the French armed forces expressed the need for a heavy tank of national design. In view of the rise of tensions with the USSR and with the balance sheets drawn from the last world conflict, the French Army presented a precise specification of what was to be the future main tank of the army. The tank was to be comparable on several points to already existing machines. Indeed, it was requested armament of a minimum power equivalent to the gun of 88 mm German Tiger II. It was also asked for a shield equivalent to that of the Panther and mobility close to that of the T-34.\n\n=== The AMX-50 ''Surblindé'' ===\nIn 1955, an AMX 50 ''Surblindé'' (over-armoured) is produced, able to measure itself against the most powerful machines then in service. A variant of the [[AMX-50 Surbaissé|AMX-50 ''Surbaissé'']] with a reinforced armour, the front armour shape is inspired by Russian tanks IS-3 or T10. The weight of this prototype reached about 60 tons.\n\n=== Abandonment of the project ===\nThe tests carried out indicated a tank superior to its American and Soviet counterparts that were M26 Pershing and IS-3 respectively. But the Americans did not want to finance a project that would not be adopted. It was, therefore, necessary that the two countries, France and West Germany, adopt the tank so that its development continues. If France seemed ready to accept the project, it was not the case of West Germany which was inspired by the doctrines of the former general Heinz Guderian, a supporter of lighter and faster tanks. In addition, the development of new technologies and capabilities in the field of missiles and hollow-shell shells would render the massive tank armour obsolete and unsuitable for future large-scale conflict.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_50_surblinde Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[AMX-50 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6186-development-amx-50-surblind%C3%A9-french-powerlifter-en|[Devblog] AMX-50 Surblindé: French Powerlifter]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AMX}}\n{{France heavy tanks}}"}}
