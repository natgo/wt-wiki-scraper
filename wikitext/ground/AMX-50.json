In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. It features the same armament and turret as the [[Lorraine 40t]] on a more robust chassis, similar to that of the [[AMX M4]], in sum, it is a fusion of the former's firepower and the latter's mobility and protection. It is the logical next step to the French rank IV medium tech tree.\n\nThe lower part resembles that of a [[Panther D|Panther]]'s hull with its overlapping metal road wheels, its two large fans over the engine deck, its sloped front and back armour and its high profile. There are a few things that distinguishes it from its predecessor: there is not longer a \"flat\" portion between the LFP and UFP and the two fan casings have been removed. As for the turret, it is quite a classical post-war French design: an oscillating turret fitted with an autoloader mechanism, a long gun and turret bulge and a thick turret ring.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Suspension wheels are interleaved and thus overlap in some areas.\n* Add-on tracks hang on the hull sides in the crew compartment area.\n* Hull undersides above tracks are 20 mm thick.\n* Belly armour is 20 mm thick.\n* There is a 20 mm plate separating the crew compartment from the engine bay at the top of the hull.\n* There is a 5 mm plate separating the crew compartment from the engine bay at the bottom of the hull.\n* Overlapping wheels provide extra 20 mm to the hull's lower side.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}}'s hull is very similar to that of the famous German medium tank, even in armour values. It is only slightly weak from the side, making angling quite ineffective. This armour should be able to deflect incoming shots from the weaker tanks it may encounter at its BR spread, notably the famous Soviet [[D-5T (85 mm)|85 mm D-5T]]. With its good slope, it can easily deflect APCR shots. The only negative point is the turret: it is very weak to incoming shots: with only 45 mm sloped at 52°, it is weaker than a [[T-34-85 (D-5T)]]'s hull. The turret armour is a noticeable downgrade from the [[AMX M4]], so you will need to be more careful about taking hits. The only way to avoid being taken down too easily is to increase distance between the AMX-50 position and the enemy. Don't worry about that: the 100 mm gun is suited for that purpose.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

This tank may be the slowest French rank IV tank, which is not a bad thing considering French tank's general dynamic gameplay at this BR. \"Don't put the tank in nasty front-line situations\" is the best advice to follow with this tank. As it is, this 800+ HP engine should be able to carry the tank to any location in good time.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

While not having any HE filler in their AP rounds, the French engineers somehow managed to optimize armour spalling on penetrating shots and muzzle velocity, making these shells very good at long-range engagements. This gun is also mounted with an autoloader, which provides it with a solid 4 seconds reload time. It has good gun depression and a fast turret traverse, which enables this tank to react quickly to flankers and take solid hulled-down position, its high gun placement minimizes the tank's silhouette behind hills.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| 100 mm Obus de rupture || APCBC || 273 || 270 || 257 || 242 || 228 || 215\n|-\n| 100 mm Obus explosif || HE || 18 || 18 || 18 || 18 || 18 || 18\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| 100 mm Obus de rupture || APCBC || 1,000 || 15 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| 100 mm Obus explosif || HE || 1,000 || 14.8 || 0 || 0.1 || 1,400 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated:''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

A large drum of seven rounds is found underneath the gun breech for rapid use.  Once this drum is empty, rounds in the hull will need to be placed in the autoloader rack before it can be used by the autoloader, which takes about 14 seconds to perform for one round.  Nine rounds are found in three racks near the bottom of the hull behind the driver and machine-gunner while the rest of the stowage is found in the side sponsons above the tracks, aside from a small rack of 5 rounds near the rear of the turret.\n\n'''Notes''':\n\n* Ammo rack 9 is the autoloader drum and takes priority in being filled at the beginning of the battle, then fills racks 8 through 1.\n* If the autoloader drum is empty, the main gun cannot fire until ammo is loaded into the autoloader drum.\n* Simply not firing when the main gun is loaded will load ammo from racks 1-8 into the ready rack, as long as there is ammo present in racks 1-8.  Firing the main gun will interrupt the loading of the ready racks.\n\n=== Machine guns ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles.

The only thing it is insufficient at is absorbing damaging shots: there are too many weak spots on this tank to take anything bigger than HMG to the front. Don't stay too close to the front line since the reverse speed will not allow the tank to escape sufficiently fast and flanking manoeuvres will make the weak sides vulnerable.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The new tank was to be the future spearhead of French armoured divisions. The French company AMX started working on a proposal which was essentially an improved Tiger II on the drawing board. The project evolved and later resulted in the AMX-50 tank. The AMX-50 present in the game is the second prototype of the project.\n\n===Development===\nIn order to save weight from the Tiger II's initial weight of 70 tons, the first AMX proposal was an underarmoured version of the Tiger II with only 30 mm armour plates. The French Army quickly indicated that such a thickness was too weak for the intended purpose. The armour of the hull was increased to 80 mm frontally and 40 mm for the sides and the weight-saving measures were then applied to other components. The original turret was changed for an oscillating turret whose design was already available and the suspension wheels were redesigned to get rid of the interleaving wheels. The new version was approved and a first prototype dubbed M4 was produced at the end of 1949 with a 90 mm SA 45 gun and a weight slightly above 50 tons. The second prototype called AMX-50/100 was produced 1 year later with the 100 mm SA 47 L/50 gun, a slightly modified turret and a weight close to 55 tons. After testing in 1952 and 1953, the French Army reclassified the AMX-50 as heavy tank as it could not reach more than 50 km/h on roads and 20 km/h off-road due to an insufficient output of the powerplant. The tank had a ratio of 15 hp/ton against the 20 expected. The availability of the more modern M47 medium tank through NATO cooperation made the need for the AMX-50 obsolete. Following its reclassification, there were several attempts to transform the AMX-50 in a real heavy tank like the AMX-50 Surbaissé or the AMX-50 Surblindé. But the need for heavy tanks would gradually disappear with the appearance of shaped charges (HEAT projectiles and missiles).\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe AMX-50 never saw either service or combat action with the French Army.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_50 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|PosWOnOGkSo|'''Best experimental vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 0:38 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|4hSjkacg4CQ|'''The Shooting Range #98''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:24 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|10q59dU32b4|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[AMX-50 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:AMX-50|[Wikipedia] AMX-50]]\n* [https://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/France/AMX-50.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> AMX-50]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AMX}}\n{{France medium tanks}}"}}
