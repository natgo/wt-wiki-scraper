In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Hot Tracks\"]].\n\nThe ASRAD-R received a number of improvements over the [[Lvrbv 701]]: The launcher array is now unmanned and located higher above the ground, which allows for the hull to remain in cover while still being effective in all directions thanks to the increased horizontal traverse angles. With access to 8 long-range supersonic missiles, the ASRAD-R proves to be quite deadly, especially against enemy helicopters.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas.
