Fitted with a newly developed 3.75 inch howitzer in an open top casemate configuration, the Alecto only completed trials after the war had ended, leading to it serving briefly with the British Army in Germany and the Middle East without seeing any combat. \n\n=== [[wt:en/news/7636-development-battle-for-arachis-alecto-mk-i-spg-en|Devblog]] ===\n\nA further development of the Tetrarch light tank concept resulted in the Mk.VIII Harry Hopkins light cruiser tank, which Vickers-Armstrongs was creating to be an airborne tank. Since the mass of the vehicle by the beginning of the production exceeded the allowable for the project, and the design itself still required serious improvements, the company's engineering team decided to continue their work, turning the project into a light self-propelled unit with a 3.75”” howitzer Q.F. 95mm. The chassis engine compartment was completely unified with the Harry Hopkins, while the combat compartment and the gun were completely new for the series. The SPG is called Alecto I (or Alecto Mk. I) went to the testing in 1944 and, after implementing new changes (again with an increase in the mass of the machine), the self-propelled guns were built in a small batch by June 1945. The war had already ended by that time, and all units built were used mainly for training purposes and were decommissioned in 1955.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_alecto_mk_1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Alecto I WTWallpaper001.jpg|\nFile:Alecto I WTWallpaper002.jpg|\nFile:Alecto I WTWallpaper003.jpg|\nFile:Alecto I WTWallpaper004.jpg|\nFile:Alecto I WTWallpaper005.jpg|\nFile:Alecto I WTWallpaper006.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n* [[Ho-Ro]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7636-development-battle-for-arachis-alecto-mk-i-spg-en|[Devblog] “Battle for Arachis”: Alecto Mk.
