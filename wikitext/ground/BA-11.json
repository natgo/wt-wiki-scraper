In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]] as a reward for [[Season 2: Attack from the Sea]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->\n\nArmour on the BA-11 is unfortunately inadequate against most tank armaments that it can encounter. It's only thick enough to resist rifle-calibre machine gun fire, whereas heavy machine gun rounds have more than enough power to shred the car's body apart. In terms of surviving a frontal encounter with a tank shell, the only hope is that the engine and fuel tank modules will stop the shell from reaching the crew compartment. However, the BA-11 is vulnerable to overpressure so an HE shell will at best immobilize the BA-11 if not outright destroy it.\n\nIf shot, the front compartment with engine and transmission module can immobilise the vehicle. The center driving compartment containing the driver and another crew member, with the transmission right underneath to, again, cripple the vehicle's mobility. The fighting compartment in the rear with the turret is fully stowed with ammunition with the gun crew, and so a shot there can cause an ammunition detonation that would make short work of the BA-11's life.\n\nFinally, the roof armour on the {{PAGENAME}} is not sufficient against most type of strafing attacks either, so enemy aircraft going for a gun run will be dangerous to a {{PAGENAME}} user.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (turret front, gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Soviet heavy armoured vehicle BA-11 was one of the typical examples of this type of vehicle. It was created on the basis of a shortened chassis from the military ZIS-6 - a three-axle off-road truck designed on a scheme of 6x4 (rear wheel drive). The new chassis designed by engineers of the Moscow Automobile Plant was supposed to provide the armoured car greater payload and a better cross-country ability which allows improvements in the armour and a better  off-road performance in the vehicle.\n\nCompared to the armoured vehicles of the B-6 and B-10 series which had been designed on the basis of the GAZ-AAA truck, the armour of the BA-11 has been increased by 1.5-2 times and in some places, the BA-11 was slightly better armoured than the T-26 and BT-7 tanks. With the increased weight up to 8 tons, the vehicle maintained good driving characteristics: a speed of up to 64 km/h on the highway and 26 km/h over terrain. As well as in the BA-10 the designers also provided overall tracks which were able to help the armoured car to overcome particularly difficult areas. The gun and the turret of the vehicle also receives a 45 mm 20-K cannon from the BA-10 in the turret.\n\nThe heavy BA-11 armoured vehicle was produced in limited edition in 1939 and participated in battles at the early stages of WWII. In 1942 it was withdrawn from service.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6563-development-ba-11-tank-on-wheels-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_ba_11 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:BA-11 camo.jpg|Bicolor summer camouflage, reward during the WWM [[Season 2: Attack from the Sea]]\nFile:BA-11.jpg|\nFile:Ba 11 03.jpg|\nFile:Ba 11 04.jpg|\nFile:Ba 11 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|WsIqFwM77Vs|'''{{PAGENAME}}: \"The Russian Racer\" Review & Gameplay''' - ''BaconGaming''|uvpgVrhoG2A|'''{{PAGENAME}} wheeled soviet tank is JUST RELEASED!''' - ''HowToPlay1337''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6563-development-ba-11-tank-on-wheels-en|BA-11: Tank on wheels]]\n* [[wt:en/news/6565-event-world-war-season-attack-from-the-sea-en|World War: season \"Attack from the Sea\"]]\n\n{{USSR light tanks}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
