In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.89 \"Imperial Navy\"]] as one of the rewards for Operation H.E.A.T. It uses the same chassis as the [[BT-7]] and as such, possesses the same armour, engine and crew layout but adds a new turret fitted with the 76 mm F-32 gun.\n\nLike the BT-7 before it, it is very fast while having light armour, which at its BR can be penetrated by virtually all vehicles, meaning it must rely on stealth and speed even more than its predecessor. It comes armed with the much more powerful 76 mm F-32 cannon, which has higher penetration and explosive mass, allowing it to easily knock out larger tanks from the side with a single shot. It also comes with a pintle-mounted light machine gun, a rarity among early Soviet tanks, allowing it slightly more AA firepower. \n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe crew compartment is very small and inhabited by the driver, a loader and a gunner. The turret crew operate in a very small environment, so it is very rare that only one of them would die from a shot. \"Not getting shot at\" is the best advice for the crew to survive.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (MG port)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=620|rbMinHp=354}}\n\nAs a light tank, the {{PAGENAME}} is very agile and has a very high top speed. Due to its high HP ratio, the acceleration is outstanding: 59 km/h in about 6 seconds off-road. The brakes are powerful and will make it skid rather than slow down when travelling at maximum speed. The reverse speed is good (-11 km/h): it will get you out of a dangerous situation quickly. While the {{PAGENAME}} lacks neutral steering, the turning speed on the spot is still good (8 km/h). It reaches 20 km/h when fording, 27 km/h when driving uphill with some speed built-up but only 13 km/h uphill from a stop. The narrow tracks will grant you a decent mobility on hard terrain (solid ground, roads) but poor mobility on soft terrain (mud, snow, sand), especially when changing direction as the tracks are long and close to one another. Light obstacles (fences and bushes) are not a problem but medium to large obstacles (posts, trees, concrete blocks and parked vehicles) will reduce your mobility: avoid them.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Its below-average muzzle velocity still allows for pretty flat firing trajectories. The accuracy drop is noticeable from a 1,000 m distance and becomes a handicap over 1,300 m. The rotation speed of the turret is rather slow but average compared to other tanks at the same rank or battle rating. The elevation angle of the gun is important, allowing you to fire at an elevated position but the depression angle is poor, making it impossible to fire from behind a ridge. Lacking a stabilizer, the tank can't reliably fire on the move. The reload time of the gun is rather long but in line with other tanks equipped with a 76 mm cannon at the same BR. The gun recoil is average for a Soviet vehicle and not important enough to throw your gun off target after firing.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\nThe available ammunition allows for engaging all types of targets:\n\n* '''BR-350A (MD-5 fuze)''': APHEBC; an armour-piercing shell with high explosive mass that will destroy any tank it penetrates but has an average penetration power.\n* '''BR-350B (MD-8 fuze)''': APHEBC; the same shell but with an increased penetration power at the cost of slightly less explosive filler.\n* '''OF-350M''': HE; useful for destroying open and lightly armoured vehicles.\n* '''Sh-354T''': Shrapnel; useful against vehicles that are resistant to the HE shells but too thinly armoured to trigger the fuzes of AP shells.\n* '''D-350A''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| BR-350A (MD-5 fuze) || APHEBC || 78 || 76 || 69 || 61 || 53 || 47\n|-\n| BR-350B (MD-8 fuze) || APHEBC || 86 || 84 || 76 || 67 || 59 || 52\n|-\n| OF-350M || HE || 10 || 10 || 10 || 10 || 10 || 10\n|-\n| Sh-354T || Shrapnel || 37 || 35 || 29 || 25 || 20 || 17\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| BR-350A (MD-5 fuze) || APHEBC || 615 || 6.3 || 1.2 || 14 || 150 || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| BR-350B (MD-8 fuze) || APHEBC || 615 || 6.3 || 0.9 || 14 || 98.56 || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| OF-350M || HE || 615 || 6.2 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 621 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| Sh-354T || Shrapnel || 615 || 6.2 || 0.5 || 8 || 85 || 62° || 69° || 73°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Smoke shell characteristics\n|-\n!

Follow up with a shot at the driver's position if it survives.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n=== Development ===\nThe success of the [[BT-5|BT light tanks]] in Soviet service prompted additional upgrades and other developmental projects done on the design to increase its service life. The development led to the final model of the BT light tank series, the '''BT-7'''. The tank differed from the older BT-5 tank with a welded hull, redesigned hull front, and a new engine in the Model 1935 version. The '''Model 1937''' version of the BT-7 added a redesigned turret that featured sloping armour.\n\nThe BT-7 (F32) is a modification of the BT-7 Artillery model sometimes called BT-7A. The artillery model took the design of the T-26-4 turret fitted with a KT-28 short-barrelled howitzer and mounted a 76 mm (3 in) ST short-barrelled howitzer. Due to the extra weight of the turret, the BT lost its ability to drive on the road wheels. 155 BT-7A models were created, 11 converted into command versions and a few were tested with a bigger 76 mm gun, the F-32 gun designed by famous Soviet weapon designer, Vasily Grabin.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6294/current|Devblog]] ===\nThe pre-war Soviet BT-7’s stood out as reliable, manoeuvrable vehicles that worked especially well when attacking in conjunction with infantry. However, the 45mm cannon had insufficient destructive potential for combat with serious enemy fortifications. In 1939 two experimental BT-7 models were tested with a more powerful 76mm cannon: the L-11, which was then installed on early KV-1s, and the F-32, the precursor to the gun mounted on the first T-34s. The L-11 turned out to be too large to be installed on the BT-7’s small turret, but the F-32 not only fit well on the tank’s turret, but also beat the competing gun in a number of tactical and technical characteristics. The committee unequivocally recommended the BT-7 (F-32) modification for serial production, but, due to a series of factors, the tank never saw mass production, and only the experimental model was ever produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_bt_7a_f32 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|yNt_CfnoyCw|'''The Shooting Range #161''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|SA4z2cWvcHg|'''{{PAGENAME}}, Soviet, Tier-2, Light Tank, Operation HEAT Reward''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|eKVYCmjw5jM|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[M24 (Family)]]\n* [[Crusader Mk III]]\n* [[AMX-13 (FL11)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6294/current|[Devblog] BT-7 (F-32): Assault Scout]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Morozov}}\n{{USSR light tanks}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
