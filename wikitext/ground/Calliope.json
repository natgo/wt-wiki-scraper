In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} American medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 \"Weapons of Victory\"]]. Though using the base model of a [[M4|M4 Sherman]], it has a 60 round rocket rack sitting above the turret that fires 114 mm rockets at a general location. While giving the team a good edge in firepower, the rocket rack also presents a large weak point that can be targeted with a high-explosive round for an ammo-rack detonation.\n\nThis vehicle has guide rails for 114 mm M8 rockets mounted on an M4 tank turret. The main cannon is still usable at any time.\n\nThe rocket armaments greatest disadvantage is the inaccuracy, despite its fin-stabilized tail. There is no guidance system, thus every barrage needs to be fired in an arc, greatly increasing the warhead dispersion. Furthermore, the stabilizing fins showed little impact in lateral guidance when fired from the ground, in comparison with their aerial version.\n\nAnother drawback is the small warhead with only a 1.9 kg of high explosive filler. Adequate against barricades and entrenchments, but lacking in stopping power against heavy armoured vehicles such as tanks and pillboxes. It is recommended to use multiple rockets on even medium tanks. Additionally, as with any other ground vehicle firing unguided rockets, the weapon will present a very loud but distinct firing signature, allowing enemies to identify the type of vehicle as well as its location on the map. The distinct smoke trail from fired rockets can also reveal the position of the vehicle. However, the higher fire rate of the M8 rockets allows for multiple volleys of rockets to be fired quickly at a target. The ensuing flash, fire and smoke effects from constant barrage against a target can temporarily blind targets and thus can be used as an emergency smoke screen. This rocket launcher system allowed fire not only from a defilade position but also from point-blank range.\n\nDrawbacks are the inaccuracy of the volleys due to arc fire and the lack of anti-tank damage. The warheads are pure HE, thus they need to hit thinly armoured areas, like rooftops and armour hulls above the tracks to be able to deal with any sort of damage. You may wish to get close to a target before firing a volley to have the best chance of your barrage hitting the target.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

The mount is also a separate ammo rack, if hit it can destroy the rockets and a repair will have to be performed. Machine gun fire can also destroy the rockets and large machine fire from large calibre machine guns, aircraft and autocannons or larger will destroy the rack and rockets.\n\nWith a large calibre HE round, a single hit to the rocket rack can knock out the entire tank. Since the round detonates all the rockets in the rack explode, causing an apocalyptic explosion which blows the turret off and knocks out the crew.\n\nThe rocket rack is not protected by any armour plates, it only has 5 mm structural steel. Since the rocket racks are installed above the turret, it allows you to fire over objects. However, the disadvantage is you can no longer hide behind rocks and objects for safety.\nUsing the M8 rockets, the M8 rockets are not armour piercing they are high explosive meaning they will detonate when they hit something. The M8 rockets can be used to distract enemy tankers and cause lots of damage to their tanks. Another advantage of using the rockets, they fire rapidly and can knock out light tanks and lightly armoured fighting vehicles with ease.\n\nThe Sherman Calliope packs the legendary 75 mm, M3 cannon the cannon can make short work of enemy tanks. To best use this cannon, use the shot and AP rounds. It's best not to have any rockets in your rocket ammo rack, when you engage in short close range combat, due to the risk of a HE or an arty round penetrating and knocking out your tanks by destroying the rocket racks.\n\nHowever, using the cannon and rockets together can be an exceptionally good combination – the quick reload time of the cannon and combined with the rockets makes for a very potent tank. To get the best out of this, use the terrain to your advantage. Use buildings and trees to hide behind, then pop out when the enemy drives by and shoot them fire the rockets to cause disorientation, they will produce a thick dark cloud preventing your target from locating you. Then fire the 75 mm M3 cannon into the enemy turret and knock it out.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The idea of rocket launchers isn't new at this period, they present some advantage over the standard mortar or howitzer. The rocket launcher can launch massive amounts of high-explosive ammunition at a longer distance at a shorter time with a greater psychological impact than normal artillery, at the price of a longer reload time and less accuracy. The Soviets showed the best utilization of this weapon with their ''Katyushas'', having a whole bunch of them fire at a designated target, minimizing accuracy loss with a full area saturation of fire. The effectiveness of this system prompted the Allies to start producing some form of multiple rocket launcher system as well.\n\nIn 1943, the project began in the United States and the design was to use the current [[M4|M4 Sherman]] tanks in service to mount the rocket launchers to bring into combat. The design, developed by Victor Hawkins, had a rocket mount on the Sherman turret with sixty launch tubes, all made to fire the 4.5 in. M8 rockets. The project gave the experimental tank design the designation '''T34''', and the troops adopted the name '''\"Calliope\"''', which was the name of a steam organ and has a similar look.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThese rocket launcher tanks were sent to France in 1944, although many never saw combat for various reasons. During its development, three different variants were made. The original T34 had 60 tubes for the 4.5 in. rockets with 36 fixed tubes on top and 24 on the bottom able to be jettisoned (except on the [[M4A1|M4A1 Sherman]] variant). The second, T34E1, has the 24 jettisonable tubes replaced by 28 tubes, though the total tubes were still 60. The T34E2 had the rocket calibre increased from 4.5 in. to 7.2 in. with the same 60 tubes. This saw combat during the 1944-1945 time span.\n\nHowever, the modifications of the Shermans seem unnecessary as the war progressed, new development had the rocket launcher system mated to trucks, armoured chassis, and jeeps so the tanks could be left alone to do its purpose. But when the Calliope saw service in the Pacific and Europe, its performance was moderately successful. The T34 was replaced by the T40 \"Whiz Bang\" Sherman, which was a Sherman with a tank-mounted multiple rocket launcher system like the T34, but only saw combat in the last few months of the war and had the 7.2 in. rockets.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nA jet-powered volley-fire system on the base of regular Sherman tank, it received the addition of a T34E1 launch system with a tubes for M8 missiles. The first versions had the body of a T34, which did not allow them to fire the tank cannon, so a modification of the T34E1 was created that was equipped with a special adapter that allowed the tank cannon to be fired on that body.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_m4_sherman_calliope Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|RuBjkyZT6Yw|'''The Shooting Range #6''' - ''Challenge'' section at 05:58 discusses hunting aircraft with the Calliope.|vtSiQhePXWc|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other M4 tanks in the game\n* [[M4]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[15 cm Pz.W.42]]\n* [[BM-13N]]\n* [[Cromwell V (RP-3)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/775/|[Devblog] РCЗО T34 Sherman Calliope]]\n\n{{USA medium tanks}}\n{{USA premium ground vehicles}}"}}
