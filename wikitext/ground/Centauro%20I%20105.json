This AFV can fill a variety of roles with frightening efficiency.\n\n'''As a sniper'''\n\nIn a sniping role, the Centauro has two primary advantages: it has access to HEAT-FS, and it has thermal imaging. The HEAT-FS round has good velocity and is often more than enough to deal significant damage to any poor enemy tank that enters your gunsights. The thermal imaging mod allows you to pick out targets and countersnipe like nobody's business, letting you be able to dominate the battlefield for your team.\n\n'''As a flanker'''\n\nAs a flanker, the Centauro's lightning fast speed and two-plane stabilizer allows this AFV to quickly obliterate unaware enemy tanks and move on before anyone notices. This deadly combo makes the Centauro one of, if not ''the best'' vehicle for flanking in the entire game. A resourceful Centauro player can often make use of their low profile and fast speed to quickly break through enemy lines and wreck havoc on tunnel-visioned snipers.\n\n'''As a Quick Response Force'''\n\nThe Centauro's fast speed and very deadly gun, along with its aforementioned stabilizer and thermals also make it a very good choice for a QRF, ''especially'' on maps covered mostly in asphalt, like Cargo Port, American Desert, or Alaska, to name a few. The fast speed of the Centauro allows to to quickly move to a capture point or to kill a pesky spawncamping Rooikat at a moments notice, and its two-plane stabilizer and thermal imaging lets it quickly find and dispatch its target.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nDevelopment of the B1 Centauro began during the 1980s after the Italian Army issued a set of requirements for a new vehicle that would have equivalent firepower to the Leopard 1 MBT in Italian service at the time, but with greater combat mobility.\n\nIn response to this, the Italian companies Fiat, Iveco and Oto Melara joined forces to begin developing the vehicle requested by the Italian Army. In this joint venture, Fiat and Iveco were developing the vehicle's hull and power supply, whilst Oto Melara took care of the vehicle's turret and weapon systems.\n\nIn 1986, the final prototype of the B1 Centauro project was unveiled on Sardinia. The presented vehicle was an eight-wheeled lightly armoured tank destroyer, equipped with a derived modification of the L7 105mm cannon, capable of reaching a very high top speed and covering large distances under its own power.\n\nImpressed by the B1 Centauro, the Italian Military placed orders for a number of vehicles, with the first ones entering service as early as 1992. Early on in its service life, the Centauro received an ERA upgrade package that allowed for the installation of [[Centauro ROMOR|ROMOR ERA]] packs on the vehicle's hull and turret sides as well as rear.\n\nB1 Centauros took part in most major conflicts that defined the '90s and early 2000s, most notably in former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan and others. Apart from the Italian Army, other noteworthy operators of the Centauro include Spain, Jordan and Oman.\n\nAround 400 B1 Centauros were built until 2006, including some other derived modifications of the vehicle filling other roles. The B1 Centauro still serves with the Italian as well as other armed forces to this day.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5922-development-b1-centauro-the-wheeled-cheetah-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_b1_centauro Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|chjZ6Hra--c|'''Best wheeled tanks''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 05:19 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|i6UxXDaqcLI|'''Why would someone want to play usual tanks if we have this one? {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''HowToPlay1337''|3-ebe29V-68|'''{{PAGENAME}} - When The First Game Is Just Right''' - ''Napalmratte''|q-a9MXzpDEk|'''The Shooting Range #134''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|KpWGXcI9PQc|'''The Shooting Range #129''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:48 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Rooikat Mk.1D]]\n* [[PTL02]]\n* [[WMA301]]\n* [[AMX-10RC]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5922-development-b1-centauro-the-wheeled-cheetah-en|[Devblog] B1 Centauro: The Wheeled Cheetah]]\n* [[Wikipedia:B1_Centauro|[Wikipedia] B1 Centauro]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer OTO Melara}}\n{{Italy light tanks}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
