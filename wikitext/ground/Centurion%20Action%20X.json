The aim of the project was to improve the Centurion's ballistic protection by fitting the vehicle with the recently developed 'mantletless' turret design. The turret was fitted on a Centurion Mk.7 hull and featured thick, heavily sloped surfaces which further increased its effectiveness.\n\nFurthermore, the vehicle was tested with both the QF 20-pdr as well as the 105mm L7 cannon. In the end however, only a couple prototypes were built and tested in addition to a few turrets being used separately for ballistic trials. The Centurion Action X never passed the testing stage and was thus also not ordered into production. However, the experience gained during its development, specifically regarding the use of the mantletless turret, was later incorporated into subsequent tank designs such as the FV4202 and the well-known Chieftain main battle tank.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=medium_tank&vehicle=uk_centurion_action_x Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Vu3VyrhT5r4|'''Should You Buy The {{PAGENAME}}?''' - ''Sako Sniper''|5tnrZ7_gXk0|'''{{PAGENAME}} - Tank Review''' - ''Napalmratte''|8uNloxGw-6I|'''{{PAGENAME}}''' - ''ConeOfArc''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[Centurion (Family)]]\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same gun\n\n* [[Charioteer Mk VII]]\n* [[FV4202]]\n* [[Caernarvon]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the tank;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6427-development-centurion-action-x-the-chiefturion-en|[Devblog] Centurion Action X - The Chiefturion]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/centurion-mantletless-turret/ <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Centurion Mantletless Turret]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Department of Tank Design}}\n{{Britain medium tanks}}\n{{Britain premium ground vehicles}}"}}
