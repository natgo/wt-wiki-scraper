Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 \"Assault\"]]. It is equipped with the well-known British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder (76 mm)|QF 17-pounder]] mounted on a new hull that definitively makes the Cromwell chassis outdated.\n\nThis tank does not play like any of the preceding British vehicles: while its mobility is below average for a rank IV medium, it compensates with armour, meaning that you will actually be able to withstand frontal combat and return fire, even if you get hit. It is the first medium to feature the late-game British armour pattern: a strong turret, thick and well-angled upper-glacis, weak lower glacis and thin sides. British tankers must get used to this configuration since it is found on every following medium tank.\n\nThe Centurion Mk 1 moves away from the familiar Cromwell chassis. While not being as fast or manoeuvrable, It does have sloped frontal armour, a strongly armoured turret, and a good QF 17-pounder gun with access to APDS.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Side armour can withstand autocannon fire with exceptions for HVAP rounds, so don't rely on it outside of that. If the situation becomes sticky and a tactical retreat is required, a single wide volley of smoke grenades launched from the turret can cover you from the line of sight.\n\nThe roof armour is mostly around 25 mm thick, which will protect from poorly aimed aircraft attack or HE fired by medium tanks, but will not stop artillery tanks or Soviet heavy tanks. The engine deck armour is only 8 mm thick, which is an even bigger weakspot than the familiar weakness of Churchill tanks.\n\nAll in all, its thick and sloped hull armour is the biggest upgrade from previous British medium tanks. Reaching 152 mm on the turret and a good 76 mm angled at 58° on the front hull, this tank can actually deflect shots from a lot of cannons it will face like the Soviet [[D-5T (85 mm)|D-5T]], the Japanese [[Type II Model II (75 mm)|Type II 75 mm]] and even some older German guns (if aimed poorly). This only gets better when the tank is further angled to the side.\n\nThis means, that at 500 m range the tank can actually cut into corners or simply expose its upper glacis because it will just bounce inaccurate shots from medium tanks or even weak short SPGs. This tank still has weak spots though: gun and MG mantlet, which are \"only\" 127 mm thick and barely angled, and lower glacis, which are 76 mm thick at 44°, meaning close-range shots will eventually penetrate, even in full down-tier. It also has thin side armour, meaning that the tank is vulnerable to flank attacks and compound angling cannot be done effectively without exposing the sides. \n\nThese traits mean that with some care the {{PAGENAME}} can happily stand on the front against most nations (with major exception being Germany).\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=984|rbMinHp=562}}\n\nThe Centurion easily reaches its top speed of 39 km/h on almost any ground, due to its wide tracks and a good engine, even at stock performances. It also has a refreshingly good reverse speed (~13 km/h) (compared to the dreadful reverse speed of tanks on the Cromwell chassis) and can turn on the spot quite fast.\n\nCompared to the many Cromwell based tanks before the Centurion, it does lose out on a great forward speed, only being able to reach 41 km/h (AB) / 37 km/h (RB) maximum, but in return it does receive great reverse speed of 13.4 km/h (AB)/12.1 km/h (RB), allowing for tactics that would not be recommended with the Cromwell like \"Peek-a-boos\". It also retains good maneuverability, effective neutral steering, and a very acceptable acceleration due to good power-to-weight ratio.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|QF 17-pounder (76 mm)}}\n\nThe gun does not fire any shells with explosive filler, meaning that pinpoint accuracy is needed to get reliable kills (aiming for important modules, crew, or ammo racks). This cannon's reload rate is faster than average at its BR, meaning if enemy loader is down, it will be able to land 2 shots before enemy can fire again. After having depleted the ready rack of 5 shells, the reload time increases so be mindful when advancing.\n\nAs any other tanks equipped with the [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder (76 mm)|QF 17-pounder]], you will have to grind through subpar AP, APC and APCBC shells before getting APDS. This last type of shell helps make aiming quite easy and remains effective at long ranges while not being too costly in terms of Silver Lions {{sl}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[QF 17-pounder (76 mm)|76 mm QF 17-pounder]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->\n{{main|BESA (7.92 mm)}}\n\nUnlike many turret-mounted machine guns that are co-axial, this machine gun is mounted in pintle mount similar to hull-mounted machine guns, so it is able to independently traverse on its own to a degree, a trait that is shared with the Soviet T-28. This can provide a slight advantage when the turret ring is disabled, as it can allow more accurate fire without the need to move the turret/hull.\n\nA minor issue to notice is that the machine gun has very poor elevation and is loader-controlled, meaning that it cannot target even low flying aircraft and that it will be disabled once the tank has lost two or more crew members.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[BESA (7.92 mm)|7.92 mm BESA]]\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Overview:'''\n\nThe Centurion Mk 1 is widely considered as the first Main Battle Tank (MBT), and plays in the role of a medium/heavy. The armour is more than satisfactory against most enemy weapons, although it should not be relied upon. The 17 pounder cannon is very effective against enemy armour, although its post penetration damage is lacklustre. The tank is not particularly fast, but is mobile, especially in reverse.\n\n'''Strategies:'''\n\nCenturion tank commanders should use cover and be careful for the majority of the time. When the opportunity arises, the Centurion can help lead the charge against enemy medium and heavy tanks. Centurion commanders should keep in mind that the APDS ammunition is unlikely to destroy enemy vehicles in one shot, so they may need to expose themselves to enemy fire for extended periods of time in order to secure a kill. Generally, the Centurion plays similarly to other medium tanks of the tier. It is best practice to angle the turret, but the hull should not be angled due to the thin side armour.\n\nIn terms of engagement ranges, the Centurion works well at both long and short ranges. The issue with sniping in the centurion is that it is very difficult to secure kills with the lacklustre post penetration damage. Because of this, medium and short range engagements are preferable.\n\n'''Notable Enemies:'''\n\nAt its BR, the Centurion faces many iconic German big cats like the Tiger I, the Panther and even the Tiger II. The Centurion is capable of going head to head with the big cats. The APDS rounds will slice through the Tiger I at most angles but one must be cautious of facing Tiger II, and can even penetrate the upper front plate of a Panther at close ranges or at range when using APDS. This round can even penetrate the Jagdpanther. It can also easily penetrate the hull of the IS-1 and early IS-2. Generally when firing at enemies, be careful to aim for the flat parts of the armour. APDS ammunition doesn't handle angled armour very well most of the time.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Fast firing 17-pounder armament with APDS rounds\n* Good gun depression of -12°\n* Tough round and sloped armour that is quite resistant to the 85mm, 76mm and even the German 88 mm (KwK 36) guns at medium/long range\n* Turret's top armour is thick, can resist most aircraft guns and some HE shells\n* Average mobility and decent manoeuvrability\n* Good reverse speed and neutral steering\n* Benefits greatly from the learning curve of the Comet I and Challenger, their players will find themselves at home when playing the Centurion\n* Mastering this tank will provide a good learning curve for the next Centurion variants\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Precision and knowledge of enemy tanks are required, because of the APDS localized damage\n* Weak side armour, angling the armour too much will result in the side armour being penetrated\n* Vulnerable to high ground and tall tanks due to reliance on angled armour\n* The Centurion Mk has a slow top speed for a medium tank\n* Unlike its later iterations, no [[Gun stabilizer|gun stabilizer]]\n* Some-what weak lower frontal plate (LFP); ammo rack also present there, a weakness carried over to all British tanks onward\n* Top armour covering the engine is poor, only 8 mm\n* Only 6 shells available before the first order ammo rack is depleted, leading to a longer reload time\n* Frontal turret cheek armour is flat\n* Many angles and faces on the turret can yield various results when shot, armour is ultimately unreliable\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n===Design===\nIn 1943, the British War Office mandated the Directorate of Tank Design to start working on a new heavy cruiser tank. The requirements stated that the new tank should be capable of withstanding a direct hit from the infamous German 88 mm gun, while providing greater protection against mines as well as staying under the 40-tons limit imposed by logistical constraints. The tank also had to offer a good cross-country capability when offroad, a high reverse speed was required but not a high forward top speed. The new project, called A41, had to surpass the Comet tank in all areas except the main armament for which the 17-pdr gun was still deemed effective enough to deal with enemy tanks.\n\n===Development===\nEarly in the development, it became clear that the 40-tons limit imposed by logistical constraints (transport trailers, Bailey truss bridge, etc.) could not be held if the other requirements were to stay the same (armour and turret size). The limit was raised to 50 tons and the tank's maximal size for railway bridges and tunnels was also scrapped.\nThe hull was designed larger, welded and with sloped armour. The turret was made of thick cast armour, with the sides sloped and overall wider than previous tanks to fit the 17-pdr gun and 3 crew members.\nInside the hull was installed a Rolls-Royce turbojet, the engine found on the Gloster Meteor.\nThe suspension was changed to a Horstmann suspension to reduce its size and encroachment while allowing for modular maintenance in the field.\nPrototypes for evaluation arrived in Belgium less than a month after the end of WW2 in Europe and manufacturing began later in 1945.\nThe new A41 tank was subsequently designated the Centurion. During its test phase, it demonstrated better performance than the Comet in all areas and was adopted by the British Army.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe Centurion Mk 1 never saw combat and was quickly upgraded to Mk 2 and 3 with the introduction of the 20-pdr gun.\nThe first Centurions to see combat were British and Canadian Centurions Mk 3 in Korea in the 1950s where the tank gained its laurels and became a major export success.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_centurion_mk_1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|I5sGIacZ5jU|'''Centurion Mk1 Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|XThuUn_3u30|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review - APDS Only''' - ''Napalmratte''|HsiYQG4dKaQ|'''British Blitzkrieg - {{PAGENAME}} Review''' - ''MikeGoesBoom''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same gun and ammunition\n\n* [[Challenger]]\n* [[Black Prince]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4515-development-centurion-mk-i-a-tank-for-a-new-era-en|[Devblog] Centurion Mk I: A Tank for a New Era]]\n* [[wikipedia:Centurion (tank)|[Wikipedia] Centurion]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/UK/FV-4200_Centurion <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> FV4007 Centurion]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Department of Tank Design}}\n{{Britain medium tanks}}"}}
