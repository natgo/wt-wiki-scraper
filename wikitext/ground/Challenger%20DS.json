In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Danger Zone\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nOverall, the armour on the Challenger DS is exactly the same as the tech tree counterpart, the [[Challenger Mk.3]]. However, it lacks the additional ROMOR ERA and the sides armour package. It gets a slight but negligible upgrade on the lower frontal plate compared to the [[Challenger Mk.2]] as it has spare tracks strapped on the LFP. While it is a Challenger Mk.3, it is most comparable to the Challenger Mk.2 in terms of armour. The upper half of the turret cheeks are capable of withstanding almost all kinetic penetrators and will stop most chemical projectiles with less than 800 mm penetration, while the lower half won't protect against most top-rank rounds. The hull composite is only good against lower penetrating APFSDS rounds such as [[T-55AM-1|T-55AM]], and can also withstand some chemical munitions, but it is not advised to rely on this armour. The rest of the tank (turret and hull sides, lower front plate) has decent protection against chemical rounds due to the add on armour, ERA, and thick turret sides.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\nWhile it is slower than Western MBTs at its BR, is it not a slow platform. It holds a fast top speed for both forward and reverse. Despite being a heavy vehicle, the brake distance is surprisingly low, between 20-30 m at top speed. It has the ability to do neutral steering relatively fast and, since it comes with all upgrades, it immediately gets the tracks modification which significantly improve this ability. It has little to medium impact when crossing muddy terrain, wet and snowy terrain, but nothing that impacts performance significantly. Thanks to not having the additional armour package, the cross-country capabilities of the Challenger DS are significantly increased, being able to easily traverse and cross over long trenches, deep craters and through steep terrains up to a certain level.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,860|rbMinHp=1,061}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

It it keeps the same ammunition as the Challenger Mk.2 and previous Chieftain Mk.10, making the ballistic performance identical. The L23 comes as the stock round with a significant armour penetration at the cost of reduced penetration angle. L23A1 has much better angle penetration at the cost of reduced armour penetration.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[L11A5 (120 mm)|120 mm L11A5]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!
