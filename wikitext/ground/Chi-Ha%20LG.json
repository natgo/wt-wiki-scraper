In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}} / Long 12cm SPG''' ({{Annotation|長十二糎自走砲|Naga-Jūni Senchimētoru Ji Hashi-Hō}}) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Raining Fire\"]].\n\nThis one-off prototype was made with a 12cm cruiser gun placed on the hull of a Chi-Ha to provide firepower in the defence of the Japanese homeland if the Americans invaded.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nWhile it shares the hull of a regular Chi-Ha, the gun crew is almost completely exposed as the turret got removed in replacement of a naval gun. The gunshield itself is quite small and offers only protection against rifle calibre fire.\n\nThe best way of protecting the gun and keeping it operational is angling the gun itself when taking MG fire so that the gunner is always behind the breech, this will expose other gun crew but when taking close-range MG fire, there's not much else to do other than attempt to retreat while keeping the gun operational.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull)\n* Structural steel (Gun breech and mount)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\nWhile the hull and engine are the same, most non-essentials were scrapped from the Chi-Ha 12cm to reduce weight so the main gun wouldn't weigh an additional toll to the hull. After removing the turret, radio equipment, MGs and cuts in the hull, the tank comes down to almost the same weight of a regular [[Chi-Ha]] and hence performs the same.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=241|rbMinHp=150}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nAs a glass-cannon sniper with hefty reload, modifications are down to personal preference, either get engine performance upgrades to get to a sniper spot sooner or get the gun upgraded so aiming it down on a target doesn't take too much time.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nWith its powerful gun but lacking protection, the Chi-Ha LG should be played as a sniper. The good muzzle velocity and powerful shells (with up 1.7 kg of explosive filler) make it a threat for every vehicle. However, being able to carry only 10 shells is a disadvantage. Staying near captured points is ideal to refill your ammunition storage when necessary but it will expose you to artillery strikes. With its massive gun and gun breech, enemy tanks will likely target you first, so stay behind bushes or cover. Also, staying near buildings or trees will give the enemy planes a harder time to see you. Avoid open fields. With its open gun shield, armour is non existent. Even 7,92 mm machine guns can knock out the whole crew (only the driver is protected). When no machine guns or autocannons are used by the enemy, the Chi-Ha LG can get very survivable. If the enemy fires a shell at you, they will most likely hit the driver or one of the two loaders, leaving the rest of the crew alive. Despite having a 120 mm gun with good muzzle velocity, it only has 103 mm of penetration: that means the \"point and click\" option won't always work, you have to aim shots precisely.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n* [[M4A3 (105)]]: This low-rank Sherman has strong enough frontal armour, to withstand a 120 mm shell. Try shooting at the turret around the gun mantlet. It won't be easy, but a successful hit will reward you with a knock out.\n* [[KV-1 (L-11)]]: This heavy tank could be a hard nut to crack for the LG if faced frontally. When the KV-1 is unangled, try to shoot the driver's port or the armour on the gun mantlet. When angled, shoot the armour near the gun mantlet only.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This made it a great testbed for heavier weapons and equipment.\n\n;Design\n\nOne of these additions/variants was a Japanese Navy Construction Headquarters refit of the Chi-Ha to carry the [[120 mm/45 10th year type (120 mm)|12 cm/45 10th Year naval cannon]] at the end of the war. Information of the development of the Chi-Ha Long Gun is scarce but what is certain is that they were to be constructed in defence of the homeland in-case of the highly probable American invasion, target allied armour and reposition after being shown.\n\nVery slight changes took place with the most notable being the addition of a muzzle brake. The Chi-Ha would be simply used as a moving platform and hence all the default equipment from turret, hull machine gun, radio equipment and other interior pieces were stripped in exchange for ammo storage. The 12cm cannon was bolted on the hull and used similarly to the [[Archer]] in practice, firing from the rear to maintain recoil levels while firing.\n\nThe crew consisted out of 5 people; the driver, tank commander, two gun crew, and an ammunition carrier. The cannon could elevate 20° and decline to -10°. Operating the cannon wasn't an easy task either due to the set-up of the gun on the plain back of the Chi-Ha. On top of the fire rate of 2 shells per minute, this would take a massive toll once in actual combat.\n\n;Usage\n\nThe first test took place in April of 1945 on mobility and firing. 30 shots were fired at varying distances with upgraded cannon sights, with the longest shot during the test being around 3 km. No discrete information about penetration capabilities were recorded or made it to the post-war reports.\n\nWhile production plans were approved, no further vehicles beyond the prototype were recorded as being built or near completion by the end of the war.\n\nThe prototype recorded by the US was found with the Yokosuka 15th unit and is the only footage on said vehicle.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6840-development-chi-ha-long-gun-the-last-chance-gun-en|Devblog]] ===\nThis curious prototype of a self-propelled gun was discovered in the territory of the Yokosuka naval base after Imperial Japan surrendered in WWII. The 120 mm naval gun was installed on a turntable mounted to the chassis of a Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank. It was obvious, that the self-propelled gun was assembled in a rush - the high losses of Japan in the final stages of WWII and a shortage of military production forced the army and naval commands to look for any way to protect the island metropolia of the Empire from the threat of an Allied landing.\n\nThe self-propelled gun did not have any protection, the large calibre of the cannon and the weak platform of the medium tank presupposed firing mainly direct fire and in the rather limited arcs of forward and backward to avoid overturning due to the heavy recoil. Despite all these shortcomings, such vehicles were supposed to go into series for rapid deployment in dangerous sectors of the coastal defense line for the Japanese islands and firing at a line-of-sight distance at approaching enemy forces.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n{{main|Chi-Ha (Family)#Media|l1=Media of the Type 97 Chi-Ha}}\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_navy_120mm_spg Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Chi-Ha Long Gun (1).png|\nFile:Chi-Ha Long Gun (3).png|\nFile:Chi-Ha Long Gun (2).png|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|GpCq7QDEjBk|'''The Shooting Range #220''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:28 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|-wIA6AuMBYo|Captured Experimental ''Long 12cm Chi-Ha''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related Development\n\n* Directly Related:\n** [[Chi-Ha Kai|Type 97 Chi-Ha]] <small>(base hull)</small>\n\n* Related:\n** [[Chi-Ha Short Gun|Type 97 Chi-Ha Short Gun]] <small>(another navy variant)</small>\n\n;Tanks of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl.]]\n* [[VFW]]\n* [[YaG-10 (29-K)]]\n* [[QF 3.7 Ram]]\n* [[Pvkv II]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6840-development-chi-ha-long-gun-the-last-chance-gun-en|[Devblog] Chi-Ha Long Gun: The Last Chance Gun]]\n\n{{Japan tank destroyers}}"}}
