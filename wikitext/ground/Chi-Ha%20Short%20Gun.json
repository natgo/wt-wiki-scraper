It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]]. The {{Specs|name}} was made available as a pre-order [[wt:en/news/4379-japanese-pre-order-packs-en|premium pack]] as Type 97 Chi-Ha 12cm for the release of the Japanese ground tree.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is a Naval refit of the [[Chi-Ha Kai]] with a [[Navy short gun (120 mm)]], it keeps the mobility from the [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Chi-Ha]] chassis but loses the turret rotation speed due the added weight of the gun. The {{PAGENAME}} is a later iteration of the [[Chi-Ha]] with a modified turret coming from the [[Chi-Ha Kai]] which was made to support navy infantry as a gun tank during the defense of the homeland.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!--   Describe armour protection.

The engine has been upgraded, from the Mitsubishi A6120VD air-cooled straight-six diesel with 120 hp to a Mitsubishi SA12200VD air-cooled V12 diesel with 170 hp. As such, the top speed has increased from 27 km/h on the [[I-Go Ko]] to 40 km/h on the [[Chi-Ha]].\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

However, the shell contains 2.64 kg of TNT equivalent, which is enough to cause a lethal overpressure damage against almost any enemy the tank has to face at its BR.\n\nIt should be noted that while the shell is certainly powerful, it is not as powerful as the [[Ho-Ro]]'s 150 mm howitzer rounds. This means careful aim is still needed when facing a more well-armoured opponents. Against these targets, aim at any deflective angles that can cause the explosion effect to deflect on the weak hull roof.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Navy short gun (120 mm)|120 mm Navy short gun]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

With awfully slow turret traverse and poor shell trajectory harming the tank's combat effectiveness. However, with each shell having 2.64 kg of TNT equivalent of explosives, it can easily deal overpressure damage against most tank it will face.\n\nMost lightly armoured vehicles and tanks with less than 30 mm of armour with will be able to be destroyed from either hull break or crew knock-out wherever you hit. But when you start opposing medium to heavy tanks, you should fall back for friendlies to deal with the target. It might be possible fire a shot to deal overpressure damage against weak hull roof, but it's a tricky shot and won't always deal a fatal blow on first hit.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Additionally, there was a small storage compartment added onto the back of the ShinHoTo Chi-Ha turret.\n\n=== Combat usage ===\nThe only certain information on this variant is that only a dozen or so vehicles were built and all were assigned to the Yokosuka No. 16 Special Land Battle Corps. The Chi-Ha's weren't the only vehicles assigned to this squadron and saw service next to the [[Ka-Mi|Type 2 ''Ka-Mi'']] and Type 3 ''Ka-Chi'' amphibious tanks.\n\nThese vehicles would most likely have seen service in defense of the homeland next to the SNLF infantry. But in-case that these tanks would be required to move to forward islands, they would most likely be transport by [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft]]'s just like the infantry accompanied and escorted by the Amphibious tanks during landings.\n\nThere's only a handful of images of Chi-Ha 120 mm's, all being American and taken at the naval yard in Sasebo, Japan, October 1945.
