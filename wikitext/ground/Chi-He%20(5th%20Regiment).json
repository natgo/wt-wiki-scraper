In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|一式中戦車（戦車第五連隊仕様）「チへ」|Ichi-Shiki Chū-Sensha (Sensha Dai Go Rentai Shiyō) [Chi-He]}}) is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Regia Marina\"]].\n\nIt is a regular Chi-He in service by the 1st Tank Division, 2nd Armored Brigade, 5th Armored Regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army. It comes with a unique camouflage and 3 distinct decals on all available camouflages for the tank.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThere is nothing impressive here in terms of armour, the Chi-He features 50 mm, poorly angled, frontal armour. This is not the kind of plate that can take any punishment at the battle rating, it will only bounce poorly aimed shots. The five-man crew inside makes the tank very survivable, leaving some room for mistakes. Side armour is vulnerable to heavy machine gun and autocannon fire, so beware flanking fast tanks.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Machine gun ports)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Want to be first on the spot? With some skill/luck, the Chi-He can! Want to flank? follow other light tanks in the move, provide them with enhanced firepower! The enemy team is coming over? Hit the gas (in a rearward position) and fire while retreating.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Plus, this fires APHE shells, which do great post-penetration damage. Comparatively, the [[20-K (45 mm)]] gun on Russian BR 1.0-2.7 tanks has only 62 mm of penetration in similar conditions. A top-mounted MG is really useful when dealing with unarmoured SPG and SPAA one might encounter at the battle-rating.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind compared to [[Chi-Ha Kai]] is that it still retains the same hand-cranked turret with additional 25 mm plates to improve the frontal armour to a max of 50 mm. This however slows down the turret rotations speeds due the added weight.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Type 1 (47 mm)|47 mm Type 1]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

This will result in a very similar playstyle as the Chi-Ha Kai with the added benefits of being an upgrade.\n\nUnlike the [[Chi-Ha Kai|Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai]], the Type 1 Chi-He has some more armour and a stronger engine to rely on and it is able to brawl on its own with the fast fire rate. But as previously mentioned on [[Chi-He#Main armament|Main armament]], the Chi-He retains the same hand-cranked turret with additional armour, slowing down the already mediocre turning time by a slight amount.\n\nLiterally on top of armour and engine upgrades, the Chi-He gets an additional pintle point anti-aircraft machine gun, even though the [[Type 97 tank (7.7 mm)|Type 97 7.7 mm]] has a low clip capacity, it can prove useful for pinning enemy units and even getting hits to down enemy planes.\n\nThe best practice for the Chi-He (and other WWII-era Japanese tanks) is to always point forward, the front armour has pre-angled sides, so angling only hurts your pre-angles and weaker side armour. It's not worth trying to get more out of the 50 mm frontal effective protection.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n* B1 bis / ter: the B1 can easily destroy the Chi-Ha when using both of its guns, but when angling only the 47 mm gun is available, meaning that the Chi-Ha can take some more hits. It is very hard to destroy the Char B1 from a distance, so get as close as possible with the ideal range being no more than 300 m. Aim at their flat hull side, turret side, hull cannon mount or the driving compartment (the near-vertical frontal armour right below the turret). Upon penetrating, the Chi-Ha's 47 mm APHE can knock out several crews, and your quick reload allows you to finish the rest off in time. However if the B1 has folded armour plates on their hull sides then it is a B1 ter, avoid shooting at its sides.\n* [[M4A3 (105)]]: This low-rank Sherman posts a huge threat to every of its opponents due to its superior armour and destructive firepower. Its armour is overall quite tough to penetrate with your small 47 mm gun, but it can be solved by careful aiming. If the M4 is within 200 m, shoot at the vertical part of its gun mantlet or its side if exposed. One penetration might not kill all the crew, however two are generally enough. If it's up close and hull down, try shooting at its gun barrel to disarm it, but one shot is not guaranteed to destroy the barrel. When the M4 is further than 400 m away, all of your shells will perform poorly at penetrating its armour, so disengage or wait until it gets closer. Remember to not get hit by it, its HEAT is able to knock the Chi-He out with ease.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The 30 mm front plate armour was vulnerable to standard anti-tank weaponry and the riveted design post a hazard to the tank crew by spalling. In 1941, work began on modernizing the design up to new industrial standards.<ref name=\"ZalogaJapaneseTank\">Zaloga Steven. ''Japanese Tanks 1939-1945'' Great Britain: Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2007</ref>\n\nThe first step in the modernizing design was to go towards a welded design rather than rivveted. The front glacis plate was also simplified into a large flat 50 mm armour plate rather than the curved one. The increased armour meant an increased weight, so the Japanese added the improved Type 100 diesel engine, capable of pumping out 240 hp to propel the tank. This new tank was accepted as the '''Type 1 Chi-He'''.<ref name=\"ZalogaJapaneseTank\">Zaloga Steven. ''Japanese Tanks 1939-1945'' Great Britain: Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2007</ref>\n\nDuring the tank's preparation for mass-production, a request by the commander of the 7th Tank Regiment calling for an improved armament on the Type 97 Chi-Ha was received by the Mitsubishi factory. With the Type 1 Chi-He still needing time to enter production levels, let alone the resources needed to manufacture completely new tanks, it was placed on hold and priority was placed on improving the Type 97. This lead to the cheaper method of adapting the Type 97 to using the Type 1 turret with the 47 mm cannon, producing to the [[Chi-Ha Kai|Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai]]. This delayed the mass-production of the Type 1 Chi-He until February 1944, resulting in only 170 tanks produced before the end of the war.<ref name=\"ZalogaChiHavsSherman\">Zaloga Steven. ''M4 Sherman vs Type 97 Chi-Ha: The Pacific 1945'' Great Britain: Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2012</ref>\n\n=== Combat usage ===\nDespite its relatively early production life over late-war Japanese tanks and its improved characteristics, the Type 1 Chi-He would see its combat life held in reserves in the Japanese home islands. They would never see use in the battlefield before Japan surrendered in August 1945.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_1_chi_he_5th_regiment Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|4_cJ1CpEatw|'''Best gun depression'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:33 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;[[Chi-He (Family)|Related Development]]\n* [[Chi-Ha (Family)]] - <small>(Predecessor)</small>\n** [[Chi-Ha Kai]]\n* [[Ho-I]] - <small>(Gun tank variant)</small>\n* [[Ka-Chi]] - <small>(Amphibious variant)</small>\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Panzer III (Family)]] - <small>(Early models)</small>\n* [[LT-38 (Family)]]\n* [[M15/42]]\n* [[Lago I]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{Japan medium tanks}}\n{{Japan premium ground vehicles}}"}}
