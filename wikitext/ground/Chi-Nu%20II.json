In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]], but was released once all the rank III Japanese tanks were available to the public in the Closed Beta Test. The Chi-Nu II is essentially the [[Chi-Nu|Chi-Nu]] body with the turret from the [[Chi-To|Chi-To]], giving the tank access to the high-power [[Type II Model II (75 mm)|Type II Model II 75 mm]].\n\nThe Chi-Nu II is a combination between two vehicles, the Type 3 Chi-Nu and the Type 4 Chi-To. It has the armour of the former, but the gun of the latter. Thus, while presenting itself as a more vulnerable body with only around 50 mm of armour, it has slightly better mobility than the Chi-To, a smaller profile, yet carries the same gun. Like the Chi-To, the Chi-Nu II should be played in a sniper-like format from a distance rather than up-close to the enemy and fighting them in close-quarters.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

It's a very well-rounded medium tank in playstyle and can be compared and played like a [[Pz.IV F2]], it can destroy anything, but anything can destroy it. But unlike the Pz.IV, reload speeds are longer in exchange for a faster turret rotation.\n\nAgainst the medium tanks, its simply getting the first shot off first as the 75 mm Type 5 cannon on the Chi-Nu could penetrate most through the front hull armour, with some levels of difficulty on the turret. Of course, for maximizing the Chi-Nu's own survival, attack from the sides and make sure the enemy is unaware of the Chi-Nu's presence.\n\nThe Chi-Nu II can face heavy tanks, but it will most likely be the 76 mm [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1 series]], which the 75 mm can easily punch through the front armour. The Chi-Nu II can still meet the British [[Churchill VII]], which is impervious to the high-penetrating 75 mm from the front, so beware if caught in a frontal engagement.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The standard tank of the time was the [[Chi-Ha|Type 97 Chi-Ha]], which has its chassis used in many expedient models to provide a bigger gun for the Japanese inventory such as the [[Chi-Ha Kai|Chi-Ha Kai]], [[Chi-He|Type 1 Chi-He]], [[Ho-I|Type 2 Ho-I]], and [[Chi-Nu|Type 3 Chi-Nu]]. Two new sophisticated tanks were also in development, the [[Chi-To|Type 4 Chi-To]] and the [[Chi-Ri II|Type 5 Chi-Ri]], both fielding the powerful Type 5 75 mm gun. However, these two tanks still needed time to iron out some design bugs, time that the Japanese did not have while being stared down by the Allied powers. To get the Type 5 gun out to their forces as fast as possible, designers sought a way to get the gun onto a vehicle as fast as possible. The solution laid on the Type 3 Chi-Nu, regarded as one of Japan's best tank since its production start date in 1943.<ref name=\"SenshaManualChiNuII\">Sun, Eun Ae. ''[WT] Type3 Chi-Nu II'' SENSHA. Blogger.com, 15 Jan. 2017. Web. 24 Jan. 2017. [http://sensha-manual.blogspot.com/2017/01/wt-type3-chi-nu-ii.html Website]</ref>\n\nThe Chi-To's prototype models had larger turrets that were different from the main production model. Instead of wasting these turrets, the Japanese decided to use them on the Chi-Nu body. In March 1945, a Chi-To prototype turret was attached onto Chi-Nu chassis #37. This upgraded Chi-Nu, along the line of the Chi-Ha's upgrade, was informally labeled the ''Chi-Nu Kai''. The design was tested on the Irago Firing Grounds on March 19th and proved itself very satisfactory in combat roles. The final design was to equip the Chi-Nu with production model Chi-To turret to increase production levels and it was to help improve Japan's armoured forces to stand up against the Allies' might. This Chi-Nu with the production Chi-To turret was known as '''Chi-Nu II'''.<ref name=\"SenshaManualChiNuII\" />\n\n===War's end===\nLike most of the Japanese late-war tanks developed and retained in the home island for the \"final defense\", the modified Chi-Nu and its counterparts never saw battle against Allied armour. Japan surrendered in September 1945, effectively ending World War II. A few Chi-Nu IIs were made before the end, but they are most likely sent to the scrap yard along with most of the other Japanese equipment with their demilitarization.<ref name=\"SenshaManualChiNuII\" />\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_3_chi_nu_75cm_type_5 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|aTqPFjW2K-o|'''The Shooting Range #177''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:32 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|oa26g25qqP4|'''Best medium tanks''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:33 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Chi-Nu]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4428-development-type-3-chi-nu-ii-crouching-tiger-en|[Devblog] Type 3 Chi-Nu II - Crouching Tiger]]\n* [[wt:en/news/4468-a-new-japanese-premium-tank-the-chi-nu-ii-is-now-available-for-purchase-en|[News] A new Japanese premium tank, the Chi-Nu II is now available for purchase]]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{Japan medium tanks}}\n{{Japan premium ground vehicles}}"}}
