In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game.

It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]] along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces Tree.\n\nThe Type 3 Chi-Nu is arguably Japan's first good medium tank with adequate protection, good firepower, and good mobility, all traits well known in the medium tank categories. The previous Japanese mediums suffer from underpowered guns or tiny caliber size, but the Chi-Nu's 75 mm gun is powerful enough to deal with its contemporaries. Play style with this medium tank can be played just like any medium tank, giving the Chi-Nu the flexibility to be part of an assault force or a flanking role to support the main assault.\n\nThe 75 mm gun on the Chi-Nu gives this tank a major firepower boost in comparison to the previous Japanese mediums. At an average fighting distance, the 75 mm can penetrate between 80 to 90 mm of armour, meaning it can fight most of the medium tanks at its battle rating, and those tanks unable to be fought from the front can be defeated from the side.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Using its good mobility and excellent gun, the Chi-Nu can hit enemies at medium/ long range from a position of cover, steadily advancing towards the enemy lines. The frontal armour is stronger than a Pz.IV F2 (same thickness, more slope), but is still weak and will not protect the Chi-Nu from most guns at BR 3.3. The side armour is particularly weak, so be careful of flank attacks.\n\nThe 75 mm gun can be more closely compared to the F-34 gun used by the T-34 when using the BR-350B round. It has high post penetration damage and just under 100 mm maximum penetration. However, no access to APCR or other high penetration rounds means the Chi-Nu is going to struggle fighting vehicles like the KV-1. These should be retreated from or flanked. Sherman tanks and T-34s may also present a problem from the front.\n\nThe Type 3 Chi-Nu has many adversaries that may be difficult to overcome, which is not helped by the tank's lacking ammo variety. The only piercing ammo available is the Type 1 APHE, which still has reasonable penetration and great explosive filler, but requires the knowledge of extremely specific weaknesses in order to take down certain foes.\n\nPretty much any heavy tank can give the Chi-Nu a run for its silver lions. The Chi-Nu cannot penetrate the [[KV-1 (L-11)]] from the front at all, and struggles against other vehicles like the [[Churchill I]] or [[Gun Carrier (3-in)]]. The Churchill Gun Carrier has a small weak spot on the front of the tank - a viewport that can penetrated and one-shot the entire vehicle - but it is very difficult to hit, not to mention extremely dangerous. These tanks can be dealt with by shooting their sides, but that is not the case with the KV-1. In order to penetrate the KV-1 with the Chi-Nu, it is required to shoot the tank in the back of the turret ring. This incredibly specific weak spot - beneath the turret bustle on the back of the tank - is the only place where the Chi-Nu can penetrate the KV-1. Thankfully, shooting here results in a one-shot.\n\nTanks like the [[M4]] Sherman and [[M4A1]] Sherman can also be difficult to deal with from the front. It is best advised to hit those tanks around from the side or at close range. Try to aim for the centre of the M4A1 Sherman's frontal plate at close-medium range, about 15-50 meters.\n\nMost [[T-34 (Family)|T-34 series]] tanks can be dealt with quite easily, but for the most part it is recommended to shoot the turret instead of the frontal plate. This plate can be tricky to deal with for the Chi-Nu, so to cut the risk of a bounce altogether it's better to just shoot the turret and incapacitate the offensive capabilities of the tank, then move in for another shot.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This came to attention when their contact in Germany gave them information on the new Allied tanks like the American [[M4|M4 Sherman]]. A tank able to fight these newer machines was needed, but development takes time and resources that the IJA tank industry do not have a surplus of. Eventually, an expedient was ordered as a dedicated new design was developed.<ref name=\"ZalogaJapaneseTank\" /><ref name=\"MaiChiNu\" /> The expedient was to use a modified Type 90 75 mm field gun, a gun already proven to be effective against Allied tanks during the Philippines campaign, by adapting the gun into the [[Type 3 (75 mm)]] in models I and II<ref name=\"MaiChiNu\" />. The model I went onto the [[Ho-Ni III|Type 1 Ho-Ni III]] and the model II went to the tank design.\n\nThe concept of the tank was made in 1943, but development would not start until May 1944. It was based off a modified [[Chi-He|Type 1 medium]] tank chassis, with the only major change being a larger turret ring to accommodate the initial turret design of the [[Chi-Ri II|Chi-Ri I]] prototype.<ref name=\"MaiChiNu\" /> This expedient was accepted and designated the '''Type 3 Chi-Nu'''. The tank was to begin production in September 1944, but the escalation of American bombing of the Japanese homeland from late 1944 onwards caused massive destruction of the already-weak Japanese industry. Thus by the end of the war, between 144<ref name=\"ZalogaJapaneseTank\" /> to 166<ref name=\"MaiChiNu\" /> Type 3 Chi-Nu tanks were produced.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThough the Type 3 Chi-Nu were one of the more powerful tanks churned out of Japan's production lines in World War II, the produced Type 3 Chi-Nu were not sent out to reinforce Japanese forces on the Pacific islands. Instead, they were retained on the home islands as reserves for the defense of Japan against a possible Allied invasion of Japan.<ref name=\"MaiChiNu\" /> However, with the Allied decision to bomb Japan with nuclear weapons and a massive Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Japan surrendered before their homeland was invaded, and with this means the Type 3 Chi-Nu never saw combat in World War II. Many of the tanks were decommissioned with the demilitarization of Japan and were scrapped by the American occupation forces.<ref name=\"MaiChiNu\" /> Currently, the only surviving Type 3 Chi-Nu remains at the JGSDF Military Ordnance Training School.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_3_chi_nu Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"150px\">\nChi-Nu WebsiteImage 1.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|O-NvSFl8GaE|'''Chi-Nu - Tank Review''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4335-development-type-3-chi-nu-last-line-of-defense-en|[Devblog] Type 3 Chi-Nu: Last Line of Defense]]\n\n=== References ===\n<references>\n<ref name=\"MaiChiNu\">Sun, Eun Ae.
