In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (or just '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]] along with the rest of the initial British Ground Forces Tree. Compared to its [[Churchill Mk I|predecessor]], the Mk.III has a more capable 6-pounder gun as its arsenal with its thick front armour.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Churchill III is one of the best protected tanks at its battle rating. The tank has excellent frontal armour and can bounce several shots from tanks such as the [[Pz.III J1|Panzer III]], [[T-34 (1941)|T-34]], [[M4|M4 Sherman]], and even the dreaded [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV F2]] if angled. However, the Churchill III has its limits.  From the sides, the engine is easily damaged. The tank is also quite large and long and is a common target for bombers. Also, the sloped front part of the front armour is also weak, so the hull will need to be angled to be effective. It also has a machine gun weak spot on front. Some people do find their way around the armour and decide to shoot the turret or the turret ring. The lower glacis can sometimes be penetrated, but angling the tank can avoid that. Also, along with the [[Gun Carrier (3-in)]], it has thin roof armour and can easily be penetrated by rockets.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Driver view port, Machine gun area, Gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This tank, due to its excellent armour and gun, can even hold off an entire enemy flank with minimal backup.\n\nIn city maps, be careful not to expose the side armour as it is quite weak and the engine might get damaged. With its good gun, it can be as a support tank as well, in the second line destroying tanks. Angle the hull armour to maximize its effectiveness. When frontally angled, even the sides will be tough to penetrate.\n\nThere are some tanks that the Churchill III doesn't even need to worry about them penetrating the Churchill from the front, such as the Panzer III. Angling the armour will make the tank tough even against the high-penetration tanks like the Panzer IV F2, though these are still a big concern. When encountering these tanks with high-velocity cannons, it is advised to take cover, angle, or destroy them first. Shermans are not much threat since they won't really penetrate the Churchill armour, but sometimes they do.\n\nMost enemy tanks are easy to deal with the 57 mm gun that can punch straight through. Despite the small calibre, it can create enough post-penetration damage to one-shot medium tanks if aimed properly.\n\nOverall, the Churchill III is a very powerful Rank III vehicle that is capable of holding off an entire flank, while destroying tanks easily in quick succession. If the Churchill III is not in an up-tiered situation, it can effectively enter a battle and absorb all the enemy rounds which could've been fired at weaker teammates and either engage the enemy with the 57 mm cannon or let teammates return fire. Companion vehicles such as the [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV F2]], the [[8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl.]] and other German vehicles possess superior firepower compared to the other country vehicles in rank III (Except for other special TD's, such as the American [[M10 GMC|M10]] and British [[Achilles]]) and can in most cases hold their own.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The specification was based around the British infantry tank doctrine and with the expectation that the coming war would be based off the World War I trench warfare, thus the tank was needed to travel across unfavorable terrain and able to destroy enemy defenses and infantry obstacles. As speed and heavy firepower was not taken with priority, the vehicle was to have two 2-pounder gun on side sponson mounts with a coaxial machine gun, with another machine gun and smoke dischargers on the front hull, armour was about 60 mm on the turret. Four prototypes were made by June 1940 by Harland and Wolff. The front hull would see an upgrade in armament with a 3-inch howitzer during the prototype stages, the 43 ton tank had a 300 hp Meadows engine from the Covenanter tank and was made the tank underpowered. The A20 project was cancelled with the Battle of France, which saw the emergency evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk that left a majority of their heavy equipment behind.\n\nThe Battle of France proved that the coming World War II was not going to be a stagnant battlefield like the trench warfare from World War I. The entire concept had to be redesigned and was done so by Henry Merrit, the director of Tank Design at Woolwich Arsenal. His new concept, the '''A22''' or '''Infantry Tank Mark IV Churchill''', was given to Vauxhall Motors in June 1940. War Office requested that the A22 be ready to enter production within the year due to growing pressure of a German invasion of Britain. The designs were ready in July 1940 and the first prototypes were made by December of the same year, production soon followed in June 1941. The rushed development was acknowledged in the company to being the cause of many faults and defects in the tank, but the demand by the government was so great that it must be carried out, with the expectation that the issues will be fixed during production. The Churchill tank suffered from an under-powered engine, weak armament, and mechanical issues. The weak armament from a 2-pounder was fixed with the arming of a 6-pounder on the Churchill, but the other issues caused poor performance of the Churchill in the battlefield. In fact, the Churchill production was almost cancelled in favor of the [[Cromwell V|Cromwell]] due to its issues, but its usage in the Second Battle of El Alamein proved its value and kept it in service.\n\nThe Churchill would carry on the rest of the war as one of the most versatile tank design in British service, serving in many specialist roles other than its tank role. Altogether, a total of 7,568 Churchill units produced from 1941 to 1945, with 5,968 as tanks.\n\n===Variants===\nThe Churchill, used in a multitude of roles, is made into many different variants. 12 different kinds of tank variants were produced for combat roles, with 11 more variants in specialized roles ranging from armoured personnel carrier, a bridge-layer, mine clearer, a [[Gun Carrier (3-in)]], flamethrower tank, and an armoured recovery vehicle.\n\n===Combat Usage===\nThe Churchill tank was first used in the Dieppe Raid in August 1942. While it was really a test on how an opposed landing would work, the 60 Churchill tanks to support the Canadian units suffered from mechanical issues, and those that did work are not able to penetrate past the sea wall due to impassable defenses. None of the Churchill tanks that landed returned from the beaches and with a 70% casualty rate, the raid's attempt to establish a beachhead was a failure.\n\nThe next use of the Churchill was in North Africa during the Second Battle of El Alamein. At this point, the Churchills have been upgraded to the '''Mk.III''' variants with 6-pounders as their main armament. The detachment, code named \"King Force\", help supported the 7th Motor Brigade in their attack. The Churchills were fired upon by many German anti-tank weapons, but none were taken out with only one receiving note worthy damage. \"King Force\", as a test bed for the feasibility of Churchills operating in the desert environment, was disbanded with the establishment of the 25th Army Tank Brigade with the Churchills to see action in February 1943 in Tunisia. In the German offensive Operation Ochsenkpf, two Churchill Mk.III from the 51st Royal Tank Regiment came across an entire German transport column that they ambushed. The end result was a loss of twelve artillery pieces, 25 wheeled vehicles, two [[Pz.III J|Panzer III]]s and 200 casualties on the German side with no losses for the British. The Churchill also played a key role in the Battle of Longstop Hill, where Churchill tanks in the 48th Royal Tank Regiment faced off with Germany's newest heavy tank [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]]. Though suffering losses, a lucky 6-pounder shot from the Churchill ended up jamming the Tiger's turret and turret ring that injured the crew, forcing them to abandon the tank. The Tiger tank was captured by the British for intelligence purposes on Germany's armoured forces. The Tiger Tank is named Tiger 131.\n\nAfter the North African campaign, the Churchill began to see widespread usage in the British army as a support unit for the infantry. The Churchill saw much more operation hours than any other British tank in service. It was at this point that the Churchill Mk.III began conversion into the 75 mm guns that were used on the American [[M4|M4 Sherman]] tanks. These conversions, known as ''NA75'', proved to be more efficient than the Shermans and were used more effectively. Some Churchills were also converted into close support vehicles with 95 mm howitzers as their main armaments. In response to the growing German anti-tank firepower in the later years of World War II, the Churchill tanks were also upgraded in armour by a large degree, though their engines were also upgraded to compensate for the additional weight. The [[Churchill Mk VII|Churchill Mk.VII]], for example, has armour ranging up to 152 mm thick in the front, in comparison to the Mk.III 89 mm thick front hull. The Churchills also saw service in Europe during Operation Overlord. At the time, it was considered that the Churchill would become severely outdated with the growing tank technology, so an experimental program under specification A43, otherwise known as the [[Black Prince|Black Prince]], to up armour and up gun the Churchill. While this experiment seem fruitful, the development of more agile tanks with the same level of protection and armament such as the [[Centurion Mk 3|Centurion]] rendered the project obsolete.\n\nThe Churchill was also given out to the Allies to help combat the Axis forces. The Australian Army received a handful of Churchills for testing alongside the M4 Sherman with the Matilda II as the basis, to which proved that the Churchill was superior in jungle warfare. Of the 510 Churchills ordered by the Australians in the war, only 46 arrived in time and were not used in the Pacific War, the rest were cancelled with the end of World War II. The USSR also used the Churchills given by the British as part of the Lend-Lease act. 301 Churchills were sent, but 43 were lost to the sea by German naval forces. Of those that arrived, the Soviets gave the Churchills to the 5th Guards Tank Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka during the Kursk Offensive.\n\nAfter World War II, the Churchill stuck around in the British Army until the Korean War, when the British sent the Churchill Crocodile Squadron (C squadron of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment) to Korea to fight with the Allied coalition. They fought as gun tanks in battles such as the Third Battle of Seoul. The Churchills were instrumental in some victories and were widely praised by both British and American forces and historians. After the Korean war, the Churchills remains in combat service until 1952, with the specialized bridge-layer variant staying until the 1970s. The Irish Army also received three Churchill tanks in 1948 and another in 1949 as rentals until 1954, when they were purchased after trials with the vehicles. Despite running out of spare parts for the Churchill, the Irish Army took them in and experimented with using different engines to keep them functional, though this ended with a failure and by 1967, only one was still functional. All were retired in 1969 and one was preserved at the Curragh Camp.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_a_22b_mk_3_churchill_1942 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|gR3JPNt0iPw|'''Heavyweight brits''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:06 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|gxIVvUZGptw|'''The Shooting Range #51''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:14 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|UMCGzhRFKzc|'''The Shooting Range #42''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 02:53 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/845/|[Devblog] A22B Сhurchill Mk.III and A22 Churchill Mk.VII (with developers answers)]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Vauxhall}}\n{{Britain heavy tanks}}"}}
