{"title":"Concept 3","pageid":15449,"wikitext":{"*":"{{Specs-Card\n|code=uk_concept3_ngac\n|images={{Specs-Card-Image|GarageImage_{{PAGENAME}}.jpg}}\n}}\n\n== Description ==\n<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Red Skies\"]]. The Concept 3 is the prototype of the [[Rooikat (Family)|Rooikat family]]. The Concept 3 introduces players to the playstyle, tactics, and pros and cons of the production Rooikats to come as it is itself a Rooikat.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nLike the American [[M18 GMC|M18 Hellcat]], the Concept 3 only has 12.7 mm (0.5 in) of armour in most areas, with some areas being only 6.5 mm. As a result, anything at this BR can penetrate this vehicle's armour. Compounding issues, the Concept 3 has ammunition storage scattered all throughout its body. In other words: while incoming fire from the sides is somewhat prone to overpenetration, this cannot be depended upon. Try to avoid being shot at in the first place.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola)\n* Wheel (tires)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !!

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|OQF Mk.II (77 mm)}}\n\nDue to highly mobile playstyle, one might try to fight on the move or to attack by driving uphill to suddenly shoot enemies. Unfortunately, the gun is not stabilized and the gun elevation speed is extremely slow, which leads to the significant uncontrollable \"rocking\" of the gun, inevitably pushing it down into the ground. This makes fighting on the move in RB/SB very difficult to the point of impossible. Thus, one should always wait until the gun has settled, or drive over completely flat terrain and slow down before firing to try one's luck.\n\nIn AB, the rocking can be countered by maxing out \"targeting\" and \"leadership\", gaining at least \"expert\" crew qualification and getting all of the tank modifications. The gun will still shake a bit and fail when the car is moving over hills, but the gunner will try his best to stop this.\n\nThe gun also has a very powerful recoil, which slows the car down and can throw it around if fired broadside. It's generally not fatal, but it can be extremely annoying when firing to the side off slopes, because it will move the car and ruin the aim by pushing the car above the gun depression threshold.\n\nDue to the low weight of the car, any enemy can ram the Concept 3 to prevent it from firing. Melee combat with tanks is possible, but going literally into their face is not recommended.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[OQF Mk.II (77 mm)|77 mm OQF Mk.II]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Concept 3 will be the first Rooikat that a player unlocks, and tactics learnt from the Concept 3 would be used again in the production models of the Rooikat. One should consider its large size. This vehicle is extremely large for a scout vehicle, beating the size of a T-34 and a Sherman to some extent. Thus, concealing the Concept 3 is not an option as it will be visible from a mile away (both figuratively and literally). Thus, a Concept 3 driver must rely on its mobility.\n\nAs with all Rooikats, the Concept 3 boasts extremely good mobility. So, the main tactic for the Concept 3 is to zoom fast to a good position, fire until you are satisfied or are under fire, before relocating to another location as quickly as possible. Rooikats are simply good at running. One should prioritize positions that allow an easy escape, such as near a large stack of rocks or a gentle hill. This is also helped by the Concept 3's decent depression angle of -10°. Use it! Apart from that, try to find positions where one can fire at the flanks of an enemy.\n\nThis extreme mobility and size comes at a very large cost. The Concept 3 has next to no armour, only being able to resist rifle calibre rounds. Everything else will penetrate it with ease, but some parts of the armour are still thick enough to activate an APHE's fuse. Thus, it is recommended to always ensure minimal risk of being shot at, let alone hit.\n\nTo sum it up: be mobile and fast, find good sniping spots, but never stay in one place. If one was to find themselves being shot at, quickly relocate or hide. As the name suggests, one must hunt like ''Een Afrikaan Rooikat'', an African Caracal. Play it smart, play it fast.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It was designed to fulfil a new South African requirement for a \"New Generation Armoured Car\". The project started in 1976 and ended in 1979. 3 testbed vehicles were made, Concept 3 being one of them. The Concept 3 differed from the Alvis Saracen APCs - it had an 8-wheel configuration, giving it superior off-road characteristics and superior performance. The Concept 3 was fitted with a [[OQF Mk.II (77 mm)|77mm OQF Mk.II]], identical to the one found on the [[Comet I|A34 Comet I]] which, while underwhelming for the time was merely a placeholder and was later swapped for a [[Royal Ordnance L7A1 (105 mm)|105 mm Royal Ordnance L7]] which was a licence built version of the same gun found on the British [[Centurion Mk 10]]. The L7 variant was known as the \"Bismarck\". The vehicle was built by South African company Sandock-Austral (later merged into BAE Systems), the same company credited with creating and producing the Ratel family ([[Ratel 20]] / [[Ratel 90|90]]) and the [[Eland 90 Mk.7]]. Several tests were conducted over the years at Potchefstroom, South Africa. The Concept 3 series was nicknamed the \"Cheetah\" and the vehicle was officially designated \"Concept 3, Class 2B\" and was built to slightly different medium specifications, raising the original weight of the vehicle from a modest 17 tonnes to a rather considerable weight of up to 23 tonnes.\n\nWhen all is said and done, the Concept series deviated from the original vision of the Armoured Personnel Carrier, morphing into a light Armoured Fighting Vehicle or reconnaissance car. The original intended role of Armoured Personnel Carrier was ultimately fulfilled by the excellent Ratel family which doubled as an effective Infantry Fighting Vehicle. Therefore the South African National Defence Force ultimately cancelled the order for the Concepts, and immediate further development of the Concept programme was promptly terminated.\n\nHowever, the legacy of the Concept cannot be asserted enough: the basic design of the Concept and in particular its chassis would later become that of the Rooikat family ([[Rooikat 105]] / [[Rooikat MTTD|MTTD]] / [[Rooikat Mk.1D|Mk.1D]] / [[ZA-35]]) which are still used to this day. The Concept, while often forgotten, disregarded and dishonoured is perhaps one of the most - if not the most - influential military vehicle design in South African history.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_concept3_ngac Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|GSSJKUqU3WE|'''The Shooting Range #260''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:28 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related developement\n\n* [[Rooikat Mk.1D]]\n* [[Rooikat 105]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{Britain light tanks}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
