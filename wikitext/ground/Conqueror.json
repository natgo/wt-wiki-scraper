In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]] along with the initial British ground tree. Designed to combat the Soviet [[IS-3]], the Conqueror gives the British line a much-needed vehicle with an emphasis on armour and firepower, with a [[M58 (120 mm)|120 mm L1A2 cannon]] capable of defeating all of the Rank V competition it will face.\n\nThe Conqueror was the tank the [[Caernarvon]] hull was designed for - the Caernarvon itself only being a stop-gap measure, with most models being upgraded to Conquerors once the type was approved for production. The Conqueror augments this hull with a significantly upgraded turret design housing the L1A2 120mm cannon.\n\nThe Conqueror deviates from most earlier British designs, favouring firepower and armour. This, combined with its somewhat limited mobility, results in the Conqueror proving to be one of, if not the single most effective sniper and support tank at its rank. Despite this, it can be put to good use in close-range engagements.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n[[File:Conqueror trapshot mantlet .png|thumb|400x400px|A basic weak spot of the Conqueror; the gun mantlet. The area is hit because of Conqueror's poor depression. It can be targeted by large-calibre HE, APDS and Sabot shells. -''The shown camouflage is known as 'Phalanx', part of the 'Night vision' trophy.'']]\nThe Conqueror utilises the same hull as the Caernarvon does, with respectable frontal armour capable of shrugging off rounds from many adversaries. Unfortunately, this hull suffers from similarly weak side and rear armour - and as such angling, the vehicle can prove extremely dangerous if it exposes the side too much. The Conqueror replaces the Caernarvon's Centurion-based turret with a fresh design, providing much better crew spacing and protection. The turret is not without its weaknesses, however; the commander's cupola protrudes quite significantly and APHE or HESH shells may disable internal turret components or crew members. There is also a weak section directly behind the mantlet at the top of the turret, penetration of which will disable crew or the breech/horizontal turret drive.\nTrap shots are possible, it is likely to get shot with a high calibre HE, capable of damaging the tank by hitting the base of the turret and exploding into the driver and/or ammo rack just below it. Unlike with similar tank [[M103]] though, for most heavy tanks HE can only penetrate the driver hatch, taking them out, and damage the gun breech on a good hit. SPG calibre HE (like 152 mm of [[Object 268]]) will definitely destroy the roof armour and ammo rack, resulting in a one-shot, unless only a few shells are being carried (which is highly impractical). Non-HE shells are less likely to ricochet and do significant internal damage like this, but it is still possible to push them into the tank.\n\nThe frontal track guards are also very vulnerable at particular angles and can be exploited even when sides are not exposed to instantly destroy the tank using nearly any gun, like with [[Churchill Mk VII]]. The more realistic scenario, however, is high calibre HESH hitting the ground next to them and setting the tank on fire or outright destroying it. Fortunately, most tanks which are capable of this and are going out of their way to use HESH instead of HEAT are British and can only be your opponent in AB, in RB the likelihood of receiving such hit is greatly reduced.\n\nThe Conqueror has a researchable add-on armour package which improves the vehicle's survivability to HEAT rounds and by a small amount to kinetic rounds.<ref name=\"dtic\" />\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret)\n* Structural steel (Side skirts)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It does suffer from a somewhat limited top speed of 34 km/h, however it reaches this speed fairly easily on-road and on smooth off-road surfaces. The vehicle has surprisingly responsive hull traverse due to the engine power and neutral steering capability. The {{PAGENAME}} has a reasonable reverse speed for a British vehicle, however it shouldn't be relied on too heavily.\n\nWhen the add-on armour package is researched and equipped, the vehicle's weight will increase by 1.1 tonnes, resulting in a minor decrease in mobility.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

L1A2 (120 mm)}}\n\nThe 120 mm L1A2 is a powerful gun, derived from the M58 mounted on the M103 heavy tank. Unlike the M103's selection of HEAT or AP, the Conqueror instead utilises HESH and APDS ammunition, and again unlike the M103, mounts a two-plane stabiliser. The L1A2 exhibits excellent accuracy and long-range performance, although due to the sub-par post-penetration effects of APDS in some cases multiple rounds are required to secure a knock-out, particularly at range where critical components or ammunition is less reliably hit.\n\nDespite this, the Conqueror performs admirably as a sniper, covering capture points or thoroughfares, and should primarily rely on APDS with careful thought as to placement. HESH may prove useful against lighter vehicles or in cases where a target's side armour is exposed, but otherwise should not be relied on for anything besides pure luck. It's important to remember that the Conqueror has a reasonably long reload of 19.4 seconds at base; and as such careful consideration should be made as to what to prioritise disabling first.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Ordnance QF Tk.

This heavy tank should not be played in a brawling role. It will easily be flanked and disposed by the side armour plates. Commanders are advised to remain on some of these roles:\n\n'''Sniper Role'''\n\nWhen used in a sniper role, the Conqueror should utilise extreme ranges with some form of cover available, in case the situation goes awry. Ensure awareness is maintained for light flanking vehicles or enemy sniping vehicles on off-angles that may be able to disable the Conqueror through side armour. Play conservatively, avoiding wasting shots, having to wait for the long reload time, and avoid exposing the hull where possible.\n\nRemember the rangefinder and if possible find locations that cover the hull of the Conqueror.\n\n'''Breakthrough Role'''\n\nThe Conqueror may be utilised in a breakthrough role, although it should be played conservatively with allies and with a level of map awareness at all times. The stabilised gun allows the conqueror to comfortably fire on the move - a rare piece of equipment at the rank - this gives it a distinct advantage over most targets it will face at close range, with the ability to reliably hit targets without waiting for the suspension sway to subside. However, the vehicle's slow reload means that calculated shots are a requirement, and wasting any round may have dire results.\n\nAs usual, keep in mind that the vehicle's sides and lower front plate are particularly vulnerable and exposing either to enemy fire will often result in the Conqueror's destruction. If the advance seems to be failing, or the Conqueror is on risk to be flanked. Remember the good reverse speed, this along smoke cover will grant second chances.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n===Development===\nIn 1944, General Staff started a project called ''A45 Infantry Support Tank'', which started around the same time as the development of the [[Centurion Mk 1|A41 Centurion]] cruiser tank. This project, after the war, was redesignated from a typical \"Infantry Tank\" and instead focused on a new role of a \"Universal Tank\" design in the form of the FV 200 series. The \"Universal Tank\" concept was to design a vehicle that would have a mobility comparable to that of cruiser tanks, but with the armour and firepower of heavy tanks. The FV 200 series designation was adopted and was to serve as a line of vehicles that used the same hull and chassis in different roles like armour recovery vehicles and self-propelled guns. The first tank of this series was to be the FV 201, which would be 55 tons and use the 20-pounder gun.\n\nIn 1949, a new requirement for the project called for the use of a 120 mm gun, possibly in response to the reveal of the Soviet [[IS-3]] heavy tank in the Berlin Victory Parade in 1945. This new requirement would delay the initial deadlines for the tank as no gun of that caliber had been developed yet. As a interim development before such a gun could be made, the FV 201 hull was mounted with a turret from the Centurion tank and this created the ''[[Caernarvon|FV 221 Caernarvon]]'', with ''Mark I'' for a 17-pounder armament and a ''Mark II'' for a 20-pounder armament. However, the success of the lighter Centurion tank made the Caernarvon unsuitable in a \"Main Battle Tank\" role. Further development on the Caernarvon, with emphasis on the armour and armament, would develop the '''FV 214 Conqueror''' tanks, some were straight up conversions of Caernarvon Mark II's. About 185 Conquerors were produced in Mk.1 and Mk.2 variants from 1955 to 1959.\n\n===Design===\nThe FV 214 Conqueror, also known as the \"Tank, Heavy No. 1, 120 mm Gun, Conqueror\", was intended to provide a mobile, long-range anti-tank support for the lighter and more numerous Centurion tanks stationed in Germany. As a response to the heavy [[IS-3]] tank in Soviet service, the tank's armament and armour is taken up and beyond extreme to typical NATO armour development. The armour, with a frontal plate of about seven inches (178 mm), made the tank one of the most protected tanks stationed in West Germany. The abundance of armour made the tank heavy, weighing 64 tons, and this impeded the tank's top speed and made it mechanically unreliable. However, the tank was very mobile in cross-country terrain, seen as equal as the lighter and faster Centurion tank.\n\nThe gun was the very large 120 mm cannon, the largest caliber tank gun available when it was introduced. The gun was American-developed, the same 120 mm cannon that would arm the [[M103|M103]] heavy tank. The gun uses a two-piece ammunition and the tank allowed for a ammo stowage of 35 rounds. Another notable feature of the Conqueror aside from its large cannon and thick armour was the unique and rotatable commander's cupola. In the cupola was the Conqueror's fire control system and had many features that made it ahead of its time. Being able to be rotated independent from the turret, plus with a coincidence rangefinder, the commander could align the cupola to a target, measure its range, and direct the gunner to the designated target. While the gunner located and engage the target, the commander could go and find a different target to designate and range.\n\n===Usage===\nThe Conqueror were all stationed in West German in the armoured regiments stationed there. Each regiment received 9 Conquerors and were organized in groups of three as tank troops to support the Centurions in any conflict that arise from the tense situation of the Cold War. As history played out, the Cold War never became \"hot\" and no hostile conflicts arise in the borders of Germany, thus the Conquerors never saw any use aside from training as they were all exclusively stationed on the German borders. The Conqueror's intention to provide a long-range anti-tank capability for the Centurions, became less significant when the Centurions began to arm themselves with the more powerful 105 mm L7 gun, such as the [[Centurion Mk 10]]. The lower tactical value of the Conqueror and further development on heavy tanks in Britain had the Conquerors replaced in 1966 with the much more powerful and armoured, yet lighter, [[Chieftain Mk 3|FV 4201 Chieftain tank]].\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=britain&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=heavy_tank&vehicle=uk_conqueror_mk_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|gR3JPNt0iPw|'''Heavyweight brits''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 6:21 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|94S5XQwnX2I|'''The Shooting Range #108''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:28 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|JmaDhygkvDg|'''Tank Chats #145 <nowiki>| Conqueror |</nowiki> The Tank Museum''' - ''The Tank Museum''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n'''Analogues of other nations'''\n\n* [[IS-7]]\n* [[IS-4M]]\n* [[T-10M]] /  [[T-10A]]\n* [[M103]]\n\n'''Related Development'''\n\n* [[Caernarvon]]\n* [[Conway]]\n\n'''Shared operational history'''\n\n* [[Centurion Mk 10]]\n* [[Caernarvon]]\n\n'''Succeeded by'''\n\n* [[Chieftain Mk 3]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the tank;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/850/|[Devblog] Сenturion Mk III and Conqueror Mk II]]\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/870|[Devblog] Conqueror Armor Investigation]]\n\n== References ==\n<references>\n<ref name=\"dtic\">[https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a474293.pdf Trials against Conqueror tanks with additional ballistic protection - Part 2 The use of large hollow charge warheads.pdf]</ref>\n</references>\n\n{{Britain heavy tanks}}"}}
