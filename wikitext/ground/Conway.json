In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 \"Battle March\"]]. It is armed with a cannon developed to take on the heavy Soviet [[IS-3]] tank. It excels in fighting the top-rank heavies.\n\nThe Conway plays very similarly to the [[KV-2 (1939)|KV-2]]. It has sub-par armour on all sides and has a very large-calibre gun, able to penetrate everything it faces, severely damaging most. It can be played as an usual tank destroyer, excelling at it with its high velocity APDS rounds, sniping from a distance.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

In this case, you should check the battle rating of opposing team. Despite having heavy gun, your best bet in uptier would be long range flank sniping. This is due to APDS doing less damage to crew and components, the thicker the armour it penetrated was, thus doing minimal damage through heavy tank's frontal armour. As such, you are less dangerous to superheavy tanks (especially the ones from 8.0) from front, compared to [[FV4005|FV 4005]], which many players will mistake you for. You still can penetrate most of breakthrough tanks, forcing them to retreat or slip up at critical moment. Since APDS is super high velocity, you can snipe across the map with little issue, and do fatal damage from sides.\n\nTo everything else you are extremely dangerous, and, if detected, have some presence factor. This can be beneficial and bad at same time, since you can scare off heavy tanks and attract medium and light tanks, and even other SPGs. Your turret might hold off a few stray shots from distant or weak opponents, but your hull is still quite fragile, and reload times are still too long, so there is no room for mistakes at close range duels. For these reasons, if possible, adversaries must be kept away from you, so their guns are inadequate at fighting you, your hull must be kept hidden, and enemy SPG and \"sniper\" oriented medium tanks must be neutralized on sight.\n\nIn case a light vehicle is stalking you, it's better to just load HESH, provoke the enemy, then hopefully blast them away. Heavily-armoured vehicles are still more vulnerable to APDS than HESH regardless of range, unless you hit them at specific weak spots with it.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The IS-3 tank showed the Western Allies needed to reconsider their tank inventories, which at the time the IS-3 was introduced only composed of mostly [[M4A3 (76) W|M4 Sherman]], [[M26]] Pershing, and Centurions. The British, recognizing the need for a bigger gun to fight the IS-3, started producing the [[Conqueror]]. However, development takes time and the Conqueror would not be ready until 1955. As an interim project until it is done, the British took a [[Centurion Mk 3]] tank and upgraded with a new turret made from rolled plate that can mount the 120 mm L1 gun, the same gun meant for the Conqueror. This vehicle, designated the FV4004 Conway was to have the heavy armament, yet the same manoeuvrability as the base Centurion. One of such vehicle was made in this matter before the whole thing was cancelled in 1951. The sole piece made is now stored at the Bovington Tank Museum.\n\nAnother attempt at this kind of mounting with the Centurion was the [[FV4005]], which was meant to be a tank destroyer with a larger 183 mm gun. The project started in 1951 and developed in July 1955. The gun was mounted in a similar fashion as the Conway on a lightly armoured turret. This was a limited production and by August 1957, the whole project was disassembled. The FV4005 also has survived in the Bovington Tank Museum.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_fv4004_conway Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|q-HxA831aUk|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/872/|[Devblog] FV4004 Conway: IS Hunter]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Centurion_(tank)#Fighting_Vehicle_numbers|[Wikipedia] Centurion (tank) - Fighting Vehicle numbers]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Department of Tank Design}}\n{{Britain tank destroyers}}"}}
