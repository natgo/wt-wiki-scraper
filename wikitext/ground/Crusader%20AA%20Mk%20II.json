If such an encounter occurs, get out of the vicinity and do not draw the attention of tanks like the [[T-34-57]] or [[Tiger H1|Tiger]] will one shot this SPAA. When shooting planes try to aim for bombers and ground attack planes as they won't be able to outmanoeuvre the shots.\n* APT rounds gives a lot more choices. Though it is a Rank 3 vehicle, the low battle rating means it will be matched against Rank 2 opponents, many of which won't stand a chance if shot from the sides with APT. If in a higher rank battle (with opponents like the [[Panther D]] and the [[IS-1]]), this tactic will often not work. However, the Mark II can still tear apart tracks and gun barrels just as easily with the APT rounds.\n* As for the default belt, it is probably better off changing to prioritize HET or APT.\n\nDue to the relatively low ammo reserve, only take one type of belt with you and take as much you can carry as the ammo will run out quickly when it is split apart for both belts.\n\nDue to the closed nature of the vehicle, the Crusader AA Mk.II doesn't need to worry about strafing fighters as they will often not do any serious damage to the crew. However, ground attackers like the [[IL-2 (Family)|IL-2]] or the [[P-47 (Family)|P-47]] are still just as deadly. Though more protected from machine gun fire, its armour is not enough to stand against enemy tanks, which would slice through the armour with shots from their cannons.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

One of these designs was the designation Tank, Cruiser Mk.V based off the [[A13 Mk I|A13 cruiser tanks]], named the \"Covenanter\", and Nuffield was invited to become part of its development team, but they refused due to interest in developing their own cruiser tank. Their tank was designated the '''Tank, Cruiser Mk.VI Crusader''' and fell under the General Staff specification of A15. The Crusader was a parallel design to the Covenanter but was ready six weeks earlier than the Covenanter despite starting at a later time. The Crusader was adopted into service with the British Army in 1941 and the 5,300 units were manufactured between 1940 to 1943.\n\n===Design===\nThe Crusader features a new design that differs from its cruiser tank predecessors. The Christie suspension system on the Crusader had five road wheels for it instead of the usual four, which improves weight distribution of the increased 20-ton weight of the Crusader compared to the 14 tons of the A13 cruisers. The engine, steering system, and cooling system on the Crusader was different as well, but the Covenanter and Crusader use the same main turret. The polygonal shape of the turret gives the crew inside more room for the turret ring diameter.\n\nThe Crusader Mk.I and [[Crusader Mk II|Mk.II]] were equipped with the 2-pounder, which was aimed by the gunner inside with a padded shaft that allows them to elevate the gun by simply adjusting his own height. Later in the war where an up-gun of the tank armament was necessary and newer tanks such as the [[Cromwell V|Cromwell]] was delayed, the Crusader was upgraded into the [[Crusader Mk III]] variant with a 6-pounder instead, which restricted turret space, requiring the turret crew to be reduced from three to two. These saw the first action the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe Crusader first saw action at North Africa, right after the British had been pushed back to the Egyptian border by Axis forces. The Crusaders were part of the huge shipment in the Malta Convoys to reequip the British forces there. Enough Crusaders arrive that the entire 6th Royal Tank Regiment was refitted with them, which joined up with the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment to form the 7th Armoured Brigade \"Desert Rats\". The brigade's first action was in Operation Battleaxe, though it was delayed due to adapting the tanks for the desert environment. The operation, which called for the relieve of the siege of Tobruk in June, was initiated in June to which 11 Crusader tanks were lost to anti-tank guns, plus many more to mechanical faults. While more Crusader tanks came in to reinforce the cruiser tank forces, there were never enough to supply the continuously expanding armoured units as 7th Brigade was combined with the 7th Hussars, the 2nd Armoured Brigade was added to the 7th Armoured Division, and the 8th Hussars was combined with the 4th Armoured Brigade. Overall, the Crusaders proved effective in the North African Campaign, the Crusader was faster than any tanks on the opposing side and the 2-pounder was lethal to the [[Pz.III J|Panzer III]], but the tank suffered from its thin armour, mechanical problems in the desert, and the growing deficiency of the 2-pounder, which didn't have enough range to destroy farther tanks. The Crusader design also caused the ammo racks on the tank to easily ignite due to unprotected racks and shot traps on the turret design. Anti-tank guns continue to be the main reason the Crusader units suffer losses, rather than to enemy tanks.\n\nBy the end of 1941, only the 2nd Armoured Brigade retained the Crusaders, the rest of the other tank units were being refitted with better tanks, such as the [[Grant I|M3 Grant medium tank]] from the American Lend-Lease. Crusader units were also refitted with the more powerful Crusader Mk.III with the 6-pounder, which improved the Crusader's ability to destroy the gradually stronger German tanks. After General Bernard Montgomery took command of the British Army in 1942, more British tank units were re-equipped with the Grant and [[M4|M4 Sherman]] tanks while the Crusaders were relegated from the front-lines to \"light squadrons\" meant to flank the enemy and attacked at its exposed sides. When the British 1st Army engaged the Axis at Tunisia, some tank regiments still use Crusaders mixed in with [[Valentine Mk I|Valentine tanks]]. These units in the 26th Armoured Brigade, code-named \"Blade Force\", worked alongside the 78th Infantry Division as an independent armoured column. During Tunisia, the 1st Army was already converting the tank regiments into Shermans, but the 8th Army continued to use the Crusaders for much longer, which would see use at the Battle of Wadi Akarit and Mareth Line.\n\nAfter the North African Campaign, the Crusaders no longer saw any use in the front-lines and were used in other roles such as gun tractors with 17-pounders or anti-aircraft mounts such as the '''[[Crusader AA Mk I|Crusader AA Mk.I]]''' and [[Crusader AA Mk II|Mk.II]] Some Crusader tanks equipped the tank regiments that stayed back at the British Homelands such as the 11th Armoured Division.\n\nThe AA tank Mark II replaced the obsolete Mark VI AA tanks that had been in the four-vehicle anti-aircraft troop in a British armoured regiment or infantry tank battalion, starting with the Normandy landings. The lack of German air targets meant they were largely used against ground targets. These regimental AA troops in France in 1944 used a mix of Crusader Mark IIs, Crusader AA Mk IIIs (which had a coaxial machine gun as well), and similarly armed Centaur AA tanks (based on an early version of the Cromwell that was also no longer useful as a battle tank).\n\n===Survivors===\nAbout 21 Crusaders still exist intact in various parts of the world. The most notable places with the Crusaders are South Africa with 8 known survivors, a running [[Crusader Mk III]] at Bovington Tank Museum at England, and an anti-aircraft version at Musée des Blindés in France.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_crusader_aa_mk_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Crusader AA Mk II night fury.jpg|A night shot of the {{PAGENAME}} firing its cannons.\nFile:Crusader AA Mk II after shooting down a Ju-87.jpg|A Crusader shortly after shooting down a [[Ju 87 (Family)|Ju 87]].\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/855/|[Devblog] Crusader AA Mk.I and Crusader AA Mk.II]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Nuffield}}\n{{Britain anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
