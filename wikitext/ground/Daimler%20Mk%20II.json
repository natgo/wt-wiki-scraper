In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.71 \"New E.R.A.\"]].\n\nA [[QF 2-pounder (40 mm)|QF 2-pounder]] on 4x4 wheels. This vehicle is made to support infantry in a way similar to the cavalry. It is not made to withstand heavy fire. Notably, its wheeled configuration means the car will not get good fire when on the move and it will turn in an arc. Meanwhile, its good reverse speed could possibly save the car as long as the move happens before the enemy shoots.\n\nThe Daimler is recognisable from other armoured cars by its hexagonal hull centre and its short length. It has 4 mm boxes scattered across the hull and a spare tire on the left side. Besides the main armament, it is equipped with a coaxial BESA machine gun (same MG as higher rank British vehicles), a decent gun to shower open-topped SPGs with lead.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nDaimler's survivability against enemy impacts is very low. The crew is tightly placed inside the vehicle. The armour plates only provide significant cover against machine guns fire. 20 mm calibre or higher will be able to pierce the armoured car. Having both thin armour and a small crew, the Daimler cannot sustain heavy enemy fire. The Daimler might survive if the enemy shell hits lower the combat compartment, often damaging the transmission but keeping the crew unscathed. The angles of the armour plates offer the possibility of ricocheting some shells, but the chances of this occurring are low.\n\nWhile the armour is weak, drivers can take advantage of the good manoeuvrability and gun to ambush enemies. The enemies to be most wary of in the Daimler is any vehicle with a rapid firing cannon. German vehicles with 20 mm cannons and most enemy AA vehicles are very dangerous for the Daimler, because their rounds will shred its armour.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=112|rbMinHp=84}}\n\nThe Daimler is very similar to other British light tanks at the tier, but with one major difference: it has wheels rather than tracks. This difference allows the Daimler to reach really good high speeds on road. Because of this, Daimler drivers should consider planning their route based on what roads are available on the map, however once engaged with the enemy, it is best to find cover rather than remain exposed on the road.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|QF 2-pounder (40 mm)}}\n\nThe 40 mm QF (quick-firing) 2-pounder is one of the best guns at the rank, and has a good selection of ammunition. The extremely high rate of fire (2.8s reload) gives the Daimler the ability to dispatch multiple enemies. This means that if the Daimler and the enemy both miss the first shot, the Daimler is likely to get in the second shot before the enemy has reloaded.\n\nThe gun penetration is remarkably good even against some rank II vehicles and rank III vehicles' side armour. However, the absence of explosive filler on the highest penetration round (unlike German, Italian, or Swedish counterparts) means the Daimler must fire 2 or more rounds against an enemy tank. Knowing when and where to fire, is vital to exploit the superior reload rate of this cannon. The gun traverse rate is one of the drawbacks to consider. Pretty similar to the previous Tetrarch. The aiming must be aided by smart use of mobility and positioning.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[QF 2-pounder (40 mm)|40 mm QF 2-pounder]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The penetration at long-ranges is also superior to all the other shells. Tank commanders are encouraged to use this shell.\n\nThe  '''Shot Mk.1 APHV/T''' (Armour piercing High velocity/ tracer) shell offers a higher muzzle velocity. This will help with the shell drop, but significant penetration is lost with distance.\n\nThe '''Shell Mk.1 AP/T''' is one of the only shells with armour-piercing and explosive capacities available for the British tanks. It works well during close quarters, but the use at long distances (500+ m) is not advised.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | '''Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)'''\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 AP/T || AP || 72 || 68 || 52 || 37 || 27 || 19\n|-\n| Shot Mk.IXB APCBC/T || APCBC || 89 || 86 || 77 || 66 || 57 || 50\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 APHV/T || AP || 80 || 75 || 58 || 41 || 30 || 21\n|-\n| Shell Mk.1 AP/T || APHE || 66 || 62 || 49 || 36 || 26 || 20\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 AP/T || AP || 792 || 1.08 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.IXB APCBC/T || APCBC || 792 || 1.24 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 APHV/T || AP || 853 || 1.08 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| Shell Mk.1 AP/T || APHE || 792 || 1.08 || 1.2 || 9 || 20.9 || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.7.0.208''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->\n{{main|BESA (7.92 mm)}}\n\nThe machine gun is present as a secondary role gun. The use of this machine gun limits significantly to vehicles with an exposed crew , like anti-air half-tracks or open trucks, [[Type 94]] for example; or SPGs with exposed rear and top like the [[Panzerjager I]].\n\nCommanders should be ready to fire with the machine gun. Because of the quickfire, the machine gun becomes a more effective way to deal with some vehicles. Whereas the main gun might pierce and cause punctual damage, with the machine gun is possible to spray the fire and finish exposed crews quicker.\n\nAnother role of this machine gun is for ''anti-air''. The turret traverse speed limits this use but is an available possibility.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[BESA (7.92 mm)|7.92 mm BESA]]\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nGenerally, the best play style for the Daimler is to '''flank''' using a road until near the enemy and then fire from cover against enemy side armour. The Daimler is capable in both short and long-range fights. At long-range make sure to use cover and wait till the enemy looks away before exposing yourself. At close range, you can use your speed to outmanoeuvre the enemy.\n\nThanks to the good mobility and decent firepower, this light car can be a highly effective flanker. There are also several roles in which the Daimler can effectively perform at:\n\n'''Brawler'''\n\nThe urban close maps require a high amount of situational awareness. The Daimler's quick-firing gun allows for this playstyle. Nonetheless, the armour doesn't. Commanders should use the mobility both forwards and backwards to wisely position the Daimler. Consider the Daimler is not a tracked vehicle (cannot turn on the spot), so it must turn in what is known as the three-point turn.\n\nOnce a good area is found (one that allows the retreat to a second position) The Daimler can remain settled or roam close the zone, along with the allied vehicles. Use hills and slopes to extend the survivability, the cannon is highly flexible due to a good vertical depression. So the Daimler can be close to combat while remaining partially hidden.\n\nThe frontal engagements should be fully avoided. Seek alternative routes or stay behind the allied tanks on the frontline.\n\n'''Supporting light tank'''\n\nThe Daimler is capable to provide quick-fire support to friendly tanks in the frontline. If impossible to penetrate an enemy tank frontally, proceed to fire at the gun's barrel, the tracks or the turret cupola. All of this will help allied tanks.\n\nThis is not the only useful aspect of this role, but commanders can become \"field mechanics\" with these light vehicles and help to repair any allied vehicle in the combat; heavy tanks can use this help greatly because they will be constantly shot and damaged. Be aware of where the fighting is and remain close, a message of allied repair request might appear.\n\nDo not forget to employ the artillery strike to tame enemy's advance in nearby areas or cap zones and release the smoke grenades when needed. All of this can be vital to help the team to win.\n\n{{Notice\n |With the Daimler consider never exposing yourself to enemy fire; be ready to retreat in reverse and with smoke cover!\n}}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Good reverse speed and acceleration.\n* Does not lose speed when turning, smooth driving\n* Decent turret traverse\n* Armour is thin enough to avoid detonating some APHE shells; some shells might pass through\n* Has smoke grenade launchers\n* Many 4 mm boxes scattered on the hull, offering compact ammo rack protection against shrapnel and machine guns\n* -12° of gun depression\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Armour is lacking overall and only three crewmen means poor survivability\n* Has no tracks, does not turn on point; limits mobility\n* Has difficulty reaching max speed off-road\n* Vulnerable to HMG, especially the tires\n* Has a tendency to tip over in sharp turns if not careful due to a high profile\n* Poor stock performance\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The Daimler was similar in design but also introduced a rear-facing wheel for the commander to use in an emergency. It carried the same turret as the Tetrarch light tank, putting it on a par with early-war British tanks.\n\nGerman bombing raids over England hampered production, however, and the vehicle did not enter combat until mid-1942; 2,694 would be built.\n\nIn the Desert Campaign, they were used by the King's Dragoon Guards and the Royal Dragoons, and by the time of the Tunisia campaign, additional armoured car regiments. In the desert, the Daimler was normally the heaviest-armed armoured car, with one in each three-car troop. After the North African campaign, armoured car troops were reorganized into 4-car troops with two Daimlers and two lighter armoured scout cars.\n\nDaimlers were also used by the 11th Cavalry in the Burma campaign. They remained in British service until 1960.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_daimler_mk_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Contemporary light tanks with similar role\n* [[AMD.35]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Daimler Company}}\n{{Britain light tanks}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
