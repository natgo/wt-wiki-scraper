Can knock out common tanks like [[Pz.IV H]], [[M4A3 (76) W|M4A3]], [[T-34-57]], etc. with a single shot\n* Has a narrow and low silhouette, easy to hide behind vegetation and cover\n* High reverse speed and smoke grenade launchers grant it excellent tactical agility, can get out of dangerous situations quickly\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Relies on roads heavily as mobility on loose surface is significantly worsened. \n* Thin armour can be penetrated by anything. Heavy MG and autocannons (e.g. [[M16 MGMC]], [[Wirbelwind]]) are more dangerous\n* Steering radius is quite large, navigation in confined environment can be awkward\n* M61 shell cannot reliably penetrate tanks like [[StuG III G]], [[T14]], [[KV-1E]]\n* Wheels are large and spread out, can get damaged easily\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
