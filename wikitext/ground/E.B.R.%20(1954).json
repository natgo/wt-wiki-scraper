In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Hot Tracks\"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/6981-special-operation-w-i-n-t-e-r-en|2020 Operation W.I.N.T.E.R.]] event.\n\nCompared to the [[E.B.R. (1951)|standard version]] in the tech tree, the {{PAGENAME}} has the turret from the [[AMX-13]], which allows players to use the longer [[SA50 L/57 (75 mm)|SA50 L/57]] cannon for enhanced firepower.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

(1954) can reach 105 km/h on roads, 60 km/h on dirt tracks and 40 km/h in cross country. Soft terrain is a handicap: mud, snow and sand will considerably slow the armoured car. As a wheeled vehicle, it can't turn on the spot but the turn radius stays relatively small thanks to front and rear steering wheels. The reverse speed is also very high, a must to get out of hot situations quickly.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe EBR can be used as a long range sniper and as a scout thanks to its good optics and fast shell speed, or it can be used as an aggressive flanking vehicle using its superior mobility and reload rate.\n\nThe EBR best preforms on the sidelines of the enemy team, using its autoloader and high velocity gun to eliminate any opposition. The lack of explosive filler for the shell makes aiming at crew positions and critical modules important, prioritizing the gun or ammo rack of the target. Thanks to the autoloader and fast turret rotation, it is easy to switch between targets on the heat of combat, and the smoke pods allow for a quick escape if the situation gets too difficult.\n\n;Enemies worth keeping\n\n* [[Tiger I (Family)|Tiger I]] and [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther I]]: Sitting at the same BR, these targets can prove to be difficult. Flanking them and shooting their weakly armoured sides is advised, but in case of a face to face encounter, shooting the right side (from the players point of view) of the Panther's mantlet or the right side of the Tiger's Hull will disable or destroy them. In case these shots are impossible or too risky, one can shoot the barrels, take a track out and relocate and target the side of said tanks.\n\n* [[T26E1-1]] \"Super Pershing\" and [[Tiger II (H)]]: At a range larger than 200 m these targets become invulnerable to the 75 mm gun, one should side shoot them or disable their guns and tracks.\n \n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Fast and very mobile vehicle\n* The main gun reloads in 5 seconds even with 2 active crew members and the autoloader has a capacity of 12 rounds.\n* The shells have a very high muzzle velocity  and, despite the lack of explosive filler, deal a lot of damage.\n* Both the front and back wheels steer, resulting in a pretty small turning radius.\n* The hull armour, in the front (and back), is enough to stop .50 cal AP fire, as well as 14.5 mm AP-I(c) from 200 meters or more; the turret front may be even able to stop some autocannon fire.\n* As this vehicle is an armoured car, scouting is available.\n* APC shell with a very high penetration of 182 mm at 10 m, able to easily penetrate most vehicles that are faced.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Due to its shape, a penetration in the front (or back) by any actual tank cannon will mean losing the vehicle.\n* The 7° gun depression is far from optimal for players that want to shoot from an hull down position.\n* The massive radio antennas will make you visible even when the rest of the vehicle is hidden behind a hill or small building.\n* Very easy to spot and recognize from the side due to its size and shape; in addition, the side armour won't really stop anything more than small calibre machine gun fire.\n* The roof of the turret is thin, making it vulnerable to airborne attacks.\n* Very slow when moving in soft terrain (mud, snow, sand).\n* High risk of ammunition explosion if the turret is penetrated, thanks to the large first-stage ammo rack behind the cannon.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The army placed an order for the production of 600 of these vehicles, but the outbreak of the war and the occupation of France did not allow the vehicle to be put into production. They returned to an interesting project after the war - the wheelbase received an oscillating turret with a 75 mm gun, which turned the all-terrain vehicle into a light wheeled tank. Later, the base of this vehicle became the basis for several curious army vehicles. It is interesting that it was the Panhard all-terrain vehicle that served as a carriage for the farewell ceremony for the President of the Fifth Republic, General Charles de Gaulle.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_panhard_ebr_1954 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"E.B.R.
