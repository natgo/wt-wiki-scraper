In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe ELC bis' armour is only sufficient to protect against small arms fire, and the 2-man crew means there is little chance of survival if shot at. In particular, while the front hull armour and parts of the front turret armour are sufficient to protect against .50 cals, there are weak spots on the front turret with an effective thickness as low as 13 mm, notably around the driver, making any encounter with vehicles equipped with .50 cals potentially deadly, even at up to 1500 m. The ELC can survive low shots however, as both the engine and transmission sit in the front of tank, and thus can absorb most of the damage if directly hit.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\nThe ELC bis has a formidable top speed of 87 km/h (AB) and 80 km/h (RB/SB). However, it suffers from poor acceleration and speed retention through turns, which is particularly noticeable in RB/SB, where the ELC will in practice only reach 60 km/h at most even when fully upgraded. Thus, its mobility on the battlefield is comparable to the American [[M50]] and [[M56]], which both stand at the same BR. The reverse speed is only of -10 km/h, too slow to escape dangerous encounters, which is something players must keep in mind when engaging enemies. In contrast, the ELC bis has a particularly good power-to-weight ratio, even when compared to other light vehicles at the same BR.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=256|rbMinHp=159}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|D915 (90 mm)}}\n\nThe 90 mm D915 cannon is unsuited for long range due to the poor ballistics of the HEATFS, and fails to make up for it in close quarters due to the average reload time. In addition, stabilizing the gun after stopping takes a few seconds, making snapshots impossible.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[D915 (90 mm)|90 mm D915]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Vehicles with exposed crew aren't particularly common at the ELC's battle rating, the main vehicles the ELC encounters where the machine gun can prove useful against are the American [[M42 Duster (Family)|M42]] and [[M56]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[MAC 31 (7.5 mm)|7.5 mm MAC 31]]\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nDespite looking like one, it is important to remember that the ELC bis is not a light tank. It is strictly a tank destroyer, a fact highlighted by the absence of the scouting ability. The ELC bis is mobile but is generally slower than other light vehicles of the same BR, thus it is not really able to capture points early-on. The ELC excels in camouflage and in taking spots normally unattainable, and the gameplay generally revolves around this. The ELC bis is best unseen: .50 cal MGs, which are common at the BR, can penetrate weak spots on the front turret and immediately knock out the crew. In addition, the reload speed being simply average makes engaging multiple enemies not desirable. But in RB and SB, that is where the ELC's top-notch camouflaging ability comes into play, as the ELC bis can take the time to choose its targets carefully and patiently wait for the right time to strike. The slow reverse speed can be deadly if an engagement turns out dangerous, but this can be alleviated with a promptly-timed usage of the smoke grenades.\n\nHEATFS being the ELC's only available shell, large tanks can be hard to deal with, but in particular, extra care is required against the [[Centurion Mk.5 AVRE]], as its ERA armour is extremely efficient against HEATFS rounds.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Incredibly small profile, can hide in places that are simply impossible for other vehicles\n* Good mobility\n* Formidable top speed of 80 km/h\n* HEATFS rounds with 320 mm of penetration, making enemy armour not a concern\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Only 2 crew members, both sitting in a small turret: hits on the turret are nearly always fatal\n* Front turret weak spots make the ELC vulnerable to .50 cal MGs even from the front\n* Weak top armour: 20 mm cannons and 50 cal MGs found on aircraft rip right through and knock out the crew as well\n* Rarely reaches its top speed in RB and SB\n* Reverse speed is underwhelming for a light tank\n* Cannot fully traverse the turret 360 degrees\n* Low muzzle velocity on the HEATFS shells: not suited for engaging moving targets at long range\n* Low gun elevation\n* Tank rocks back and forth when coming to a stop, which makes aiming very hard\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
