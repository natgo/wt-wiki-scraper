It excels at flanking and catching the enemy of guard. To get the best from this tank in battle, use it speed and manoeuvrability to your advantage. Since the Excelsior is a heavy tank it armour offers up to 114 mm of protection and if angled it can further increase it to offer over 210 mm. Allowing the tank to become immune to virtually all enemy rounds. However, the thickest parts of the armour plate is on the front of the tank and front of the turret, so it is important to keep the front pointed towards the enemy in combat.\n\nCombined with the 75 mm cannon, which has a reload of up to five seconds, it is able to cause mayhem on the battlefield. load M61 Shot round and fire away, always aim for the sides and rear of the enemy tanks, this is the weakest parts, when at range. However, when fighting tiger tanks get as close as you can, approach from the rear and shoot the rear of the turret, it will knock the tigers turret out allowing you to head to its side and knock it out with some precision shots.\n\nThe A 33 Excelsior, does not have any turret mounted machine guns, its roof armour is only 25 mm thick allowing enemy aircraft to cause havoc. To evade the aircraft use smoke and head towards any additional smoke rounds which you may fire, this will prevent the aircraft from following you and allowing you to evade them.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

However, until such a design could be formulated, they still needed a tank for the assault role the infantry tanks would take.\n\nRolls-Royce Company, the company producing the prototype [[Cromwell V|A27 Cromwells]], suggested that the Tank Board use the A27 as an interim design with stronger armour, suspension, and armament. The suggestion was supported with the English Electric Company, whom plan to upgrade the A27 with thicker armour and elements from the American [[M6A1|M6 heavy tank]].\n\n===Development and Cancellation===\nOn 07 May 1942<ref name=\"TMuseumValiant\">Newsome, Bruce. \"TANK INFANTRY A38, VALIANT (E1952.39).\" Tankmuseum.org. The Tank Museum, n.d. Web. 10 May 2017. [https://web.archive.org/web/20180721133452/http://www.tankmuseum.org/museum-online/vehicles/object-e1952-39 Web Archive]</ref>, Tank Board approved for the production of these uparmoured A27 under the designation '''A33''', though it would also have the name '''Excelsior'''. English Electric Company were in charge of producing the uparmoured A27 models and produced two prototypes. The first had the M6 suspension system and a [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder Mk.III (57 mm)|6-pdr]] cannon. The second had a wider track, different armoured skirts, additional frontal armour, and a [[Ordnance QF Mk.V (75 mm)|75 mm gun]]. Both used the same V12 Meteor engine as the A27.\n\nReliability issues with the Churchill were soon ironed out by 1943, to the point it became a very successful infantry support vehicle and multiple variations were made based off the chassis. The A33 Excelsior, meant to replace the Churchill, was no longer needed and the project was dropped in 1943.\n\nToday, the second prototype can be seen at the Bovington Tank Museum.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_a_33_excelsior Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|d27p2Kg06MA|'''The Shooting Range #302''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:54 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|j1Hl_niR_RU|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Churchill VII]]\n* [[Churchill III]] / [[Pz.Kpfw.
