Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Light support tank FCM.36) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. Though affectionately nicknamed the \"Cone\" due to the turret's shape. The FCM.36 was removed as a researchable vehicle from the main tech tree during [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]] after the ammo update that rendered its armament impotent, though it is still unlockable after reaching rank II French ground vehicles.\n\nGenerally speaking, what used to be the main reason you'd play the FCM.36 is so it can unlock better vehicles like the [[AMR.35 ZT3]] to have better firepower at the rank. Bearing the awful [[SA18 L/21 (37 mm)|37 mm SA18 L/21]] cannon as the main armament with 40 mm of armour all around and bad mobility, this tank resembles the [[H.35]] in many ways. However, the FCM.36 does have well-sloped armour for the rank to be a tad useful during long range engagements, but the underperforming gun makes the FCM.36 act more like a shield rather than a spear.\n\nCompared to the [[H.35]], the {{PAGENAME}} features a design with \"better\" armour and a more powerful engine, bringing the power ratio to a more manageable 12.4 HP/ton. With wider tracks than the H.35, this tank feels faster than other BR 1.0 French tanks. It turns quite smoothly and reaches its top speed fairly easily on road. 40 mm all around is enough to survive incoming rounds at long distances (~ 500+ m) but its bad angling makes it unreliable at close range, whereas your gun enters its actual combat ranges. Keeping the awful SA18 L/21 canon as the main armament, this gun is what makes an otherwise good tank so bad as it is. As the Devblog claims: \"Wait Until You See The Whites of Their Eyes!\", you will have to get up close and personal with this tank in order to penetrate another tank. With -17° of gun depression, this is actually a depressing gun.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Blind such big guns with your good MAC 31 coaxial machine gun and attempt a few shots on the move (big guns generally means poor armour at this BR).\n\nIf you intend to play in RB or SB, use brush or other objects to obscure your vehicle's outline, so that the enemy doesn't entirely know what you are, and therefore have a chance of not taking shots at your weak points such as your gun mantle or driver port.\n\nOne notable recent change is that due to the new volumetric shells, it is nearly impossible to hit the FCM.36's vulnerable turret ring. In addition, it is much harder to actually damage anything from shooting through the weak spot on the mantlet; The commander's right side is protected by the large drum of the MAC 31, and hits to his left will now often hit the breech. This makes the FCM much more well protected. Shots that penetrate will usually be absorbed by various parts inside the turret.\n\n'''\"Brawler\":'''\n\n''Never'' engage an enemy upfront: assist your allies in flanking manœuvres and don't bother stealing a score since it's all you can get with such a poor cannon. Feel free to turn you back anytime and flee when allies are lacking, go find friends and act as a bullet magnet for them as they attempt to flank enemies.\n\n'''Not the size that matters its the technique'''\n\nIn the right hands, this tank can be used correctly to a degree.

FCM was an experienced tank manufacturer, having proved themselves with work on previous projects (such as the Char 2C and Char B1), and quickly developed a new light tank design. Just over a year after the initial wooden mockup was presented and approved by the Army, the first prototype was tested in April 1935. During the one year testing period, multiple changes were made to make the vehicle more reliable, lighter, and better protected.\n\nIn July 1936, the FCM 36 was declared the best of three competing vehicles (which included the Hotchkiss H35 and Renault R35), although all three vehicles were still produced. But due to the Rhineland crisis in May 1936, the FCM company received orders for 100 of the FCM 36 tanks before it was even proclaimed the winner of the competition. Production of the FCM 36 did not begin until 1937, after tests of an improved version failed to produce the desired results. The first FCM 36 tanks left the factory floor in May 1938, and joined the ranks of the Army the following year. After the initial order of 100 vehicles was fulfilled, production was discontinued in favour of the Char B1, (also manufactured by FCM).\n\nDuring the Invasion of France in 1940, the 100 FCM 36s in service with the French army saw limited success against the latest German armour—most notably the Panzer III. Although both vehicles offered similar overall performance, long tank battles against the Panzer III often resulted with neither vehicle able to achieve a fatal blow against the other. Unfortunately, the welds of the FCM 36's heavily angled and complex armour would eventually break from extensive and repeated battle damage, which left the Panzer III as the victor in the long run. During the German occupation, the FCM 36 was initially used by the German army as a training or reserve vehicle. In 1943/44, 37 captured FCM 36s were converted into tank destroyers or self-propelled artillery pieces.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5190-development-fcm-36-wait-until-you-see-the-whites-of-their-eyes-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_fcm_36 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|e2ye8281W3I|'''What Is The Definition Of Insanity - {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''Virus''|rpvKhy22Erc|'''The Shooting Range #85''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:54 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|Gb_o29aOZHY|'''{{PAGENAME}}, French, Tier-1, Light Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|6_r3zPh8vjQ|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5190-development-fcm-36-wait-until-you-see-the-whites-of-their-eyes-en|[Devblog] FCM 36 - Wait Until You See The Whites of Their Eyes!]]\n* [[wikipedia:FCM_36|[Wikipedia] FCM 36]]\n* [https://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/france/FCM-36.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Char FCM 36]\n\n{{France light tanks}}"}}
