If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Arcade Battles\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} does not have any additional armaments to attack other vehicles or protect itself, limiting its offensive ability towards even slightly-armoured targets. Due to this, moving any distance from the spawn point will result in death due to the thin armour and increased visibility, due to vehicle markers, making the {{PAGENAME}} an easy target. Both the Roland 1 and Roland 3 SAMs have a maximum speed of 900 m/s, with payloads of 3.3 kg and 4.45 kg of Composition B respectably, more than enough to deal with the only aircraft type (helicopters) it will encounter in this game mode. Moving alongside allies or waiting in or near spawn areas - where the {{PAGENAME}} has the best view of the sky - will be rewarding as when engaging medium to heavily armoured units, the explosive mass of the missiles will be most useful in destroying or disabling targets, requiring knowledge of vulnerable spots on enemy vehicles to deliver a finishing blow. Due to the large explosive mass of both missiles, it can destroy light targets with overpressure.\n\n;Realistic Battles\n\nIn Realistic Battles, the vehicle's primary purpose is as an anti-aircraft weapon. There is no weapons on the {{PAGENAME}} that can serve as meaningful anti-armour tools (although the Roland 3's 54 mm of penetration can allow creative players to penetrate through light-armour or tank roofs) and the armour may as well be nonexistent. The vehicle is quite mobile however, and so the mobility should be used alongside the {{PAGENAME}}'s excellent radars by getting into optimal positions to search and engage targets.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}}'s battlefield performance is greatly assisted by its SAG MPDR-16 search radar. Able to search targets up to 16 kilometers away in a 360 degree angle, the {{PAGENAME}} can serve as a really good warning indicator to alert teammates of any incoming airborne threats. Accompanying the search radar is the Thomson-CSF Domino 30 tracking radar that allows the {{PAGENAME}} player to begin locking onto targets from 12 kilometers away, which can allow a lot of breathing room for players to first locate the aerial target, track it, then engage once it approaches the Roland missile's firing range (6.3 km on the Roland 1 and 8 km on the Roland 3).\n\nOne issue with the above mentioned attack strategy is when encountering an aircraft with a radar-warning receiver (RWR). The {{PAGENAME}}'s searching and tracking function will trigger their RWR, leading them to know a radar-equipped SPAA is present and will perform evasive manoeuvre such as using the terrain to mask itself. To prevent this, the {{PAGENAME}}'s search radar can be configured to use the Infrared Search and Track (IRST) feature, which tracks the enemy by its heat instead of by radar. This benefits by not notifying the enemy that a radar has got it locked, but the IRST feature may produce less accurate tracking than radar.\n\nOnce the {{PAGENAME}} has gotten an aerial target locked on by radar or IRST, fire a Roland 1/3 missile once the enemy aircraft has gotten into range. The missile is controlled by \"semi-automatic command to line of sight\" (SACLOS) which only requires the player to place the crosshair onto target and the missile will head towards the crosshair's center. Pointing directly at an aerial target will only be simple if attacking a hovering helicopter of a jet heading right towards the {{PAGENAME}}, however most of the time when fighting fast-moving jets, the player-controlled crosshair may be able to track the aircraft faster than the missile. This will require the player to lead ahead of the aircraft with the crosshair, keeping an eye on the trailing missile to make sure its tracer is hovering right on top of the aircraft so that once it reaches the aircraft's range, it will detonate and take out or cripple the aircraft.\n\nNote that the Roland missiles can be fired from the {{PAGENAME}} without a radar lock in case of emergencies, however this may require players to work a little harder to keep the {{PAGENAME}}'s turret continually pointing towards the enemy aircraft as the search/track radar does give some assistance in keeping the locked enemy in front of the {{PAGENAME}} turret. That said, the advantage of the {{PAGENAME}}'s ability to fire without a lock means that the enemy aircraft's countermeasures like flares or chaff will not affect the Roland missile flight, keeping the probability of a hit narrowed down to the player's skill and the enemy aircraft's ability to evade.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Has Roland 3 missiles as a tier 2 modification, increasing the vehicle's offensive range to 8.5 km\n* Roland 1 and Roland 3 missiles are reactive and manoeuvrable\n* Active radar system with a scan range of 15 km\n* Slightly higher-than-average max speed (70 km/h)\n* Autoloader with 5-second reload\n* Roland SAMs maintain their top speed up until their respective max range, and do not decelerate like other SAMs\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Significantly lower missile velocity compared to the ADATS (1,200 m/s) and Stormer HVM (1,400 m/s)\n* Only two missiles available before having to reload\n* Lack of additional armament for close-range or armoured targets\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
