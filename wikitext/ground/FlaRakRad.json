In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"New Power\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n[[File:FlaRakRad internal armor.png|thumb|Internal armour of the FlaRakRad (5 mm)]]\nAs the FlaRakRad is the largest ground vehicle in game, and an SPAA, it is not hard for one to guess how the protection situation is. As there is no armour to speak of, the best bet for protecting this vehicle is not to be seen. Try hiding behind large hills, buildings near spawn, and other large obstacles. The non retractable search radar makes it hard to find spots tall enough to hide the FlaRakRad's immense size. However, due to the size of this vehicle, it can take ATGMs from helis occasionally, and can sometimes even eat APFSDS. However, any shot is very likely to cripple you, as the transmission is huge and easily hit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nIt is recommended to change the radar range from 10 to 16 km, find a concealed spot near spawn and memorize where the helicopters' airfield is. Helicopters are easy prey for the FlaRakRad; but be careful to take them out quickly or you'll find you have a 9M127 Vikhr headed right at you. Be careful to not radar lock helicopters, as they usually have RWR and will detect you if you lock them. Try instead to hand guide the missiles. This isn't as hard as it seems, as helicopters mostly hover and without the RWR won't know where the missile is coming from. Once the VT1 missile is unlocked, this allows the FlaRakRad to be able to finally engage aircraft with any hint of reliability. Still, one must exercise discipline when choosing when to engage aircraft, as the VT1 can still be dodged. As for the VT1 against helicopters, it just allows the FlaRakRad to kill enemy helicopters quicker, giving them less time to react. All in all, the FlaRakRad is a competent SPAA once one unlocks the missile and has the flexibility to engage aircraft as well as helis. Keep in mind that after firing the second missile, the FlaRakRad will not begin reloading until the second missile hits a target or reaches its max range and self-destructs. This means if you miss the second missile, you are vulnerable to air attack while waiting to reload. Take care not to be hit, and you'll have a good time.\n\n=== Countering [[9K127_Vikhr|Vikhr]]-equipped helicopters ===\nExperienced [[Ka-50]]/[[Ka-52|52]] players will often fire multiple Vikr missiles at you, hoping that the first two of them will neutralize your missiles or they will have loaded rockets that will explode after a fixed distance and will try to shoot your VT1 missiles. You can make their life hard if you circle the target by moving the aiming reticle around the target in small circles, causing your missile to change direction really fast and making it nearly impossible to counter if done right. Remember that you do not need to hit the target directly due to the missile's proximity fuse.\n\n=== Countering advanced planes ===\nExperienced pilots will try to side-climb outside your range and will try to attack from the top where your radar will not show the incoming plane. In order to prevent this from happening, set the range of the radar to 16 km instead of 10 km to detect any side-climbing planes to prioritize before they climb above the maximum radar elevation range.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Good speed and mobility; easy to move around on larger maps\n* High speed missile with long range\n* 1st generation gunner thermals allow the FlaRakRad to track targets without the use of radar easier\n* Missile has enough explosive to destroy lightly armored vehicles, and even tanks via overpressure through the turret roof or hull belly.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* The single biggest ground vehicle in the game, longer and taller than a Maus - finding proper concealment is nigh impossible\n* Every single gun in the game, MGs included, poses a threat\n* No reliable defence against any ground vehicles\n* Lack of guns means it cannot defend itself from close aircraft should missiles miss or run out\n* No survivability from attacks from the ground or air\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

While the army version of the FlaRakPz 1 self-propelled air defense system was equipped with a tracked chassis, the air defense services and the German naval forces settled on wheeled chassis for AA systems for airfield protection. At the end of the 90's, a MAN 6x6 truck was chosen as a chassis for the Roland 2 complex, but soon a unified command vehicle on the chassis of the MAN 15t mil gl KAT I A1 (8×8) truck was adopted, which served as the basis for further development of the Roland family.\n\nOne of the latest modernization programs for the complex for the needs of the German army assumed the possibility of launching not only Roland 2 and Roland 3 missiles, but also promising long-range VT1 missiles, but the program was not completed and by 2003 Germany refused to further modernize the Roland complex in favor of more modern systems.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=germany&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=spaa&vehicle=germ_flarakrad Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"FlaRakRad Devblog Images\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:FlaRakRad WTWallpaper 001.jpg|\nFile:FlaRakRad WTWallpaper 002.jpg|\nFile:FlaRakRad WTWallpaper 003.jpg|\nFile:FlaRakRad WTWallpaper 004.jpg|\nFile:FlaRakRad WTWallpaper 005.jpg|\nFile:FlaRakRad WTWallpaper 006.jpg|\nFile:FlaRakRad WTWallpaper 007.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6902-development-flarakrad-protective-sphere-en|[Devblog] FlaRakRad: Protective Sphere]]\n\n{{Germany anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
