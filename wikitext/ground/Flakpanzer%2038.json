In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''', officially named ''Flakpanzer 38(t) auf Selbstfahrlafette 38(t) Ausf M (Sd.Kfz. 140)'', is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.47 \"Big Guns\"]]. It is sometimes, incorrectly, referred to as the ''Gepard'', which may lead to confusion with the unrelated [[Gepard|Flakpanzer Gepard]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof\n|-\n| Hull || 10 mm (65°) ''Front glacis'' <br> 20 mm (14°) ''Lower glacis'' || 15 mm || 10-15 mm (40°) || 8 mm\n|-\n| Gun shield || 7 mm ''Turret front'' <br> 7 mm ''Gun mantlet''\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|}\n\nThe Flakpanzer 38(t) has thin but highly sloped front armour that resists small-calibre machine gun bullets and even 12.7 mm machine gun rounds at a distance. The gun shield will shrug off smaller rifle-calibre rounds but not 12.7 mm bullets and larger. Like its predecessor, the [[Flakpanzer I]], it maintains a limited crew of two and is also easily destroyed by overpressure. Common threats include HE shells, artillery strikes, air-dropped bombs, HEAT projectiles, strafing planes and HMG fire.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=213|rbMinHp=133}}\n\nTop speed and power-to-weight ratio are much higher than the [[Flakpanzer I]], topping out at 46 km/h forward, -6 km/h backwards, and a power-to-weight ratio in realistic and simulator battles of 15.31 hp/ton.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nFor this vehicle, two very important modifications to keep an eye out for are the Sprgr. and PzGr 40 ammo belts. The first provides a boost to the vehicle's anti-air capabilities, being completely filled with high explosive shells, and the second turns the Flakpanzer into a deadly anti-tank machine with high-penetration HVAP rounds.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|FlaK38 (20 mm)}}\n\nThe gun is the same as its predecessor, the FlaK38. It has sufficient HE shells for planes, 37 mm penetration AP-I, and 48 mm penetration HVAP. The belt size is identical. Reload between clips is long. The gun can pen most things the tank encounters, barring Valentines, Matildas, B1 bis, B1 ter, and T-28E.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[FlaK38 (20 mm)|20 mm FlaK38]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAt the start of the match, you can camp around the spawn point and wait until the enemy planes show up, this is the safest way, but it's passive and not efficient in terms of getting kills. So if you are brave / skilled enough, use it as a light tank as it has 42 km/h top speed. The 20 mm cannon is very deadly against any light and fast vehicles, it can finish up their crew easily when penetrated. However you must be very careful as the Flakpanzer 38 only has 2 crew, and losing one means death. Unfortunately, the gunner is the most exposed and unprotected crew and is extremely vulnerable to everything: artillery, MG fire, planes, small bombs, rockets, etc. Do whatever you can to stay alive, as this vehicle has more potential as the match progresses. Pick on those soft targets and avoid heavily armoured ones to ensure effective penetration and killing.\n\nWhen shooting planes, avoid opening fire when the plane is far away from you. This will only waste your ammo and give your position away to both the plane and the tanks. Instead you have two tactics: one is to passively wait until the plane flies close and is unaware of you, then suddenly open fire. The other tactic is a bit risky. First find a good cover so you are not likely to get shot from tanks. Then regardless of the plane's distance from you, fire some random shells at it to get their attention. Once they know you're there, a lot of pilots will turn towards you and try to kill you, knowing that SPAAs usually have weak protection. When they're flying head-on towards you, use the fast fire rate and spray a stream of shells in their path and wait for them to crash into your shells, then quickly move away to dodge the bullets. Tip: aim slightly above the plane to compensate for the shell drop, as the distance between you and the plane is usually greater than you think.\n\nIn the late stages of the match you should be even more careful, as at this time most people will take out their SPAAs, and those fast-firing guns are your biggest threat. Try and be more aware of the surrounding situations, avoid running into anyone. Use the mobility to flank and the small profile to ambush.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Great firepower: wonderful combination of rapid firerate, adequate velocity, 20 round mag and various belt types- Sprgr. belt is destructive against low tier aircraft, while PzGr 40 is very deadly against armoured targets (eg. [[M3A3 (Italy)|M3A3]], [[T-60]] or even the [[B1 bis]])\n* Fast turret traverse allows it to keep up with close/fast targets easily, while the great gun elevation and depression means it can fight in any terrain\n* Small frontal profile allows it to hide behind cover or bushes easily, which mitigates against its lack of protection\n* Decent top speed of 42 km/h means it can get to certain positions alongside light tanks, which is great for ambushing\n* Thin turret armour can make some shells over-penetrate, dealing little damage\n* Hull armour can resist 12.7 mm bullets, commonly used on US tanks like [[M13 MGMC]] and [[M8 Greyhound (Family)|M8 Greyhound]]\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Extremely poor survivability: only two crew protected by thin armour makes it easily to get destroyed by overpressure\n* Rather long reload time requires strict trigger control\n* The PzGr 40 belt is mixed with low-penetrating belts, reducing its anti-tank capability as half of the shells sometimes won't be able to penetrate\n* Slow reverse speed of only -6 km/h can get the player killed due to not being able to retreat from danger quickly\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The vehicle was produced from November, 1943 to February, 1944. The first 87 Flakpanzer 38(t) AA vehicles appeared at the front in January, 1944 and made up Flugabwehrzug (AA platoons) in tank divisions and tank grenadier divisions (sometimes in Waffen SS divisions such as the Hitlerjugend 12th Waffen SS division in Norway in 1944).\n\nIn 1944-1945 Flakpanzer 38(t) AA vehicles were used actively on the Italian and Western Fronts, where they were effective against low-flying aircraft.\n\nA total of 141 Flakpanzer 38(t) AA vehicles were released.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_flakpanzer_38t_Gepard Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|naeDoEwZ5Pg|'''German SPAAs''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:19 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|BawYltMDHtg|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Flakpanzer I]]\n* [[Ta-Se]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{Germany anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
