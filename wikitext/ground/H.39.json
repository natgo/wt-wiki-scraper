In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Hotchkiss light tank model 1935 modified 1939) is a reserve rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]] and replaced the [[H.35]] as one of France's two reserve vehicles in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]].\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the H.39 features a serviceable gun, thicker armour, and a significantly more powerful engine, which makes it, when fully upgraded, surprisingly speedy on flat ground for low level French tanks.  Nevertheless, this vehicle's gun and mobility are below average compared its peers from other nations. While it is mobile in a straight line, it manoeuvres slowly and its narrow tracks slow it down substantially cross-country. The H.39 should be played as a close support tank, best utilized in urban maps and following its teammates while waiting for a good shot opportunity.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members.

However, its armour should not be relied upon; most reserve tank guns are capable of penetrating its raw armour thickness and have faster reloads, so hard cover should be utilized generously. With only 2 crewmen, any penetrating shot could be your last.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Offensive role\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} was designed as a light infantry tank. It should be played as a support tank, taking advantage of its good cannon, armour and mobility.\nBy playing as a support tank, you will help kill enemy tanks and thus turn the tide of engagements on the frontline. Once the enemy is destroyed, your mobility allows you to move forward together with frontline tanks and help capturing objectives.\nStay close to the frontline to maximize penetration power and support spearheading tanks with it, all while staying away from the frontline to avoid being flanked or swarmed.\nWhen engaging enemy tanks, angle your tank to maximize your armour. Your cannon can take on most opponents but your only shell lacks post-penetration damage.\n\n;Defensive role\n\nIn the event the spearhead tanks of your team get crushed by the enemy, you will then play a defensive role by containing enemy breakthrough attempts.\nBeing at a (short) distance from the frontline will force enemy tanks to drive in the open to get to you. Play with a nearby obstacle you can use as cover if you get hit and need to repair. Have a planned escape plan as the enemy will try to use artillery or CAS to dislodge you from cover. Make good use of your gun depression and fire from the cover of a ridge. Aim precisely to immobilize enemy targets on your first shot. Get back into cover between reloads and pop out a few meters away from your last spot.\n\n;Other roles\n\nIf you try to use the {{PAGENAME}} in a different role on the battlefield, you will quickly reach its limits:\n\n* If you try to play as a frontline tank, you will take shots from long range tank destroyers that will disable your tank: your armour is sloped but not very thick and not enough for long guns. Your limited crew makes it easy to incapacitate you. You will also be easily flanked by light tanks or armoured cars, especially if they swarm you. Your reverse speed is too poor to get you out of hot spots quickly enough. Only 1-on-1 engagements should be performed in this role.\n* If you attempt to play long range engagements, your good gun depression will be useful but your short gun will lack accuracy and your shell penetration will greatly drop over distance. Any successful enemy penetrating shot will disable your tank.\n\n;Notable enemies:\n\nMany tanks are capable of easily disabling you. By order of lethality:\n\n* Long range tank destroyers\n* Howitzers with powerful HE shells\n* Tanks with HEAT shells\n* Frontline tanks with APHE shells\n* Light tanks or armoured cars with autocannons\n\n;Defeating a {{PAGENAME}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has several weak spots:\n\n* In a frontal encounter, the driver's hatch or the almost vertical hull below the turret are the easiest to target.\n* When flanking, aim for the flanks right under the turret.\n* In all situations the turret cupola is a sure way to knock out the gunner.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Tiny tank with tiny profile\n* -13° of gun depression\n* Has a gun stabilizer mechanic, which makes stop-and-shoot tactics easier and faster\n* Thick all-around armour that can be very strongly angled\n* Moderately powerful engine that can keep it at its 41 km/h top speed on flat ground\n* Decent reverse speed of -7 km/h\n* Arguably the best French rank 1 tank\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Only 2 crew members\n* Only one choice of ammunition, which has no explosive filler\n* Sub-par penetration\n* Long reload for the caliber\n* Slow turret rotation \n* Driver's hatch is almost completely vertical\n* Narrow tracks means poor ground flotation\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Originally armed with the same SA 18 short gun as the H.35 and R.35, it saw service with the 342nd Independent Tank Company in Norway (which went over to the Free French with their tanks and fought with them in 1941 in Syria), and equipped six of the tank battalions (14th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 42nd and 45th) in the three pre-war armoured divisions, and 12 cavalry squadrons. The SA 18-armed version is sometimes referred to (erroneously) as the H.38.\n\nThe poor anti-tank performance of the First World War-era 37 mm infantry gun (on which the SA 18 tank gun was based) during the Spanish Civil War led to the redesigned SA 38. In total 358 SA 18-armed tanks, mostly H.39 and H.35, would be rearmed with the new gun before the invasion of France, with several hundred more being produced as France fell. Up-gunned H.35s and H.39s were employed by the French as section- and platoon-leader vehicles.\n\nAfter the fall of France, the Germans retrofitted some of their captured vehicles with the newer gun, and replaced the commander's cupola with their more customary split hatch for the tank commander. These vehicles, which the Germans called the 38H 735, fought in Finland in 1941, in the Balkans, and against the Allies in France. In December of 1944, 29 were still in German service. Another 24 were cut down to just the hull pan and nose armour and used as Geschutzwagen (assault guns), and armed with the PaK 40/L46 75mm gun, making them similar in appearance to the Marder I conversion from captured Lorraine Schlepper vehicles. These were actively employed against Allied forces in Normandy. Some recaptured H.39s served with Free French forces to the end of the war.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_hotchkiss_h39 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|1jBtGvfL4hI|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[H.35]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Hotchkiss_H35|[Wikipedia] Hotchkiss H35/39]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/france/Hotchkiss_H35_39.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Hotchkiss H35/39]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Hotchkiss}}\n{{France light tanks}}"}}
