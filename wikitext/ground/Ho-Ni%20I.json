In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|一式砲戦車「ホニI」|Isshiki Hō-Sensha [Ho-Ni I]}}) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]].\n\nSimilar in appearance to the Ho-Ro before it, it changes out the 150 mm artillery cannon for a more traditional high-velocity gun, being one of the most powerful ones at its rank.\n\nHowever, with no turret and very bad armour protection, it demands caution and patience, in exchange for being able to smash through even the heaviest tanks it faces. The fearsome Char B1, the terror of Rank I for example, is no match for the Ho-Ni. Play this tank with caution and you will be rewarded greatly.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Ho-Ni I's excellent firepower and good mobility is balanced out by its very poor armour protection. The front of the hull is covered in unsloped 25 mm plates, which is only sufficient to protect the tank from machinegun rounds - and even then some high-calibre guns (such as the 50 cal or DShK) can find their way through.\n\nIn addition, the gun compartment of the tank is uncovered, leaving the gunner and commander extremely vulnerable to artillery, machine guns, and aircraft attack. As the tank only has three crew members, the two being knocked out will leave the vehicle inoperable. Be sure to immediately retreat away from any artillery, preferably with your front facing the area being attacked, in order to protect the crew.\n\nIt is also important to try not to arouse the attention of enemy aircraft, as the open design means that any fighter plane can easily destroy you in a single strafe. With no machine gun, it does not have any means of fighting back against them either, so stay in the shadows!\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=241|rbMinHp=150}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is based off the Chi-Ha chassis, which Japanese ground forces will be familiar with since it is featured on other Japanese early tanks: [[Chi-Ha]],[[Chi-Ha Kai]], [[Ho-Ro]] and [[Ho-Ni III]].\n\nThus, it has a fairly good level of mobility, reaching a peak speed of 36 km/h on flat grass in Realistic, with a theoretical maximum of 40 km/h. It also has a quite good traverse rate, both on the hull and the gun, performing a full 360 degree rotation from a stop in about 16 seconds.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|Type 90 (75 mm)}}\n\nPacking a high-velocity 75 mm Type 90 cannon, the Ho-Ni I has a serious amount of firepower.\n\nIts Type 1 APHE shell has up to 100 mm of armour penetration, which is the second best of tank destroyers at its rank, only beaten by the Soviet ZiS-30, and being very closely followed by the American M3 GMC.\n\nHowever, a cannon this big does come with two drawbacks; being that it has a fairly long reload time of 7.8 seconds, and no turret, meaning it can only aim in an arc in front of you. Thus, it is important that you make sure your shot lands, and that you are well aware of your surroundings, so that you do not end up wasting precious time turning your entire hull towards an enemy. You should play this tank as a support vehicle, hiding in bushes and shooting at targets at medium range. Chances are, you'll be able to penetrate and score one-shot after one-shot. You could also play as a sniper, if you are so inclined.\n\nThe Ho-Ni I does also not feature any machine guns, which leaves it unable to fight back against enemy aircraft or uncovered vehicles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Type 90 (75 mm)|75 mm Type 90]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Ho-Ni I should be played like most open crew compartment, fixed gun tank destroyers, fighting from a distance from the front-lines and delivering support fire. The thin armour means the Ho-Ni I will not survive a direct confrontation with any enemy tank and will require the vehicle to obtain the fighting advantage of being able to target the enemy first to ensure any chance of victory. The Ho-Ni I should also be wary of enemy aerial attacks as the open compartment and three-man crew means that an accurate strafing fire could potentially knock out the entire crew.\n\nAt its battle rating, the worst the Ho-Ni I could face are the German [[Pz.IV E]] and British [[Cromwell V]] and [[Matilda Mk II]]. The two medium tanks have sufficient armour to withstand the 75 mm gun while the Matilda II requires precise shot in order to destroy it frontally - the driver's port. All of these tanks have guns able to shred the Ho-Ni I apart if they could get a bead on it. The [[B1 bis|Char B1]] can also be a challenge, the only way to deal with it head on is by shooting the driver's port, which will require making you vulnerable to the powerful 75mm hull gun that tank has.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

They decided to build a series of assault guns based off the [[Chi-Ha|Type 97 Chi-Ha]] chassis. One of the first of these design was the '''Ho-Ni I''' which had the Type 97 chassis fitted with a 75 mm Type 90 field gun.<ref name=\"ZalogaJapaneseTank\">Zaloga Steven. ''Japanese Tanks 1939-1945'' Great Britain: Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2007</ref>\n\nThe Ho-Ni I was used in China by the 3rd Tank Division and on Luzon by the 2nd Tank Division. It could be used as mechanized artillery or as a tank destroyer/assault gun. A total of 124 were built.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_3_ho_ni_I Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[Wikipedia:Type_1_Ho-Ni_I|[Wikipedia] Type 1 Ho-Ni I]]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{Japan tank destroyers}}"}}
