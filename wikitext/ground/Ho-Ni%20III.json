In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|三式砲戦車「ホニIII」|San-Shiki Hō-Sensha [Ho-Ni III]}}) is a Rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the entire Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]]. It handles and plays very similarly to the Ho-Ni I before it, but has been refined with the addition of more crew, a faster reload time, and most importantly, armour around the gun crew. However, it pays a slight cost of reduced top speed.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nHaving 25 mm of armour coverage around the entire gun crew, the {{PAGENAME}} no longer needs to fear artillery shrapnel or strafing runs from fighter aircraft. Do note however that it's still vulnerable to bombs, rockets and direct artillery hits! However, if the {{PAGENAME}} takes a hit, likely to survive with more operational crewmembers, as three of them must be knocked out before the vehicle becomes inoperable.\n\nAnother small armour increase is seen on the front of the tank, with the driver and radio station protected with another 10 mm of armour, though with this added strength, it still leaves an undesirable total width of a lacking 35 mm.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On flat terrain, it reaches a top speed of 32 km/h, compared to the Ho-Ni I's top speed of 36 km/h.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

With the addition of two dedicated loaders in a fully closed casemate, the gun also gets almost a second cut down on its reload time, making it capable of even more destruction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Type 3 (75 mm)|75 mm Type 3]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

But due to the added weight of the fully enclosed casemate, it is slower compared to its brother [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Chi-Ha]].\n\nWith the added benefit of the casemate and crew, the {{PAGENAME}} sports better survivability, though, most shells will not knock you out in one shot due to having a total of five crew members. The crew isn't out in the open anymore and has sufficient armour from machine-gun fire from both ground & air enemies. Knowing this, you can stand to take more chances of sitting in one location and not have to worry about aircraft making a single pass and taking the vehicle out.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nThe Type 3 Ho-Ni III is a self-propelled anti-tank artillery gun. The Ho-Ni III was the third of the Japanese 'tank destroyers', which Japan developed based on inspiration from the German tanks of this class. This SPG was very similar to the previous models of this series, the Ho-Ni I and Ho-Ni II, but surpassed them in multiple ways, embodying all the very best of each of them. The chassis of the medium Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai tank was used as a base, while the Ho-Ni I and II used a simple, unmodernized version of the Type 97 Chi-Ha. The powerful 75 mm Type 90 field cannon was chosen as a gun. In its design, this was a counterpart of the French 85 mm Schneider cannon (85 mle 1927 Schneider). After a small redesign for installation on the tank, this gun was designated the Type 3. The cannon was installed in an armoured non-rotating superstructure which, in contrast to the Ho-Ni I and Ho-Ni II, was fully enclosed on all sides and provided optimal protection for the crew. Additional ammo took the place of the machine gun in the hull, and the SPG's crew was reduced to four (in comparison to the five of the previous vehicles in this series).\n\nHo-Ni series SPGs went into production in 1942, and the order to design and produce the upgraded Ho-Ni III was received by the Hitachi firm in the beginning of 1944. Due to a shortage of resources and constant bombings, the Japanese industry was only able to produce roughly 35 Ho-Ni III SPGs before the end of the war. Most of them were distributed among divisions tasked with defending Japan itself, while only a few were sent to areas of active military operations such as Okinawa and the Philippines. No records survive of military clashes between the Ho-Ni III and American tanks.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/4361-development-type-3-ho-ni-iii-the-japanese-marder-en/|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_3_ho_ni_III Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|VI9AICEALR4|'''Type 3 Ho-Ni III Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n;Predecessor:\n* [[Ho-Ni I]]\n\n;Other vehicles using [[Chi-Ha]] chassis:\n* [[Chi-Ha Short Gun]]\n* [[Chi-Ha LG]]\n* [[Ho-Ro]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4361-development-type-3-ho-ni-iii-the-japanese-marder-en|[Devblog] Type 3 Ho-Ni III: The Japanese Marder]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Type_3_Ho-Ni_III|[Wikipedia] Type 3 Ho-Ni III]]\n\n{{Japan tank destroyers}}"}}
