In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Red Skies\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe tank gets almost no armour, so you are best off hiding or staying at your teams spawn and being an SPAA. Even light machine guns can kill you. \n\n'''Armour type:'''\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Vents)\n* Bulletproof glass (Windows)\n* Wheel (tires, suspension bars)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
