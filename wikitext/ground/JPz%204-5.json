In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' or ''Kanonenjagdpanzer'' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.53 \"Firestorm\"]]. Built on the [[Ru 251]] chassis, the {{PAGENAME}} takes the design of the World War II [[Jagdpanzer IV]] to have a low profile in order to perform ambush duties against enemy tanks.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe 50 mm thick frontal plate protects the crew against heavy machine gun fire and some small calibre cannons. Care must be taken in regards to strafing planes since .50 cal rounds can penetrate your roof armour with ease, usually resulting in 1-2 crew loss and potential engine fire.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

When the Soviets began deploying their [[T-64A (1971)|T-64]] and [[T-72A|T-72]] main battle tanks, the 90 mm gun was not capable of engaging them in long-range combat and at that point the Kanonenjagdpanzer 90 mm became obsolete, despite the claims from manufacturers that the JPz 4-5 could be rearmed with a 105 mm gun. Once you unlock the HEATFS round, the JPz 4-5's ability to take out enemies will greatly improve.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[BK90 (90 mm)|90 mm BK90]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It shines with excellent mobility and in rate of fire but has some serious downsides as well, such as the lack of a turret and really poor armour all around. The thin armour of this tank leaves little space for mistakes. Know the map and flank your enemies making use your excellent mobility, but don't get too carried away. Use your great mobility to get a great sniping spot early game, rather than just rushing into a capture point, because if you do, you're most likely going to be in a close-combat fight with another tank at the capture point, and the JPz isn't great in close quarters combat. When you first spawn, drive and find a flanking position that allows you to quickly drive into cover with your fast reverse gear if you make a mistake. Scan the environment for enemies and take them out one by one, but don't get too carried away with it, once you kill 2 or 3 enemy tanks get out of that area and find a different spot, because most players will be looking for you when they respawn in another tank or aircraft. In case of getting spotted get in cover as fast as possible and reposition or wait until your enemy makes a mistake, like driving out into the open or getting bored and pushing or firing their cannon.\n\nThe best way to engage the enemy in this tank is to \"shoot and scoot\" since this vehicle is literally a glass cannon, concealment and cover are the JPz 4-5's best friends. Don't just play the JPz like an MBT and rush into the middle of the map, sure it's fun and you might get 1 or 2 kills but you won't survive very long. Play the JPz like the M41 before it, use your speed to get a sniping spot and move from there.\n\nPlay it in a way that you're never spotted by the enemy, because if you're seen by the enemy you are already dead.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This system would require the use of traditional tank destroyers as they were during World War II. Their role would be to provide infantry support against an armoured target with their powerful guns.\n\nHanomag and Henschel of Germany, along with MOWAG from Switzerland, developed a prototype of a vehicle able to hold the 90 mm gun commonly used in the [[M47|M47 Patton]]. The first prototype was made in 1960 and these vehicles were produced until 1967. The vehicle was known as the '''Kanonenjagdpanzer 4-5''', or shortened to '''Kanonenjagdpanzer'''. 770 were built for the Bundeswehr, West Germany's defence forces, and 80 of these produced models were also given to Belgium in April 1975.\n\n===Design===\nThe Kanonenjagdpanzer takes a huge design similarity to the [[Jagdpanzer IV]] design, with a very low profile to present itself less of a target. However, the armour is only 50 mm thick sloping, which itself is the very thing for the era the vehicle was introduced. The vehicle carries a crew of four people to perform its functions. The 90 mm gun is fixed on a casemate structure, thus it has limited traverse like traditional tank destroyer designs. Inside the vehicle, there are provisions for holding 51 rounds for the main gun, plus about 4,000 machine gun rounds for the coaxial. Aside from that, additional protection the vehicle protects is NBC protection to combat against weapons of mass destruction.\n\n===Usage===\nThe Kanonenjagdpanzer saw use in tank destroyer companies within mechanized and mountain infantry brigades of the Bundeswehr. However, the newer Soviet second-generation main battle tanks, the T-64 and the T-72, were more than capable of taking on the 90 mm gun the Kanonenjagdpanzer is equipped with, and so the Kanonenjagdpanzer was declared obsolete. The producers tried to lengthen its service life by claiming that the [[L7A1 (105 mm)|105 mm L7 gun]] can be adapted into the design, but this proved fruitless.\n\nThe Kanonenjagdpanzer, due to its obsolete status, saw more usage in specialized roles. Between 1983 and 1985, about 163 Kanonenjagdpanzer were converted into ''Raketenjagdpanzer Jaguar 2'' (not to be confused with the ''[[RakJPz 2|Raketenjagdpanzer 2]]''), a vehicle with a [[BGM-71B_TOW|TOW]] [[Anti-tank_guided_missiles|anti-tank guided missile]] on the roof. Others were converted to artillery observation vehicle named ''Beobachtungspanzer'' and served in mortar units to direct fire.\n\nThe Kanonenjagdpanzer design stayed with the Bundeswehr up until 1990, when they were formally retired from service.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe project to develop the self-propelled antitank mount was begun in the mid-1950s by specialists from the companies Hanomag (Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG)  and Henschel (Rheinstahl Henschel AG). The base selected for the new vehicle was the Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30 armoured transporter. The first prototype of the SPG with the designation Kanonenjagdpanzer 1-3 was assembled in 1959. The tests revealed significant flaws in the vehicle. As a result, more work was done to refine it. The decision was made to arm the new SPG with a 90mm antitank cannon similar to the one installed on the American M47 Patton II.\n\nBy 1961 each development company had built its own experimental model. Both models were presented for testing. After comparative testing, as well as the merger of the two companies, the decision was made to combine the efforts of the specialists from both companies in order to build a single experimental model. Work on the creation and testing of the new model continued until 1965.\n\nAfter all testing was complete in 1966 the new vehicle was accepted as part of the arsenal under the designation JPz 4-5. The SPG was built serially from 1966 to 1967. During its production the companies Hanomag and Henschel each built 385 vehicles.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_kanonenjagdpanzer Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|T4oE2ImpIf8|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|jmxOQgwtw4A|'''Jagdpanzer Kanone - KaJaPa''' - ''Olaf Kievit''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Ru 251]]\n* [[RakJPz 2]]\n* [[RakJPz 2 (HOT)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/831|[Devblog] Jagdpanzer 4-5 with developer's answers]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Kanonenjagdpanzer|[Wikipedia] Kanonenjagdpanzer]]\n\n{{Germany tank destroyers}}"}}
