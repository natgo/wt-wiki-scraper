In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.61 \"Road to Glory\"]] in the \"[[Operation S.U.M.M.E.R.]]\" event of [[wt:en/news/4151-special-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-updated-03-08-2016-en/|2016]] that lasted from 22 July to 22 August, unlocked after obtaining 36 tanker Marks of Distinction.\n\nThe KV-220 is played almost like the previous KV iterations in the Soviet heavy tank line-up. The great improvement over the predecessors is the improved all-around armour to 100 mm, meaning that the tank can angle its hull with more confidence without revealing a side weak point or the such. The great armour, decent mobility, and adequate gun gives the KV-220 a diverse role to play in, from a short-range brawler, a support tank, and a long-range sniper.\n\nThe KV-220 is quite a heavy tank of its own calibre. With 100 mm of armour all around the hull and turret, the angling of the hull can be done to maximize both front and side armour without worry of exposing weak points. Not to mention for its weight, the KV-220 is quite agile. While the 85 mm gun is powerful by its own remarks, it is inferior to the same 85 mm gun that is on the [[IS-1]] that shares the same BR as the KV-220. This is because the 85 mm on the IS has access to the more potent BR-365A and APCR shells. Thus, the KV-220 provides a heavy tank with an impressive arrangement of armour with decent mobility, but with a gun that may feel lacking in the battlefield against other heavy tanks.\n\nThere is one frontal weak point on the KV-220, and that is the gun mantlet. Not that the gun mantlet area is easy to penetrate, but that it curves downwards on the lower end of the shape. This presents a shot trap able to be exploited by any gun to ricochet a round off that and into the hull roof, which is only 30 mm thick. Do note this when facing an enemy taking aim at the tank.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

While on paper it's just like German Tiger tank, in reality it can withstand much more opponents than the Tiger. The front has 30 degree slope that makes the armour even thicker. The sides of the turret and hull are also 100 mm, making KV-220 invulnerable when facing enemies at a 45 degree angle. Due to the all around 100 mm armour, KV-220 is invulnerable to all SPAA it might see from all directions.\n\nThe KV-220 has a crew of 6, making it harder to knock out. The side of the hull is also protected with fuel tanks which can absorb large amount of damage.\n\nThe only weak spot is the gun mantlet which is 90 mm thick. Penetrating this part of armour from the front is more promising than other parts when facing the KV-220. The gun mantle is more flat compare to other parts, especially when the KV-220 is angled. It will also disable the cannon breech right behind the gun mantlet.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,097|rbMinHp=752}}\n\nThe KV-220 has a power-to-weight ratio of 13.6. But surprisingly the mobility of this tank is quite good despite the 62.7 tons of weight. The diesel engine has greater torque at lower RPM than similar gasoline engines, providing KV-220 great acceleration and higher cruise speed but lower top speed. Due to the great mobility in its class, the KV-220 can arrive at the front line with the medium tanks, holding better positions than the late-comers. Despite the good speed, its turn rate is relatively low.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|F-30 (85 mm)}}\n\nThe KV-220 carries a 85 mm F-30 cannon. The firepower is not as good as the 122 mm D-25T cannon installed on IS-2 in the similar BR, but the F-30 cannon has much better fire rate - almost three times faster. The KV-220 also have a good gun depression of -6 degrees when comparing to other soviet heavy tanks. Despite the good firing rate and relatively good gun depression angle, the F-30 cannon is still not as good as other cannons installed on heavy tanks in the similar BR. Try to treat the KV-220 as a medium tank with heavy armour rather than a one-shot-kill heavy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[F-30 (85 mm)|85 mm F-30]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It is one of the prototypes of the KV-3 tank. The design of the prototypes starts in 1940, when they designed two different designs: T-150 (or 150, Object 150, KV-150) and T-220 (or 220, Object 220, KV-220). The T-150 had thinner armour - 90 mm all around and a weaker engine. The T-150 was approved as KV-3 if it entered production. KV-220 on the other hand had thicker armour and a larger engine compared to its brother, but it also resulted in problems due to new engine and heavier weight. Also the army was not satisfied with the 85 mm F-30 cannon. The F-30 cannon was replaced by a 107 mm F-39 cannon similar to the ZIS-6 cannon on [[KV-2 (ZiS-6)]]. KV-220 entered further development as Object 221, 222 and 223 for different cannons. Only one prototype was ever built. The German invasion stopped the production of KV-3 and the development of KV-220 series.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=heavy_tank&vehicle=ussr_kv_220 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|zO-puJ00UP8|'''Using Event Tank to Get Event Tank KV 220 Still Got It''' - ''Napalmratte''|2jmWKTGXd0g|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[KV-1 (Family)]]\n* [[KV-2 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4155/current|[Devblog] KV-220]]\n* [[wikipedia:Kliment_Voroshilov_tank|[Wikipedia] Kliment Voroshilov tank]]\n* [http://pkka.narod.ru/kv-vers.htm <nowiki>[PKKA-CA]</nowiki> KV modifications.]\n\n{{USSR heavy tanks}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
