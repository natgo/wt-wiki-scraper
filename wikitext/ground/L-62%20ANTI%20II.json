In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]]. One can treat it as a sidegrade of the [[Lvtdgb m/40]], as such most of the text onward will compare them, rather than just describe this one.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nWhen one looks at the L-62 ANTI II, it's expected to have decent protection, when in reality it's armoured like the reserve tank [[Strv m/38]]. As such, its hull and the turret will only sustain rifle-calibre MG. \n\nThe gun shield is expected to protect the crew in case of a brawl with a light tank, but it's only 8 mm thick and can be penetrated by anything at point blank range. It's also way too small to protect the SPAA from any aircraft.\n\nDepending on the BR of opposing tanks, the turret crew armour may protect from enemy tanks, many rank I and II tanks can be too short to fire over it, but most of rank III tanks (which will be the norm in AB, as the {{PAGENAME}} belongs to the rank III lineup by default) will not only be too tall for it to matter, but will have HMG that can penetrate it anyway. Regardless, the turret has a lot of openings which allow any tank to decimate the entire turret crew if they try harder. The turret is also way too short and inconsistent to protect from any decent pilot and might as well not exist in case of an air strike.\n\nCompared to the Lvtdgb m/40, technically the protection is supposed to be better, but in reality it just provokes tanks to fire APHE or HE at it, immediately destroying the tank. There is also no longer a possibility to just face them with the front and to lay suppressive fire, expecting the driver cab to stop incoming attacks - the whole interior is now interconnected. But it may protect from MG in RB/SB due to the SPAA's lower BR there.\n\nTechnically, it's difficult to notice the {{PAGENAME}} as it's not a truck and looks like a tank from afar, so in RB/SB it can pass as something less dangerous to aircraft and faraway tanks until it starts to fire. In AB, its class will immediately alert everyone of what it actually does and every aircraft will immediately go after it.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was based on the Anti I, but with an improved hull and turret. It was based on the chassis of the Landsverk L-60, a light tank design made in the interwar period. The L-62 had an extra road wheel, compared to the L-60. The turret was open topped, and circular. This allowed for better visibility of planes. It was armed with the 40 mm Bofors L/60 anti-aircraft gun. Finland ordered 6 of these vehicles in 1942, and designated them as the ItPsv 41, or Ilmatorjuntapanssarivaunu 41'''.''' This translates to anti-aircraft tank 41 in English. In the Summer of 1944, the ItPsv 41 shot down 11 Soviet planes. This protected the tank brigade from air attack. All 6 vehicles were used in Finnish service until 1966.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6624-development-l-62-anti-ii-finnish-choice-en|Devblog]] ===\nDevelopment of the L-62 began in 1931, with the Landsverk company choosing to convert their L-10 light tank into an SPAA unit as part of a plan to create a range of vehicles intended for the export market. During development however, Landsverk created the more advanced L-60 tank, leading to the decision of continuing development of the L-62 on that chassis instead of the previously used L-10.\n\nThe first prototype of the L-62, named ANTI I, was built by the end of the 1930s in parallel with the L-60 then tested. While the Swedish military didn't express interest in procuring the L-62, the Hungarian military purchased the production licence for both the L-60 and L-62, resulting in the creation of the domestically produced 38M Toldi and 40M Nimród tanks, respectively.\n\nLandsverk continued developing the L-62 into the early 1940s, creating a more advanced version of the L-62 in 1941, called the ANTI II. The improved version featured a new hull and turret, as well as having its German transmission swapped out for a Swedish one.\n\nA total of six L-62 ANTI IIs were built, all of which were purchased by Finland and subsequently used in action throughout the remainder of WWII. Surviving the war, the L-62s were used as training vehicles in the postwar period and right up until their retirement in 1966.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_l_62_anti_II Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:L-62 Anti II WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:L-62 Anti II WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:L-62 Anti II WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:L-62 Anti II WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:L-62 Anti II WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:L-62 Anti II WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6624-development-l-62-anti-ii-finnish-choice-en|[Devblog] L-62 ANTI II: Finnish Choice]]\n\n=== References ===\n;Bibliography\n* Landsverk L-62 Anti-II.
