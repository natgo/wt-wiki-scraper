If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n;Combat tactics\n\nThe L6/40 possesses a level of versatility which allows it to play in a variety of roles with varying efficiency. As a frontline tank, one must maintain a short engagement distance (up to 200 m if possible) and exploit its small size to hide in almost all types of cover. The autocannon's efficiency will allow the player to dispatch of most enemies even frontally, and can knock out cannon barrels and tracks if it is unable to.\n\nFlanking is another way to best use the tank's advantages. It is relatively mobile and the autocannon will be more reliable against the side armour of the enemy vehicles. Additionally, by flanking, one will artificially increase the L6/40's survivability, as it is not going to be the main target of fire in the initial stages of the player's ambush. This removes the reliance on the protection which, as previously mentioned, is not an aspect that will consistently save it.\n\nPlaying at range and sniping is almost pointless as the armament quickly loses penetration over range and struggles to penetrate even lightly armoured opponents.\n\nWhichever playstyle one chooses, it is important to always play to the strengths of the vehicle, mainly the automatic armament and reactive turret traverse speed.\n\n;Notable enemies\n\n* Heavily armoured tanks that can negate the 20 mm rounds such as the [[FCM.36]], [[S.35]], and [[Valentine Mk I]].\n* Tanks with sloped armour that can ricochet the rounds such as the [[H.39]], [[T-60]], [[T-70]], or [[T-80]].\n\n;How to defeat a L6/40\n\nStay at a distance of at least 500 m to negate its firepower. If the L6/40's armour profile is unangled, fire at the front plate underneath the turret to guarantee the incapacitation of the crew. If the tank is heavily angled, a shot into the very thin side armour will likely penetrate. Finally, if the L6/40 is adequately angled and neither the front nor side can be penetrated, the player's best shot is to fire at the corner plate between the front and side, which normalizes upon angling. This is one's only chance to fire at a flat plate in this situation.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Potent armament with good penetration and damage output\n* Great turret rotation\n* Good acceleration\n* Adequate mobility\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Poor suspension damping, it takes about 2 seconds to settle after stopping the vehicle\n* Limited crew of 2\n* Low rate of fire\n* Limited magazines of 8 rounds\n* Hull side can be penetrated by 0.50 cal machine guns\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This L6/40 would also provide protection to key infrastructure in captured Yugoslavian territory. The Italian army would operate up to 55 units of this vehicle in that theatre. This L6/40 has a Lion painted on it, which acted as a sort of mascot for troops stationed there. After the armistice most of the units operating there would be taken by the German army.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[L6/40]]\n* [[L3/33 CC]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/413285-carro-armato-l640/\n\n{{TankManufacturer FIAT-Ansaldo}}\n{{Italy light tanks}}\n{{Italy premium ground vehicles}}"}}
