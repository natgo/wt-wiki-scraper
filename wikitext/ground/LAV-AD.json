It was introduced in [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\nThe LAV-AD's mobility is rather superb. As a wheeled vehicle, it has good speed on roads. Despite being similar in appearance and having a weaker engine than the [[M1128]], the LAV-AD accelerates much faster due to its lighter weight, resulting in a higher power-to-weight ratio, and it also has a slightly faster reverse speed. The engine is also relatively quiet, allowing for stealthy movements and ambushes.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=391|rbMinHp=243}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|4}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|GAU-12U (25 mm)}}\n\nThe main armament of the LAV-AD is the 25 mm GAU-12U rotary autocannon. It functions similarly to the 20 mm [[M168 (20 mm)|M168]] Vulcan found on the [[M163]] earlier on in the tech tree, but with a reduced ammo capacity of only 1,000 rounds total (500 ready, 500 reserve instead of 1,100 ready, 1,100 reserve) and fire rate (1,800 rpm instead of 3,000 rpm) due to the limited room in the vehicle and larger calibre ammunition. The gun is also fully stabilized, with handling akin to that of the [[HSTV-L]]; slower than the [[M163]] and [[M247]] Sergeant York but still fast enough to react to most aerial targets at close range, particularly helicopters and slow, low-flying jets. Like most other AAs, it comes with a Default, AP, and HE belt. The Default belt has a 1:1 AP to HE ratio and is the only belt the vehicle has access to when stock. The HE belt has a 3:1 HE to AP ratio while the AP belt has a 3:1 AP to HE ratio. The former is more effective against aircraft while the latter is more effective against armoured vehicles. The AP round is the same across all belts, and can penetrate 91 mm of armour at point blank range. Combined with the relatively high fire rate, it can easily destroy barrels, tracks, and machine guns with ease as well as being able to shred light vehicles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[GAU-12U (25 mm)|25 mm GAU-12U]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

This modification gives the vehicle an additional weapon set-up, replacing the Stinger pod above the main gun with a Hydra 70 rocket pod with 19 rockets, similar to those found on [[AH-1 (Family)|AH-1 Cobras]] and [[AH-64 (Family)|AH-64 Apaches]].

The missiles are IR guided, meaning they require a lock-on before firing. The vehicle has FIM-92Es by default and can unlock FIM-92Ks as a later modification. These are the same Stinger missiles used by the [[Ozelot]] in the German tech tree and function the same way. The missiles are launched as special weapons.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missile || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Both companies began developing a system based on the USMC requirements that it had to be armed with a 25 mm cannon and possess provisions for mounting Stinger missiles and Hydra-70 rockets. While the FMC company opted to outfit their design with the same M242 cannon used on the base model of the LAV-25, General Electric decided to go for the GAU-12 'Equalizer' Gatling style rotary cannon.\n\nHaving reviewed both prototypes, the USMC decided to procure General Electric's design, placing an initial order for 125 vehicles to be produced. By 1996, the LAV-AD had formally been adopted into service. Despite the initial plans to produce over 100 vehicles, only 17 were actually manufactured due to funding issues. In 1998, the final unit was delivered to the USMC and further development of the vehicle was discontinued due to high maintenance costs. Among other operations, the LAV-AD was used in combat action in Iraq.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|QvGHPYrGrXU|'''The Shooting Range #301''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:27 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7598-development-lav-ad-revolving-firepower-en|[Devblog] LAV-AD: Revolving Firepower]]\n\n{{USA anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
