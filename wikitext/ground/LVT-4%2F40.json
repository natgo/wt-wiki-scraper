These, along with other armored vehicles, were supplied to France as a short-term solution to rebuild the French military after the war. During the Indochina War of the early 1950's, LVTs in French service were modified to carry the 40 mm Bofors anti-air gun as it proved to be more effective against ground targets than the standard 37 mm cannon. These modified French LVTs also participated in the Suez Crisis of 1956, which also marked their final operational use.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/7384-development-battle-pass-vehicles-lvt-4-40-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_lvt_bofors Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Wa5gx59a7RY|'''Should You buy The LVT-4/40? - Vehicle Review''' - ''Sako Sniper''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7384-development-battle-pass-vehicles-lvt-4-40-en|[Devblog] Battle Pass Vehicles: LVT-4/40]]\n\n{{France light tanks}}\n{{France premium ground vehicles}}"}}
