In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"New Power\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Leclerc S2 is virtually the same inside as the S1, excluding a few upgrades not functional in-game such as a new NBC protection system and air conditioner. The turret cheeks (>600 mm KE) are well protected, with the middle glacis plate providing 720 mm chemical and 550 mm kinetic protection. The flat plate below the gunner's thermal optic provides 500 mm of protection against KE.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front !! Sides !! Rear !!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=2,285|rbMinHp=1,304}}\n\nThe Leclerc S2 is powered by the same engine as the S1, the Wärtsilä V8X-1500. Outputting 1,475 hp and using a special gas turbine turbocharger (which can also act as the vehicle's APU, and eliminating turbo lag), the Leclerc S2 has great mobility for its class at 26.25 hp/ton. However, it weighs 2.5t more than the S1 which makes for noticeable sluggishness without engine upgrades.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|GIAT CN120-26 F1 (120 mm)}}\n\nLike its predecessor, the Leclerc S2 is equipped with the CN120-26 F1 L/52 cannon. It can fire three shells: a stock HEATFS round, and two APFSDS shells. The OFL 120 F1, which shares the same penetrator as the DM43, slices through over 550 mm of armour past 1 km. Although this isn't as competitive as some contemporaries, it still performs very well against enemy MBTs. The 120 F1 shell also has a velocity of 1,790 m/s which makes for very good ballistics and low bullet drop. Although powerful, the 120 F1 round is a Tier IV modification; like most other MBTs, the Leclerc starts out with a stock HEATFS shell. Although powerful against light vehicles and SPAA, the HEATFS is redundant against your opponents. You have an APFSDS shell as a Tier I modification, however, one must note that it penetrates only 425 mm of armour even at close range.\n\nUnlike most of its Western contemporaries (excluding the [[Type 90]] and the [[CV 90120]]), the Leclerc S2 is equipped with an autoloader. This gives it a steady rate of fire of 6 seconds, tied with an aced crew level of the M1A2 Abrams and the Leopard 2. This gives it great follow-up shot potential out of the box without the need for crew upgrading. Also equipped with powerful thermals for the gunner, the Leclerc can pick off unsuspecting targets with great efficiency.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[GIAT CN120-26 F1 (120 mm)|120 mm GIAT CN120-26 F1]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nWith great mobility and an autoloading 120 mm cannon, the Leclerc can be exploited to fulfil a number of roles on the battlefield. Mobility enables it to get into competitive spots for sniping or ambushing, and the gun's performance enables quick response and follow-up shots to any enemy that appears. Its survivability is best while hull down or poking out from a hill, as most of its vulnerable areas excluding the cannon breech (and sometimes the LFP when poking out from cover) are hidden well enough. Try to avoid close quarters combat (CQC) as the Leclerc's numerous hull weak spots can be easily seen and targeted in urban environments. If CQC is inevitable (i.e. Rhine, Sweden, Novorossiysk), then the Leclerc can be used to ambush distracted tanks and poke out of cover. When shot at or damaged, use your smoke grenades to retreat into cover. 14 smoke grenades give two separate discharges, or if discharged all at once, provide 360 degrees of smoke for you to retreat behind.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* The OFL 120 F1 APFSDS round is effective\n* Autoloader allows for consistent reloads\n* Competitive mobility and great reverse speed\n* Has 2nd generation thermals for the gunner\n* Large first-stage ammo stowage\n* Lower profile compared to its contemporaries\n* Relatively fast gun elevation/depression speeds\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* No thermal optics for commander\n* Noticeable weak spots at close range or when not hull down\n* Cannon breech is easy to hit at any range\n* 10 mm armour protection for the engine: 12.7 mm rounds can set afire and immobilize you\n* Only three crew members\n* Abysmal performance when stock\n* Heavier than the Leclerc S1 - slightly reduced mobility and acceleration\n* Mantlet can easily be penetrated, even by lower tier guns and at distance - the mantlet is hard to hide\n* Lower frontal plate does not have any composites, meaning a penetration on the front is mostly incapacitating or downright lethal\n* Slower than average turret traverse rate\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

It featured an increase on the commander's optic periscope armour to STANAG 3. Air conditioner was added as well as lockable baskets and boxes on the turret's bustle. A wave deflector was added at the frontal plate as well as addition of one piece rubber plating on side skirts. Later models of the S2, more specifically the Leclerc S2T9, were retrofitted with V5 tracks instead of V2 tracks as well as a new General Purpose Sight (gunner's optics) at the end of their life service in order to standardise them for further Leclerc Série 3 also known as SXXI.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_leclerc_s2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|aIdifrVolXY|'''Lethal Leclerc: Leclerc S2 Review''' - ''Sako Sniper''|I55DedeKDdg|'''Leclerc S2 - Fantastic 4K French Performance''' - ''Napalmratte''|4WFrgIeVpvk|'''The Balanced Baguette S2 - Leclerc S2''' - ''JustinPlaysYT''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Nexter}}\n{{France medium tanks}}"}}
