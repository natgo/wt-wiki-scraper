In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 \"Locked On\"]].\n\nThe succeeding variant of the [[Leopard 2A4]], the {{PAGENAME}} is distinguished by an overall improved turret front armour, most notably with the add-on armour bulks in the turret front, giving a wedge-shape rather than the flat shapes that the 2A4 variant presented.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has improved armour compared to its predecessor, the hull is much better protected and the already impenetrable turret cheeks have more protection on the side of the turret. Add-on armour boosts the ability to protect against HEAT-FS and early APFSDS rounds. The wedges on the front of the turret are able to be blown off if a round with enough energy hits it.The gunners optic is also moved into the roof to eliminate the weak spot which was easily penetrated by any tank.\n\nOne big changeover along with the armour wedges in the front is the repositioning of the gunner's sight. In the 2A4, the gunner's sight in the turret front presented a weakness that was easily compromised. In the 2A5, the gunner's sight was relocated to the turret roof, and so this weakness is no longer present on the 2A5. Additionally, the large mantlet of the 2A4 has been replaced by a far smaller and more armoured mantlet, making it far harder to hit, though most ammunition at top tier can still penetrate it easily.\n\nBe aware of Soviet tanks though! Most of them will carry their HE rounds that can easily destroy you anywhere they hit. A hit directly to the turret will most likely send fragments into your hull, penetrate and lets your fuel tank explode or at least set a fire and knock out the gun barrel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

With these new changes, the playstyle changes a bit too:\n\n* ''Hull down'': In the 2A4, the gunners optic was easily penetrated so the hull-down was still vulnerable. However, in the 2A5, this weak spot is eliminated and the armour of the turret is much better, so a hull-down position can now leave the {{PAGENAME}} invulnerable, but try to keep your turret protected as well, so then the armour package could last longer throughout the battle.\n* ''Sniping'': With the DM53 APFSDS round, the {{PAGENAME}} can now make use of the great distance in combat to deal damage while tanking incoming shots. Try also make use of hull-down positions whilst sniping.\n* ''Flanking'': Due to the worse mobility compared to the 2A4, it is better to stick to more stationary tactics like ''hull-down'' and ''sniping''. However, with a little bit of caution, flanking can still be successful.\n* ''Staying with nearby teammates:'' Try and stick to nearby teammates as this can improve your lifespan throughout the game.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The longer L/55 cannon on the Leopard 2A6 increases the performance of both DM33 and DM53 shells.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Improvements were made to the tank's defensive capabilities, primarily the turret armour. Moreover, the 2A5 model was fitted with an electric stabiliser instead of the electro-hydraulic variant that the previous versions used.\n\nThe gunner received improved and less vulnerable optics, and the tank commander – a panoramic periscope with thermal imaging. The build of the driver's hatch was also modified, along with several other minor improvements made to the general design.\n\nLeading to the 2A5 modernization program being officially approved by the military officials of Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. It is interesting to note that the models exported to the last two countries on the list were actually different from the ones issued to the German army – for instance, the Bundeswehr tanks received no extra frontal hull armour. Production of {{PAGENAME}} tanks began in 1995. Overall, 350 earlier-version Leopards were upgraded as a result of the program.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6098-development-leopard-2a5-this-time-we-are-dead-serious-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_leopard_2a5 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|5WHTEcO9zKo|'''German Efficiency Continued - Leopard 2A5''' - ''JustinPlaysYT''|xCV32NWy8Kc|'''Should You Grind The Leopard 2A5?''' - ''Sako Sniper''|Htx2jqp0aEA|'''German ground forces Tier VI/VII''' - ''Oxy'' (Leopard 2A5 at 27:52)|efyCTykFiO0|'''Leopard 2A5 - Much WoW, Such GooD''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n[[File:GarageImage_Leopard_2A5_Cup.png|300px|thumb|right|␙Leopard 2A5, currently only owned by content creator Slickbee]]\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Leopard 2A4]] - <small>(Preceding vehicle)</small>\n* ␙Leopard 2A5 - <small>([[wt:en/news/6286-esport-war-thunder-youtube-cup-results-en|YouTube Cup 2019]] prize)</small>\n* [[Strv 122A]]\n* [[Strv 122B PLSS]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6098-development-leopard-2a5-this-time-we-are-dead-serious-en|[Devblog] Leopard 2A5: This Time We Are Dead Serious]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer KMW}}\n{{Germany medium tanks}}"}}
