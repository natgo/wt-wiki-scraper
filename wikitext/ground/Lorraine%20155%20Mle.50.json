In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened as '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating|1}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 \"Advancing Storm\"]] as a reward during the [[wt:en/news/5453-special-chronicles-of-world-war-ii-in-war-thunder-en|2018 WW2 Chronicles]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has very little armour (although some are sloped enough to deflect certain low-calibre rounds), and can generally be penetrated by most guns of its rank. Even worse, however, the 'casemate' (if it can even be called that) has very little armour, and in some places can be shot through with machine guns. The machine-gunner (operating the 20 mm gun) is completely standing in the open. Generally, you want to rely on good map placement and mobility, rather than armour.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, superstructure)\n* Wheel (tires)\n* Structural steel (gun mount, gun breech, mudguards)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Use it sparsely because of its low ammo count. When losing a crew member, the machine gunner is used to replace other crew members, meaning that you can't use the 20 mm cannon anymore.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe best method of using the large-calibre weapon on the Loraine is to exploit the high-explosive power against thin-armour on the enemy. Like other large calibre HE tanks, shooting below an enemy vehicle will penetrate its belly armor. This is an effective, albeit difficult way to engage tanks whose armor is greater than what your HE shell can penetrate.\n\nSome targets to keep in mind of, and their weak points:\n\n* Tiger I - While seemingly a hard enemy to face, the Tiger is easily dispatched with a side shot. A hit to the roadwheels will penetrate the tank, with the shell fragments going through the thin armor on the underside of the tank's sponson. This is also possible to do to Tiger IIs, but usually results in much less damage done.\n* Tiger II P, Panthers D and A - a hit to the bottom of the curved turret face of these tanks will cause the HE shell to pen the roof of the vehicle. This can also be done on tanks with flat turret fronts ( Tiger I, Tiger II H, Panthers G and F) by aiming for the lower half of the turret, but is not as reliable.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Powerful 155 mm gun with a HE shell on-par with the KV-2's gun\n* Pintle-mounted 20 mm cannon that is deadly to lightly-armoured vehicles and aircraft\n* Decent mobility\n* Good reverse speed\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Thin armor with an open casemate, allows even rifle-calibre rounds to affect the crew\n* Despite thin armor, it's thick enough to trigger most fuses in APHE shells\n* Large profile\n* Long reload time; increases if the loader is taken out\n* If the machine-gunner is knocked out, so is the ability to use the 20 mm cannon\n* No AP shells, only HE shells\n* Bad gun depression of 5°\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
