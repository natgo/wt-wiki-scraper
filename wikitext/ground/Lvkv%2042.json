In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\n'''{{Specs|name}}''' (English: ''anti air cannon wagon 42''), or '''lvkv 42''' for short, is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]]. Number 42 in its name indicates that it is the second \"lvkv\"-SPAA that uses 40 mm weaponry (4 = 40 mm, 2 = 2nd).\n\nThe lvkv 42 was developed by the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors on request from the Swedish army as a 1950s next generation Swedish SPAA following the 1940s limited production lvkv fm/43 SPAA. Two prototypes based on a new original chassis-design were built and delivered for testing late December 1953 and early January 1954 respectively after various delays. In the end the project was scrapped as SPAAs with integrated radars became more necessary.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members.
