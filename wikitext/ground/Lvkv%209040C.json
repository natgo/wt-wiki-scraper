In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]]. Its name translates directly to \"Air Defense Scan Carriage\".\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\nThe Armor of the {{PAGENAME}} is best considered to be non-existent. This turns out to work to its benefit however, as the lack of armor can often prevent the vehicle from being outright destroyed upon a first strike, leaving the player a few seconds to retaliate. The turret, hull, and front upper plate all boast a few mm of composite armor which does help against smaller caliber machine guns, however you are still very vulnerable to enemy CAS, IFVs, and MBTs. \n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: *Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Cupola roof)\n* Composite screen (Hull front, Hull sides, Turret front\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Fire in short bursts to avoid spooking the pilot/tanker and conserve ammunition\n* While reloading the magazine it will be an easy prey for enemy air units\n* The HE-VT shell is a tier II modification\n* The stock HE shell needs a direct hit on an aerial vehicle to destroy it - smart pilots know not to fly in a straight line, making it very difficult to take them down\n* Doesn't have SAMs so can't engage helicopters at long ranges\n* An easy target for enemy helicopters with long range Vikhr and Hellfire ATGMs\n* Does not get access to the scouting abilities the Strf 9040C and [[Strf 9040 BILL]] have\n* Rather slow turret traverse\n* No CITV\n* 40 mm HE-VT is rather weak - multiple hits are required to down an enemy aircraft\n* 40 mm HE-VT needs to travel a certain distance to activate the fuse - helicopters at close range require a direct hit to take down\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
