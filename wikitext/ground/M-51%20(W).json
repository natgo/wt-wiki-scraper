World War II surplus early-model [[M4|M4 Sherman]] tanks, many of them already rendered combat-ineffective, were purchased from any European source that would provide them. A significant Israeli repair effort finally managed to get most of these tanks working in time to defeat the invading armoured battalions, ultimately winning the war. The basic M4 remained the IDF's primary tank for more than half a decade, precisely because it was considered obsolete everywhere else and could therefore be purchased en-masse at scrapyard prices. During the early 1950s it was slowly replaced with more advanced Sherman models, whenever those could be acquired.\n\nUnfortunately for the IDF, this situation could not continue for long. Newfound cooperation between the Arab states and the Soviet Union resulted in an influx of [[T-34-85]]s into the region, whose armour was very difficult to penetrate using the M4's original [[M3 (75 mm)|75 mm M3]] cannon. It was obvious that the Shermans would need to be replaced in order to keep up with the arms race. Initially, the IDF considered purchasing the new [[AMX-13]] from France (which was rapidly becoming Israel's primary weapon supplier), but the tank was determined to be too lightly armoured. Instead, a number of French CN-75-50 cannons (also known as the [[SA50 L/57 (75 mm)|SA50 L/57]]) were purchased separately and installed into the turrets of existing [[M4A4 (France)|M4A4 Shermans]]. This resulted in the Sherman M-50, known abroad as the \"Super Sherman\" and in War Thunder as the [[M4A4 (SA50)]].\n\nThe M-50s proved highly effective during the Sinai War of 1956, but the lessons of that war resulted in the Soviets flooding the region - particularly Egypt and Syria - with the newest [[T-54/55 (Family)|T-54/55]], armed with a 100 mm cannon and carrying more modern curved armour. Once again, new French [[AMX-30]]s were rejected as replacements for the M-50, but their new [[CN-105-F1 (105 mm)|CN-105-F1 105 mm]] cannons proved quite suitable for the IDF's purposes. The Israelis modified these cannons to their own specifications, slightly reducing barrel length and muzzle velocity as well as fitting the cannon with a brand new muzzle brake. This modified cannon would be installed on an [[M4A1]] Sherman hull fitted with a T23 turret (the turret originally used for 76 mm Sherman variants). The tank was then fitted with a number of additional modernization features, including infrared spotlights and a better fire control system.\n\nThis new model was dubbed the Sherman M-51, of which 180 were constructed in total. They first saw action during the Six-Day War of 1967, where they often outmatched Syrian and Egyptian T-55s. In combat in the West Bank during that war, the M-51 exceeded expectations even further by thoroughly defeating Jordanian [[M48A1|M48 Pattons]] - very similar to the model that was in the process of replacing the M-51 in IDF service at the time. Despite becoming effectively obsolete by the 1970s, the M-51s were called back into action in 1973 during the desperate situation of the Yom Kippur War, and reportedly managed to hold their own even against late-model [[T-62]] tanks.\n\nAll in all, the M-51 is considered to be the last and most advanced version of the Sherman ever produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=il_m_51_w Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|jyKHrTMSd1o|'''Should You Buy The M-51? - Vehicle Review''' - ''Sako Sniper''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[M4 Sherman (Family)]]\n** [[M-51]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7483-development-shop-israeli-ground-forces-cbt-early-access-packs-en|[Devblog] Israeli Ground Forces CBT Early Access Packs!]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Israeli Ordnance Corps}}\n{{Israel medium tanks}}\n{{Israel premium ground vehicles}}"}}
