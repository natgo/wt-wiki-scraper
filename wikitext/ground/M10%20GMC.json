In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (or the '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''', unofficially the ''Wolverine'') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.49 \"Weapons of Victory\"]].\n\nThe M10 GMC (Gun Motor Carriage) takes much from the [[M4A2|M4A2 Sherman]] which it was derived from. The drivetrain is identical with the drive shaft running from the engine in the rear to the front transmission and sprockets. The hull is sloped to a larger degree. The [[M7 (76 mm)|3-inch (76 mm) cannon]] originally mounted on the experimental M6 Heavy Tank lacks the muzzle brake of the 76 mm M1A2 gun used on the later Rank III Sherman's and the M18 Hellcat. The turret is a pentagonal shaped M5 Mount type.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n*Rolled homogeneous armour\n*Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Transmission area)\n*Structural steel (Counterweight)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The thickest part of the front hull is the 51 mm lower plate and the upper plate is 38 mm, though both are sloping at 55 degrees from vertical. The sides and back are only 19 mm slightly angled and thus can be penetrated by most weapons stronger than a 12.7 mm machine gun. This fact is made worse by the positioning of ammo racks on the sides, making it easy to one-shot the M10 with a side penetration. The turret has slightly better armour with the gun mantlet having 57 mm angled at 45 degrees on the front, but it is still very weak on the sides and back. The front of the turret can often eat shells as the shell will fragment on the initial armour, and the massive breech of the 76mm cannon will often absorb most if not all of the spalling, leaving the turret crew untouched. This will take the M10 out of combat, but when backed up by team-mates it is possible to reverse away to repair. The turrets top is exposed and because of that artillery barrages and HE shells are much more lethal to the crew. One should avoid angling the armour a great degree as it may expose the weaker side armour at a more perpendicular angle.\n\nFor those fighting the M10 from the front, firing towards the upper left side of the hull glacis (towards the right from the firing perspective) will be able to knock out both the driver and/or gunner if the shot penetrates in the right angle. If this does not completely destroy the tank, it certainly has crippled it and the follow-up shot should go towards the opposite side to knock out the rest of the crew. Repeat if necessary in cases where the crews are still active inside the tank. It is also a good idea to shoot the bottom of the hull to disable the transmission if the M10 is trying to flee. Since the M10 is an open-topped tank destroyer, overpressure from HE rounds will have no problem dealing with the entire crew in a single shot, as long as the round hits the M10. When using HE against the front of the M10, aim center mass, as that will give you the strongest possibility of hitting it.\n\nThe M10's side is lined with ammo racks and it's extremely easy to one-shot the tank. Simply aim below the turret, shoot the side and the ammo should explode in a blaze of glory. If the ammo does not explode the first time, then try shooting the same spot again or aim more to the front of the hull to knock out any remaining crew. It is possible to blow up the fuel tanks or set it on fire by shooting the rear of the M10, the worse case at least the engine will be disabled.\n\nThere is not a whole lot of places to shoot at the back of the M10, though a shot at the turret can knock out the turret crew or a shot in the hull can cripple the engine. Two ammo racks are present at the rear of the turret, but these racks are most likely empty as 1) They are the first two to run dry and 2) Players will usually keep this empty with reduced ammo load. The best place to shoot in the rear would be the engine to immobilize the M10 and potentially set it on fire.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=582|rbMinHp=363|AoAweight=0.5}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has roughly the same mobility characteristics as the M4 Sherman. Spaded, the tank moves surprisingly fast in a straight line, but the turning speed is a bit sluggish as well as the reverse speed. The {{PAGENAME}} struggles while driving on inclines due to its narrow tracks. All in all the {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility is moderate and it can get to its location reasonably fast.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nFirst off get all protection modifications: ''Parts'' and ''FPE''. After that move on to research modifications from the Firepower tree: ''Horizontal Drive'', ''Adjustment of Fire'', and the ''Elevation Mechanism''. Lastly research the Mobility tree: ''Tracks'', ''Filters'', ''Engine'', ''Transmission'', ''Suspension'', ''Brake System''.\n\nThough the ''M79 shot'' stock is an available module in the modifications, it can be at the bottom of prioritization as it currently possess no advantage over the stock M62 shell, having the same shell velocity but with worse penetration at all distances and angles, shallower ricochet angle, higher shell cost.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|M7 (76 mm)}}\n\nThe 3-inch (76 mm) cannon is a wonderful and powerful gun. APCBC ammo can penetrate any tank on the battlefield even from long range. The M10 also has access to an unlockable AP round, but it does not offer any advantages over the stock APCBC shell and so generally should not be used. It is not a bad idea to carry a few HE shells as well to fight lightly armoured and open top tanks like the [[M16_MGMC|M16 SPAA]]. The powerful gun and potent ammunition make the M10 a good sniper vehicle at its battle rating, especially with its -10° gun depression, giving the M10 the ability to maximize a hull-down position. Unfortunately, even though this tank destroyer does feature a turret, its turret rotation speed is extremely slow (< 4.0°/s) due to its historic configuration of only possessing a hand crank for the turret traverse. It is possible to crest a ridge and watch as the enemy rotates their turret, takes aim, and shoots the M10, all while the latter is rotating its turret into position. Thus, it is better to see it as a regular fragile SPG instead of a turreted SPG and fight from a distance and in possible concealment. Take warning that the gun's excellent penetration is too much for lower rank tanks and can lead to over-penetration, thus dealing less or even no damage to the enemy. Also, start each round with at least six missing shells (as detailed in the [[#Ammo_racks|Ammo Racks]] section) to remove the ammo racks on the rear of the turret, reducing turret penetration vulnerability to an instant cook-off.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[M7 (76 mm)|76 mm M7]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe M10 is a support vehicle. Find a good sniping position and lay behind the team taking out enemy tanks from a distance. Try to stay away from enemy tanks to avoid getting destroyed quickly. To make full use of its decent sniping capacity, find a spot that:\n\n* overlooks key passageway / street / battle area\n* is not too close to the frontline\n* has slopes, hard covers or bushes\n* is not too hard to get to\n\nWith a location like that, the M10 can utilise its -10° gun depression and use hull down. Its turret front and mantlet can consistently cause ricochets especially in a downtier. Looming behind bushes, an M10's well aimed shots should be able to knock out most enemy tanks at the battle-rating range from long range. Even if you get spotted, any slope or hard covers will provide protection for you.\n\nIf fighting in a close quarter's environment, do not try to push forward without support. Stay behind friendly tanks in order to support them without being shot at. If in an urban scenario on maps like [[Poland_(Ground_Forces)|Poland]] or [[Normandy (Ground Forces)|Normandy]], utilize the tank's turning speed to rotate the turret to the right angle. But, the best option is still to find a hull down location. For example, in [[Normandy (Ground Forces)|Normandy]], during arcade, the best location is towards the C point, where there are hills and dips that can be used to hide the hull, while giving a good view of the battlefield.\n\nThe M10 has a very slow turret rotation speed, but the M10 can traverse faster than it can rotate its turret and use its high speed when at high gear to produce some interesting skids via the physics engine to swerve the M10 and angle its gun at an enemy tank around the corner. It is recommended to understand and get a good feel of the M10's mobility and horsepower on dirt and paved roads before attempting this stunt. The low turret rotation speed means that a M10 player must always be aware of where the enemy tanks are, because they will not be able to turn the turret quickly if the enemy is able to flank the M10. In addition, the M10's side armour is weak, and the ammunition storage is in the hull sides, so if the enemy is able to shoot the M10 at that location, it is very likely to explode the ammo rack and destroy the tank with one shot.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n[[R3 T20 FA-HS]]: this vehicle is the exact opposite tank when comparing to an M10: extremely high topspeed, great traverse and fast gun rotation. A well-maneuvered R3 can easily circle around the M10 and shoot AP shells through the thin side, while the M10 struggles to get the gun on target even when traversing the hull with the gun. If you know an R3 is around, you better turn your hull towards the possible direction and be ready to engage. Move the hull with the gun to target quicker. Even if you miss, the M2 Browning can still penetrate the R3 and knock out its crews. Note that a side shot on the R3 does not guarantee a kill as the fuse might not get triggered, and the crew are pretty separated. The R3 can run away and repair for another attack. A frontal shot, however, is likely to one shot it as the crew are all lined up.\n\n[[8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl.]]: also known as the \"flak truck\", it is rather hard to knock out due to the fact that its armor is so thin that almost every shell will over-penetrate, dealing almost no critical damage. Plus this vehicle mostly face their side to the targets, making it even harder to kill them as the crew are all far apart. So it can usually take quite some hits and take out the shooters one by one. As the shooter, aim for the left side of its turret first to disable its gunner first, then knock out the rest of its crew (right turret & driving compartment). Do not hope that the M2 HB can kill the crews, the \"flak truck\" 's armor is too thick for any MG to penetrate.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Also the huge, V-shaped gun mantlet can often bounce / absorb shells (eg. 75 mm M3 and 76 mm F-34 / ZIS-5), as well as the large gun breech behind it further protecting the turret crew\n* 5 crew members to replace 3 incapacitated crew members, plus one more with [[Crew Replenishment]] modification\n* Storage bustle on the rear of the turret helps protect it by absorbing shots aimed at it\n* Turreted purpose-built tank destroyer allows for a wide field of fire compared to casemate designs\n* Powerful roof-mounted [[M2HB (12.7 mm)|M2 Browning]] can damage light vehicles ([[R3 T20 FA-HS]])or low flying aircraft well\n* A lot of camouflages to unlock with relative ease\n* Access to modification \"[[Add-on Armor|Add-on Armour]]\", that increases hull protection significantly on the sides and front\n* Has relatively no problem when getting up-tiered\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Very poor turret traverse speed combined with its rather sluggish hull traverse \"locks\" it as a long range sniper for most players- close quarters combat is difficult and great situational awareness is required, as it often cannot get its gun on target in time\n* Base armour is quite thin, can get easily penetrated by common opponents like the [[Pz.IV F2]] or StuG III F/G\n* Open topped, vulnerable to aircraft strafing. Watch out for any IL-2 or Hs-129 B2\n* Poor reverse speed can sometimes get the player killed\n* Only x3.5 gunsight zoom making it hard to shoot distant targets\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The first few vehicles produced on this concept was the ''37 mm GMC M6'' and the ''[[M3 GMC|75 mm GMC M3]]''. While adequate, these were only seen as a stop-gap measure until better tank destroyers could be developed.<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\">Zaloga 2002</ref><ref name=\"ZalogaM18\">Zaloga 2004</ref> With requests being sent for a 3-inch Gun Motor Carriage (GMC), a proposal was made in November 1941 for a turreted tank destroyer that would use the chassis of [[M4A2]] Sherman and armed with the 3-inch gun from the [[M6A1|M6 heavy tank]]. The resulting prototype was standardized in June 1942 as the '''3-inch Gun Motor Carriage M10''' in June 1942.<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\" />\n\nProduction started on the M10s in September 1942 at Fisher Tank Arsenal at Grand Blanc, Michigan with a production priority rating much higher than even the new M4 medium tank. Due to the concerns of not meeting production demands, a separate variant developed on the [[M4A3_(76)_W|M4A3]] chassis as the ''M10A1''. Production of these two vehicles would run until December 1943 (M10) and January 1944 (M10A1) for a total production number of 6,706 vehicle produced, 4,993 M10s and 1,713 M10A1s.<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\" />\n\nToday, the M10 is often referred to as the ''\"Wolverine\"''. However, the origin of this nickname is unknown. Some have contested that it was a British nickname, but it is unlikely as they gave it the designation [[Achilles|\"Achilles\"]]. It also is not an American nickname as well as all official documents referred to the M10's by their designation or \"TD\". It is widely accepted that \"Wolverine\" is a post-war nickname similar to the \"Hetzer\" nickname on the [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)]].<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\" />\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe M10 received their baptism of fire in Tunisia, with the Tank Destroyer putting their doctrine into practice at the Battle of El Guettar on 23 March 1943 against the 10th Panzer Division. Afterwards, the Allies found themselves on the offensive while large-scale German armoured punches became sporadic and scarce. Discontent with valuable guns and vehicles being left in reserves, a tactic was devised by Lt.Col. James Barney of the 776th to use the M10 in an artillery role with their 3-inch guns, a role the M10 found itself in during the fighting in Italy.<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\" />\n\nThe M10 was also deployed as the standard equipment in 11 Tank Destroyer battalions during Operation Overlord, serving alongside [[M18 GMC|M18 ''Hellcats'']] and towed guns in the same tank destroyer role. Due to once again the armour engagements in Normandy and the rest of France to being scarce, the M10 found themselves supporting infantry advances into German territory. In July, encounters with [[Panther G|Panther tanks]] shocked the tank destroyer crew as there was a belief the armaments were capable of easily dealing with the new German tanks, and complaints were made for the fielding of a better gun on the field. The solution came in the form of the [[M36 GMC|M36 ''Jackson'']] with a 90 mm cannon and the T4 HVAP ammo for the 3-inch gun.<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\" />\n\nTowards the end of 1944, the German Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) caused the M10 and the other employed tank destroyers to face off once again against a dedicated armoured punch of Panthers and [[Tiger II (H)|Tiger II]] tanks. During this campaign, a deception mission was launched by the Germans named ''Operation Grief'', which had ten [[Ersatz M10|Panther tanks dressed up to look like M10s]] externally to fool Americans.<ref name=\"HartPanther\">Hart 2003</ref> All of these mock-ups were destroyed by battle or scrapped after it. After the Battle of the Bulge, the majority of German armoured forces have dwindled and armour engagements largely declined in the final months of the war in Europe.<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\" /> One of the M10's most notable action in 1945 was done on January 26 in the Colmar Pocket when the most decorated soldier of World War II, Audie Murphy, used a knocked out M10's M2 Browning machine gun to hold off a German counterattack of six tanks plus infantry while calling in artillery. He held for an hour and killed about 50 German soldiers from behind the burning M10 wreck, forcing the tank units to retreat due to loss of infantry support. Audie Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.<ref name=\"USOMurphy\">Walker 2015</ref><ref name=\"MoHMurphy\">Smithsonian Institution. \"The Price of Freedom: Audie Murphy's Medal of Honor Citation.\"</ref>\n\nThe M10s were a part of the American Lend-Lease program to the Allies and as such many M10s found their ways into British, Free French, and Soviet hands. In all, 1,855 M10s were sent in the Lend-Lease program, of which 1,648 were to Great Britain. The British designated the M10s as the 3\" SPM (Self-Propelled Mount) M10. The most famous of the British usage of the M10 was the conversion of the armament into the 17-pounder gun. These converted M10s were designated ''M10C'' or ''M10 17-pdr'' under British nomenclature, though they did issue a name ''[[Achilles|Achilles]]'' to designate all forms of M10 under British service.<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\" />\n\nAfter the end of World War II, most M10s were scrapped or given away as part of the Military Assistance Program to other allies.<ref name=\"ZalogaM10\" />\n\n=== In-game description ===\nA self-propelled artillery/anti-tank mount based on the Sherman tank. A new open turret featuring a more powerful gun, but only manual targeting, was installed on it. It was released from September 1942 to January 1944 and proved to be quite effective in combat against German medium tanks. However, it was not powerful enough to stand up to the Tiger or Panther. And also... Due to its open turret it was vulnerable to artillery barrages and in battles in populated areas.
