At common combat ranges it will be vulnerable to the vast majority of typical rounds, however it is frontally immune from heavy machine gun fire. The crew is made up of 3 total members: the driver, the gunner and the commander, the latter of which is positioned in the MG turret. An incoming shot into this turret will rarely one-shot the tank, but a shot into the drivers port will commonly see the vehicle knocked out. However it is fairly likely enemies will attempt to fire into the MG turret, which will likely only knock out the commander leaving all other assets of the tank completely functional, allowing you to drive off or return fire.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

It won't outpace many enemy vehicles to advantageous positions into the map, and overall doesn't offer any advantage to the vehicle other than being adequately mobile. Its reactive mobility is fairly effective however, it can easily turn in place to face a different direction when upgraded which is necessary due to the hull mounted cannon. It can cruise off-road at 37 km/h in AB and 33 km/h in RB, so it isn't slow by any means, but not notably very fast either. The reverse is only -4/-5 km/h as well, making it hard to back out of an unwanted engagement.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Overall, the performance of the cannon and this round is largely unimpressive, at common combat ranges it can punch through between 35-25 mm of flat armour, which means that it can potentially meet some vehicles that the round can't frontally penetrate without a very well aimed shot. It will struggle against the American Stuarts and the majority of French vehicles, meaning that this vehicles combat ability isn't hugely consistent. Additionally, it lacks the penetration performance to engage at ranges, as past 800 metres or so, the penetration power falls off to only 20 mm of flat penetration which means it will struggle to penetrate the vast majority of enemy vehicles, on top of this the cannon itself is fairly inaccurate. The round does contain 23 grams of explosive filler however, which is enough to one-shot enemy vehicles with 3 crew members or less fairly regularly, which is something to consider.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Granata Perforante da 37 mm || APHE || 39 || 36 || 26 || 17 || 12 || 8\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Granata Perforante da 37 mm || APHE || 640 || 0.7 || 1.2 || 9 || 23 || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_M11-39.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 1.101.0.53''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

They have basically no viability against enemy armour and can only be use to knock out exposed crew members. However, they can potentially be used as an anti-air weapon as the twin machine guns will be enough to cripple enemy aircraft. In practice applying them in this way isn't very viable though, as they can't elevate high enough to be able to attack aircraft unless the aircraft is flying very low, or the tank is positioned on an angle giving it an artificially higher elevation. The machine guns can be used to attack aircraft, however it isn't regularly effective enough to consider this a key strategy.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

One effective way to play is in ambush, lying in wait to engage enemies at close range, at distances the cannon is just too inaccurate and lacks the penetration required to be constantly effective, so playing it at close range negates those issues. It's also important to avoid situations where you could possibly meet an enemy on the move, as adjusting your angle to face the enemy tied with how unstable the cannon is when coming to a stop, means that enemy tanks will likely be able to get a shot off on you before you can accurately fire at them.\n\nIdeally, you're going to want to engage at close range from a sedentary position, watching corners or covering cap points is where you'll likely see the most hostile tanks, so if you can find a good position in these locations you will likely pick up a few kills. Due to the small size of the M11, it might tank enemies a few seconds longer than normal to identify you as a threat, especially if you're positioned out of the way, making this vehicle even more adequately suited to the ambush role.\n\nIt's also important to note which tanks you'll struggle engaging, the M11 lacks the penetration to engage most French tanks and the late American Stuarts and HMCs, so it's a good idea to look at the armour layout of these vehicles to identify weak spots, if an enemy comes into sight that you can't easily penetrate, refrain from engaging it unless it presents a side shot, there's no use firing if you can't reliably cut through the armour. The M11/39 is a more defensive tank when compared to its contemporaries, and if you can identify a good camping position on any given map, the M11 will likely perform well enough.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Influenced by the British Vickers 6-ton, which can be seen in its suspension design; the positioning of the medium-velocity 37mm main armament in a limited-traverse hull mounting rather than a turret was short-sighted and quickly lost favour. The tank had no radio. Only 100 were built before Italy moved on to the M13/40. Twenty-four served, in 4-tank platoons, with the Medium Special Tank Company (Compagnia Speciale Carri M) in the East African Armored Task Force in Italian East Africa until the Italians there were defeated in June 1941. Another 70 were deployed with the 1st and 2nd Medium Tank Battalions, which deployed to Libya in summer, 1940, and were all either destroyed or captured by British forces by early February 1941.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_m11_39 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:M11-39 5.jpg|M11/39 in desert livery\nFile:M11-39 6.jpg|M11/39 In Winter camouflage\nFile:M11-39 2.jpg|M11/39 Engaging an enemy T-26\nFile:M11-39 3.jpg|The M11/39 in standard livery\nFile:M11-39 4.jpg|M11/39 engaging an enemy M8 HMC\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|OJpicKQPBs8|'''Carro Armato {{PAGENAME}}, Italian, Tier-1, Medium Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|CJEU7s9EZiY|'''{{PAGENAME}} Review, Bad gun, Great top turret!''' - ''Joseph 2000''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with a similar chassis\n* [[T-26 (Family)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[SAu 40]] - French tank destroyer with similar configuration of hull cannon and turret machine gun\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:M11/39_tank|[Wikipedia] M11/39 tank]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/italy/Carro_Armato_Medio_M11-39.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Carro Armato M.11/39]\n* [https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=561 <nowiki>[Military Factory]</nowiki> Carro Armato M11/39]\n\n{{TankManufacturer FIAT-Ansaldo}}\n{{Italy light tanks}}"}}
