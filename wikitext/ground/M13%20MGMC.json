In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft (SPAA) vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was one of the first American tanks to be released with the American ground tree in [[Update 1.45 \"Steel Generals\"]].\n\nThe M13 MGMC is an M3 half-track with a dual-mounted .50 calibre M2 Browning machine guns on the rear. The .50 calibre machine guns are mounted in a Maxson M33 Twin Mount. Each machine gun has 200 rounds each, giving it a total of 400 rounds before reloads. Due to this armament, the M13 is foremost an SPAA that relies on its mobility and fire rate to destroy aircraft, or very thinly-armoured tanks. However, when compared to other tanks of its rank, the M13 is a relatively weak vehicle. The MG-only armament gives the M13 exceptional AAA potential, but not much else.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Therefore, rely on the exceptional maneuverability, handling, and speed to either stay in cover or flank weaker tanks. Always relocate when faced with an artillery barrage as the shells will tear the thinly-armoured vehicle apart.\n\nAgainst planes, basic aiming rules apply. Fighters may target you due to the sole designation of SPAA. Hence, always remain on the lookout for enemy aircraft. Strafing aircraft can be extremely deadly; stay in cover and lead your target. The M2s have exceptional AAA ability, take use of their tendency to set opponents alight.\n\nAgainst tanks, flanking and hit and run are a must. The high rate of fire, good handling/mobility, and turret traverse make the M13 a wonderful hit-and-run tank. Aim for crew hatches and weak points in armour. Many times the high fire rate and penetration can easily knock out a crew of sublime armour. However, against better-armoured tanks such as the T-26 or M3 Lee, always stay out of the line of fire and try to avoid tanks such as these altogether.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

As such, the US Army submitted a request for the development of a mobile anti-aircraft vehicle to defend themselves against enemy aircraft. Development didn't start until October 1940 to build such a vehicle, with the purpose to protect mechanized troops from airstrikes. The first build up was a 4x4 truck with an anti-aircraft armament of two .50 cal M2 Browning machine guns, this was called the ''T1''. The development went on with ''T1E1'' with a Bendix mount on an M2 half-track car and the ''T1E2'' with the Maxson mount. ''T1E3'' had an electro-dynamic aircraft turret made for bombers from the Glenn L. Martin Company. Of these three, the ''T1E2'' was selected for further development. The turret design on the ''T1E2'' was placed onto the longer M3 half-track for more ammunition storage. This design, known as the ''T1E4'', was accepted into service as the '''M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage''' on July 27, 1942. A total of 1,103 units were produced from that day until May 15, 1943, though about 583 units were converted to the [[M16 MGMC|M16 MGMC]] before being delivered. First deliveries came in late 1943.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe M13 saw service during the Italian Campaign in the landing at Anzio in January 1944. It served as an anti-aircraft weapon for the initial landings and then later as a ground support role by firing at ground troops and vehicles. The M13 GMC only saw service here, as they were replaced three months later by the newer and better M16 MGMC vehicle, which had four .50 cal machine guns rather than two. Only 139 units of the M13 GMC were deployed overseas by the army.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nWork on a mobile anti-aircraft emplacement began in October 1940, as the US Army needed vehicles capable of covering mechanized columns against enemy air units. In 1941 the Diamond T(WMC) M2 half-track, mass produced by the White Motor Company, was selected as the base for the new model. During trials with a number of different weapon types the decision was made to use the double-barreled W.L. Maxson Corporation M33 machine gun turret equipped with two 12.7 mm Browning M2HB machine guns as the main armament. The Maxson turret offered 360° rotation to go along with 90°+ to -11.5° elevation, and was capable of power rotation at 74° per second.\n\nFollowing trials, the recommendation was made to accept the weapon and launch full-scale production based on the M3 half-track personnel carrier. That decision was based on the fact that the M3 was 250 mm longer, making it an easier fit for the armament and crew.\n\nThe first mass-produced vehicles were launched by the White Motor Company in December 1942 as the M13 MGMC (Multiple Gun Motor Carriage). Production of that modification continued through May 1943, with 1,103 units eventually built.\n\nThe M13 MGMCs joined the US army's AA battalions. By the time the allies landed in France, 568 of them had been refitted with the later M45 turrets. Some M13 MGMCs fought in Sicily, though none were delivered to other countries.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_halftrack_m13 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|7cPgnOXcpdk|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[M16 MGMC]]\n* [[Sd.Kfz.251/21]]\n* [[BTR-152A]]\n* [[Staghound AA]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/703/|[Devblog] Steel Generals: M13 MGMC]]\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/713/|[Devblog] Developers about M13 MGC]]\n* [[wikipedia:M13_Multiple_Gun_Motor_Carriage|[Wikipedia] M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/US/M3_Halftrack.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Half Track Car M3]\n\n{{TankManufacturer White Motor Company}}\n{{USA anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n[[Category:Half-tracks]]"}}
