In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened as '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]] as a battle reward in the [[wt:en/news/5967-news-festivities-in-war-thunder-en|2018 War Thunder Festivities]]. It has since been available for purchase with Golden Eagles.\n\nThe M13/40 (II) is nearly identical to its other in-game variants. Compared to the [[M13/40 (I)]], it has 5 degrees worse gun depression, but its reload rate now matches other rank I tanks, being 3.5 seconds after experting the crew. Compared to the [[M13/40 (III)]], it just has worse gun depression with everything else being same.\n\nVisually, it can be distinguished from the [[M13/40 (I)|mark I]] by its default African camouflage and folded antenna on the right side (left if head-on), and by the lack of chassis parts on top of its left track (right if head-on). It can be distinguished from the [[M13/40 (III)|mark III]] only by lack of the block on top of the middle of the turret.\n\nAn average gun for its BR, it can penetrate the front of some of the tanks it will face and knock them out with a single shot. It has decent armour, strong enough to bounce shots at high angle. The worst aspect of the M13/40 (II), as with the rest of them, is its speed. Poor acceleration makes it hard to achieve its top speed of 32 km/h, and with worse vertical angles it's even less worth it to go up hills.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nAll of your armour, which can realistically be targeted, is flat, so despite quite high frontal armour values the {{PAGENAME}} must always be angled when squaring off with an enemy combatant or risk direct shot penetration of your vehicle. Your side armour value is not as good as the front, but at extreme angles, it becomes more effective.\n\nAs long as you angle your tank right, you will have 36 to 50 mm of effective armour thickness and use it to block enemy shots. Destroy British tanks and any SPG as soon as possible, as every single one of them can destroy your tank. It is also worth destroying Soviet and certain USA tanks first as well, however, not every one of them can penetrate your armour.\n\nThe rear end is also rather long, so enemies could pick this piece off if it is exposed. But it's better to be shot at your engines, than your crew compartment, located in the middle of the tank. Don't give your opponent any time to do that and make them go away before they started firing onto your second tier.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Interior Mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Instead, focus on pushing enemy tanks, as your ammunition is good enough to destroy most tanks in one shot.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The M13 was slow, unreliable, and suffered from the tank commander doubling as the gunner. Similar to early Russian and French tanks, it did not receive radios as standard equipment until 1942. Nevertheless, it became the standard Italian medium tank from 1941 on, and is the best known Italian tank of the war. In War Thunder, the M13/40 (II) represents those made in the mid part of the production run, with hydraulic traverse gears and fixed radio installations.\n\nIt first saw service with the 3rd Medium Tank Battalion (Battaglione Carri M) in Libya's Sollum-Halfaya region. It later equipped 132nd \"Ariete (Ram)\" Armoured Division (Divisione Corazzata) in North Africa. From January to April of 1941, it also saw action in Yugoslavia and Greece with the 131st Centauro (Centaur) and 133rd Littorio armoured divisions. For a short time after the first rush of British victories in North Africa in early 1941, there were enough captured M13s to equip a British armoured unit, 6th Royal Tank Regiment, in Libya. These were all lost in turn to Rommel's offensive in March of that year. In late August of 1941, Italian medium tank platoons increased their number from four to five.\n\nWhen Italy surrendered in September 1943, 22 M13s were captured by Germany, who handed them over to the Italian fascist forces. It is uncertain how many in total were produced, as many were converted to M14/41s: estimates range from 710 to 1,049.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_m13_40_serie_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|fl_W7XOHe9Y|'''{{PAGENAME}} Review.
