In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened as '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]].\n\nM13-40 (III) is a superior version of M13-40, which has reload speed and default camouflage of [[M13/40 (II)|model (II)]], while retaining gun depression of [[M13/40 (I)|model (I)]]. You can distinguish it visually from other 2 by spotting small \"bump\" on its turret's top (above the gun), which was made so that the gun can depress with the new loading mechanism.\n\nThe M13/40 (III), as with the rest of the family, is typically used as a breakthrough tank or a \"blockade runner\" due to the fact that it is very resistant to enemy fire, especially when angled, and can disable or destroy enemy vehicles with only one shot when up close. Beware, however, around the 500 m mark the cannon ammunition starts to lose its punch and can fail to penetrate effectively, and it's not any faster than other tanks of the family.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nMost of the hull armour is flat, so despite quite high frontal armour values the {{PAGENAME}} must always be angled when engaging an enemy combatant or risk easy penetration of the vehicle. The side armour value is not as good as the front, but at extreme angles, it becomes more effective. The turret, however, is not as reliably weak. The strange angles of the mantlet and small size makes the turret quite strong against Rank I vehicles and even if a shot does penetrate, the mantlet will likely absorb enough of the shrapnel to keep your turret crew relatively unharmed.\n\nAs long as you angle your tank right, you will have 36 to 50 mm of effective armour thickness and use it to block enemy shots. If a hull-down position is available, that will be your best option to increase survivability. Destroy British tanks and any SPG as soon as possible, as every single one of them can destroy your tank. It is also worth prioritizing Soviet and certain USA tanks as well, however not every one of them can penetrate your armour reliably.\n\nThe rear end is also rather long, so enemies could pick this piece off if it is exposed. But it's better to be shot at your engines, than your crew compartment, located in the middle of the tank. Don't give your opponent any time to do that and make them go away before they started firing onto your second tier.\n\nThis tank has the desert camouflage as the default one, which means you will be at a disadvantage on non-desert maps at first in terms of stealth.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Interior mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Armour!!Front (Slope angle)!!Sides!!Rear!!Roof\n|-\n|Hull || 30 mm (12°) ''Upper Plate'' <br> 25 mm (80°) - 30 mm (66°) ''Upper Glacis'' <br> 30 mm (Curved) ''Lower Glacis'' || 30 mm ''Upper Front'' <br> 25 mm ''Upper'' <br> 25 mm ''Lower'' || 25 mm ''Upper 3 Levels'' <br> 27 mm ''Lower Level'' ||15 mm ''Crew Compartment'' <br> 5 mm - 15 mm ''Engine Compartment''\n|-\n|Turret || 45 mm (13°) ''Turret front'' <br> 30 mm + 40 mm (Curved) ''Gun mantlet'' || colspan=\"2\" | 25 mm || 15 mm\n|}\n'''Notes:'''\n\n* Turret Ring Guard - 50 mm\n* Fenders, Storage Boxes - 4 mm\n* Tracks - 20 mm\n* Suspension - 10 mm to 15 mm\n* Main Gun - 15 mm\n* Machine Guns - 5 mm\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

Post-penetration effect is enough to destroy most opponents of rank 1 with one or two shots.\n\nUpgraded ammo does not have increased performance against flat armour, however against angled armour it does increase your chances to penetrate turrets along with angled armour and damage something like French tanks at longer range.\n\nOverall, almost nothing can deflect your shots at 100-200 m range.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[47/32 mod.35 (47 mm)|47 mm 47/32 mod.35]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The coaxial-mounted machine gun is hard to use for anything, as it's limited by the traverse of the main gun.

Destroy anyone who dares to fire at you, specifically targeting SPGs and those who forgot to angle their armour. Upgrade your ammunition for a better damage profile.\n\nAlternatively, take a slightly flanking direction near to your team and use your strong characteristics to intercept any fast-moving vehicles while moving along with your team. After finishing the cleanup, flank main battle and destroy defenceless opponents.\n\nIt's not worth fighting heavily armoured vehicles alone while being angled without upgraded ammo. At a range of 500 m, you will probably only penetrate each other's turret and it's more up to luck than anything. One possibility if fighting from this range, your shell can potentially incapacitate turret crew, disabling the tank and allowing a team member with heavier firepower to finish the target off without the threat of being fired upon.\n\nTanks equipped with autocannons can destroy you from the rear and sides, however, they often go for engines first. Keep an eye out for them.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The M13 was slow, unreliable, and suffered from the tank commander doubling as the gunner. Similar to early Russian and French tanks, it did not receive radios as standard equipment until 1942. Nevertheless, it became the standard Italian medium tank from 1941 on, and is the best known Italian tank of the war. In War Thunder, the M13/40 (III) represents those made earlier in the production run, with hydraulic traverse gear and radios in place. They have less maximum ammunition than the (I) model as a result.\n\nThe tank first saw service with the 3rd Medium Tank Battalion (Battaglione Carri M) in Libya's Sollum-Halfaya region. It later equipped 132nd \"Ariete (Ram)\" Armoured Division (Divisione Corazzata) in North Africa. From January to April of 1941, it also saw action in Yugoslavia and Greece with the 131st Centauro (Centaur) and 133rd Littorio armoured divisions. For a short time after the first rush of British victories in North Africa in early 1941, there were enough captured M13s to equip a British armoured unit, 6th Royal Tank Regiment, in Libya. These were all lost in turn to Rommel's offensive in March of that year. In late August of 1941, Italian medium tank platoons increased their number from four to five.\n\nWhen Italy surrendered in September 1943, 22 M13s were captured by Germany, who handed them over to the Italian fascist forces. It is uncertain how many in total were produced, as many were converted to M14/41s: estimates range from 710 to 1,049.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_m13_40_serie_3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|DBZHR4Hcaa0|'''{{PAGENAME}}, Italian, Tier-1 / Reserve, Medium Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|p9_XD0TgdiA|'''TOP 5 Reserve Tanks'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:49  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related Development\n{{main|M13/40 (Family)}}\n\n* [[M14/41]] - <small>(Successor)</small>\n\n;Tanks of comparable role, configuration and era\n\n* [[Pz.35(t)]]\n* [[T-26]]\n* [[A13 Mk I]]\n* [[Ha-Go]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:M13/40_tank|[Wikipedia] M13/40 tank]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/italy/Carro_Armato_Medio_M13-40.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Carro Armato M13/40]\n* [https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=378 <nowiki>[Military Factory]</nowiki> Carro Armato M13/40]\n\n{{TankManufacturer FIAT-Ansaldo}}\n{{Italy medium tanks}}"}}
