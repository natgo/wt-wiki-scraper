In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Regia Marina\"]]. This tank is a one-off modification of the in-tree [[M14/41]] with the 13.2 mm hull-mounted machine-gun which can be useful, but it is purely situational, and an upgraded main gun (the same as mounted on the [[M15/42]]).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members.

The turret can block some shells with its 45 mm front, and the mantlet can ricochet some rounds, but due to the rank increase, it will be more and more challenging to rely on your armour alone. The upper glacis can be penetrated, but some sharp angles can occasionally save you. The driver's vision-port is 50 mm thick. The most obvious weak spot is the side armour, which is only 25 mm unsloped. Spacing between the crew members will save you, but if shots penetrate, it won't be easy to recover. The driver and machine gunner sit behind the transmission, which can increase their chances of survival.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=248|rbMinHp=142}}\n\nThe mobility of this tank (and also the [[M14/41]]) is not great, but not terrible, either. The player won't be the first one at the capture point, but won't be the last either. There is no neutral steering, so the tank will take a moment to turn around.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

As with all low to mid-tier Italian guns, this 47 mm features a good selection of shells. The APBC offers excellent penetration and after effect capabilities, which will always reward the player who can find weak spots on the enemy tanks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[47/40 mod.38 (47 mm)|47 mm 47/40 mod.38]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Since it is hull-mounted, its traverse and firing angles are limited and it can attack only foes coming at you frontally. The clip capacity of the Breda Mod.31 is poor, as it relies on a magazine of 30 bullets instead of a belt like similar machine guns from other nations. It will also become unusable the moment the tank loses the machine gunner/radio operator.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Breda Mod. 38 (8 mm)|8 mm Breda Mod. 38]]\n|-\n!

It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.\nThe pintle-mounted machine gun cannot traverse independently of the turret horizontally and is limited by the rather slow rotation speed of the turret. Furthermore, its limited elevation and traverse does not allow to target low-flying aircraft. The clip capacity of the machine gun is poor, as it relies on a magazine of 24 bullets instead of a belt like similar machine guns from other nations.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Combat tactics\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is basically a M14/41 tank boasting a better gun and thus sitting at a higher battle rating. With the BR increase, the competition gets also tougher. That's why the {{PAGENAME}} features henceforth average armour for its rank, especially the sides and around the turret. Frontally, the massive 30 mm front plate is the biggest weak spot: flat, hard to miss and a penetrating shot through this plate will kill the driver and the gunner that sits behind him. To avoid this, you can angle your tank about 30 degrees to the left to hide your flat plate and present instead the MG bulge that could absorb some shots. This however is not a durable strategy, any expert tanker won't fall for that trick.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}}'s top speed of 38 km/h limits its opportunities as a flanker. Its flat armour also limits its capacity to advance exposed in the open and its rather slow turret rotation prevents it from reacting quickly to 360° threats as a frontline tank. Its solid 47 mm gun on the other hand coupled with 10 degrees of gun depression makes the {{PAGENAME}} a good support tank. Stay behind cover at a distance (500 to 700 m) from the frontline to support spearheading tanks, this will also increase your armour advantage. On top of that, the {{PAGENAME}} sports with a crew of 4 (and 1 spare) a longer durability than most tanks at its BR. When being focused on the action, it is imperative to always check for 2 main threats: flanking enemies who could reach you quickly from the frontline and tank destroyers with a high penetration power lurking at a safe distance. If you're flanked, your turret doesn't turn all too fast: rotate your hull instead. Pivot turning in the {{PAGENAME}} will always be faster than turning your turret. If you spot a tank destroyer aligned on your position, retreat or get behind cover.\n\n;Notable enemies\n\n* Heavy tanks like B1 bis or B1 ter whose armour is too strong for your gun,\n* Tank destroyers with powerful guns like the Marder III, ZiS-30, Ho-Ni I, Ho-Ni III, Chi-Ha LG or the LVT(A)(4) (ZiS-2) (China),\n* Tanks with HEAT shells like the Pz. IV E, F1, the StuG III A or the StuH 42 G,\n* Tanks with APDS shells like the Strv m/40L, the Strv m/41 S-II or the Lago I,\n* Tanks with many crew members like the M3 Lee, the Grant I, the T-28 or the T-28E whose durability is high.\n\n;How to defeat a {{PAGENAME}}\nRule of thumb is to get as close as possible as you can to maximise your penetration power as its armour is flat.\n* In a frontal encounter, shoot right in the middle of the front plate if the {{PAGENAME}} did not angle its hull. This will knock out the gunner and the driver.\n* If it is hull down, aim at the turret cheeks.\n* If its hull is angled, aim at the flat corners of the hull.\n* If you manage to flank the {{PAGENAME}}, aim for the hull spot right under the center of the turret or the turret itself.\n* From the rear, target the turret first and then the crew compartment right under the turret (avoid shooting in the engine compartment: it will absorb shots with little damage to the crew).\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The only variant of the M14/41 was a command vehicle, which had its turret removed and only had a Breda mod.38 machine gun mounted as the anti-air weapon on the turret ring, while the 13.2 mm Breda machine gun was hull-mounted. These command vehicles were then added to the SPG platoons.
