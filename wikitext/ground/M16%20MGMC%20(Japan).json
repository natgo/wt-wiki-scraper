Posing a large threat to most planes within roughly 1.5 km range, the 4 x .50 cals can shred both plane and pilot after a good burst of direct hits on the plane.\n\nWhile the M16 and its .50 cals doesn't offer the same explosiveness over Japan's earlier arsenal possessing the [[Type 98 (20 mm)]], it does make up for it in sustained fire due to the multiple barrels and larger belts making sure that once engaged with an enemy plane, there are very few moments where the plane can fly easily as long as you keep sights and trigger on it. You can switch target once the plane flies out of range, gets set on fire, or the pilot is knocked out.\n\nAlso unlike the previous Army's arsenal of anti-air, the M16 only offers a maximum penetration of 31 mm and purely is meant to shoot down planes with Incendiary rounds. Though some daring tankers might be able to knock out a light tank or two from the side, with the mediocre mobility of a half-track and lacklustre HMGs, it is ill-advised to use this dedicated anti-air in the anti-tank role.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Similar in function to the national police, they were trained by American officers and equipped with American military equipment including most firearms and uniforms. Limited under treaty from building their own military designs, Japan sought assistance from the US to provide its heavy equipment. In particular, Japanese personnel were supplied with 168 M16 half-tracks for logistical needs but also close infantry support. M45 turrets with quad .50 cal mountings were supplied from surplus American stocks and fitted to the vehicles. Under the 1st District Force (NSF), the first anti-air units were comprised using the \"hand-me-down\" M16s. These vehicles would pass into the JGSDF in 1954 and while they would see use until 1974, almost 20 years after America had discontinued their M16s, they eventually were deemed obsolete for their primary purpose.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer White Motor Company}}\n{{Japan anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n[[Category:Half-tracks]]"}}
