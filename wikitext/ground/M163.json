Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nArmour is not on the operator's side in the M163, as it is thin enough to be destroyed by 12.7 mm machine guns from the sides and rear, and any cannon-sized armament from the front. The turret is partially open, leaving the crew vulnerable to enemy light arms fire. If attacked, the best bet for taking a hit and surviving is to point the engine towards the enemy and hope it absorbs the shot.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Aluminum alloy 5083 (hull)\n* Structural steel (front and rear fenders)\n* Rubber-fabric screens (fenders/sideskirts)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The M168 is a variant of the [[M61 (20 mm)|M61]] cannon, which can be found in-game on vehicles such as the Japanese [[T-2]], and the American [[F-4C Phantom II]]. Used initially during the Vietnam war, the M168 was a 20 mm air-cooled rotary cannon attached to a small turret on the M163. Dangerous to anything in the sky, it will lock on and rip through anything in its path.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[M168 (20 mm)|20 mm M168]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

In an anti-aircraft role, it is best used as a point-defence SPAA, defending a group of allies/cap zone from air attack. Its range isn't as good as the [[M247]], so it's best to keep in mind the approximate 1 km targeting zone of the M163.\n\nThe M163 wields about 60 mm of penetration, which is enough to mortally wound/destroy many lightly-armoured vehicles such as the [[Leopard I|Leopard]], [[AUBL/74|AUBL]], and [[Centauro]].\n\nThe high rate of fire also allows the M163 a sort of CIWS (Close-In Weapon System) type of role, as it can easily spray in the direction of an incoming bomb, thus destroying it and saving nearby allies. This is especially easy against the infamous FAB-5000 bomb from the Soviet [[Pe-8]], as the bomb is large and easy to track.\n\n[[File:CIWS M163.jpg|thumb|An M163 firing at a FAB-5000, right before the bomb is hit and destroyed.]]\n\n===Radars===\n{{main|AN/VPS-2}}\nThe M163 is equipped with an [[AN/VPS-2]] tracking radar, with no search radar. The radar is fitted to the side of the turret.\n{{Notice|In order to lock on you must be looking through your sight, position the crosshair over a target (within 7 km) and press the lock on key.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nThe M163 VADS (Vulcan Air Defense System) was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) based on the chassis of the M113 armoured personnel carrier (APC). It was nearly unmodified from the base M113, and featured the same armour scheme, rear loading ramp, and the General Motors 6V53 series 6-cylinder 2-cycle diesel engine (212 hp). An open-topped turret was fitted to the center of the roof of the vehicle, and an M61 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon was mounted in the turret. The gun could fire at 3,000 rpm or 1,000 rpm, and the elevation was from -5° to +80°.  The M163 was operated by a crew of four, and there was a wide variety of ammunition for the main gun. A tracking radar was fitted to the turret to improve the chances of destroying an enemy aircraft, but the anti-aircraft ability of the M163 was limited and it was only useful against low-flying aircraft within 5 km, and the chances of destroying the aircraft were best within 1 km.\n\nThe M163 entered service with the United States Army in 1969, but at least six vehicles were sent to the Vietnam War before the type had entered service. The vehicles sent to South Vietnam were not fitted with the tracking radar, and they were used mostly in an infantry support role. The M163 was later upgraded to the M163A1 and A2 standards. The M163A1 had an improved gun mount, and the M163A2 featured the improved M113A2 powerplant. The M163 PIVADS (Product Improved Vulcan Air Defense System) upgrade was introduced in 1984. The PIVADS upgrade featured improved radar and accuracy of the gun, and it also introduced armour-piercing capabilities with an APDS round. Over time, the M163 began to be used more in an infantry support role, as surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems became more common. It notably served during the First Gulf War. The M163 was retired from US Army service in 1993.\n\nThe M163 was also used by a number of other nations. These include Albania, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Portugal, South Korea, Thailand, and Tunisia. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) upgraded a number of M163 vehicles with a launcher for 4 x FIM-92 Stinger SAMs, and these were called the Machbet. The IDF also upgraded their vehicles with improved electronics. The M163 is still in service with a number of the nations listed above.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_m163_vulcan Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|NSzDEfmszVM|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|vtCKzvbLfNg|'''The Shooting Range #18''' - Metal Beasts section at 00:45 discusses the M163.|SJoW-2_6J6o|'''Amphibious tanks'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:43  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''<br><small>Note: M163 no longer amphibious as of [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]]</small>}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:M163_VADS|[Wikipedia] M163 VADS]]\n* [https://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/EE03%20-%20M163%20Vulcan.html [Weapon Systems<nowiki>]</nowiki> M163 Vulcan]\n\n=== References ===\n\n;Bibliography\n\n* M163 VADS.
