It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]]. This Japanese vehicle is identical to the American [[M24]] Chaffee.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe M24 Chaffee has thin armour on all sides, and can only effectively resist machine gun fire or very low-penetrating guns like 20 mm autocannon. Its crews are also very close to each other, increasing the chance of it getting one-shotted. The V-shaped gun mantlet might bounce some small calibre shells if you are lucky enough. However, don't rely on it as the rest of the tank is still poorly protected. Common guns like the 75 mm M1 or 76 mm F-34 / ZiS-5 can easily destroy the M24 with one shot.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It also responds fast when reversing. Thanks to its short and wide tracks it is able to turn quickly. However the acceleration is poor, making it to feel sluggish when performing short manoeuvres.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The M61 shot, which is an APCBC, is generally better than the M72 AP. It has 63.7g explosives which brings a deadly blast once penetrated, has better penetration (104 mm max) and it has a slightly lower chance of ricocheting. With the M61 shot, the Chaffee is able to one-shot plenty of tanks at its BR like the M4, T-34, Crusader or even the KV-1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[M6 (75 mm)|75 mm M6]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The roof-mounted .50 cal can traverse 360 degrees and has great depression & elevation, posting a big threat to any plane that is flying too close to the M24. It has an unbelievable penetration of 31 mm at 10 m, meaning it can easily penetrate plenty of lightly armoured vehicles and even the side of some low rank medium tanks (eg. Sd.Kfz.234 series, side of Pz.III/IV). The 7.62 mm, on the other hand, can only efficiently damage exposed crews due to its low penetration.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[M2HB (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm M2HB]]\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe M24 (Japan) is a very good tank with a fairly interesting play style. Instead of being permanently stationed at a single point and continuously firing at an enemy, this tank offers impressive manoeuvrability and speed which allows it to perform impressive flanking manoeuvres. The M24 can travel at around 38 km/h forward and -25 km/h backwards. Its reverse speed is very good if a quick getaway by going backwards is needed. Thus, this tank excels at \"peek-a-boo\" tactics in which one hides behind a rock or other large piece of cover and repeatedly inches out to fire at an enemy.\n\nThe tank offers a 75 mm M6 gun, which has a slower reload than the [[M4|Sherman]]'s 75 mm M3 gun but is otherwise the same. Its shells come in handy for certain tanks; they generally penetrate armour very well. It is rare to experience a ricochet or be to unable to penetrate any armour.\n\nDo not continuously shoot at a tank without backing up/moving. The vehicle's armour is very thin and will most likely be destroyed if it stays in one position and does not stop changing positions. Always try to get the first shot off in a head-on attack. Typically, the best shell to use is the M61 shell but it can also be beneficial to have M72 shells as well.\n\nAnother way to go around is to flank the enemy. If attacking with a more direct approach, keep hidden behind a building or boulder and pop out every now and then to take a shot at the enemy. Also, prioritize targets who are busy fighting others and cannot retaliate. Usually, after the first shot, it may disable their tank depending on what it is. Disabling the enemy tank's crew, tracks, engine, etc. allows for retaliation without the risk of any incoming enemy shells.\n\n'''<big>Enemies worth noting</big>''':\n\n* [[Sd.Kfz.234 (Family)|Sd.Kfz.234]] series (mixed ground battles) - The M24, although agile, is still not the fastest tank at its rank. When your opposite team has Germany, you might want to reconsider the option of capping a point straight away, since the German Sd.Kfz.234 series are very likely to be there first. The [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]] (also known as the Puma) is a turreted 8-wheel vehicle with a small profile, extremely high on-road speed and a powerful 50 mm gun. But it cannot turn in place, has a very slow turret traverse and only 8 mm of side hull armour, so a good tactic is to circle with it and utilise your stabiliser, fast turret and the piercing .50 cal. In an intense tank \"dogfight\", you might miss your shots. Don't worry, your reliable .50 cal got you! It can penetrate the sides, or even the front of the puma easily. The [[Sd.Kfz.234/3]] and [[Sd.Kfz.234/4]], although being equally deadly, are turretless. You can use some quick turns to avoid their guns or tear through the thin armour plate protecting their gunners with your .50 cal.\n* [[KV-1]], [[KV-1E]], [[KW I C 756 (r) (Germany)|KW I C 756 (r)]] - The famous KV series can cause a bit of troubles too. They are well know for their well-protected hull and turrets. The M24 can manoeuvre to point-blank range, line up your gun so it's pointing dead flat at the armour and fire. The 104 mm penetration of the M61 shell should punch a hole in the KV's armour with ease. If you are close enough but do not have the space to manoeuvre, shoot their gun barrel to prevent them from getting a shot off, then go for their turret ring or the vertical part on their gun mantlet, which is only 90 mm. For the KV-1E, do not fire at its turret from the front and side, as they are 105 mm thick and will never get penetrated. For the KV I C 756, aim for the cupola (50 m) or the gun mantlet (50 mm) to knock out the turret crew or the gun breech. Don't shoot at anywhere else, the shell won't penetrate.\n* [[Churchill (Family)|Churchill]] heavy tanks - The Churchills, with their complex hulls and sturdy turrets, can be quite hard to kill at range. Again, manoeuvre as close to them as possible, the idea distance being no more than 200 m. If they are angling their hull but facing their turret at you, only go for the turret. For the Mk I Churchills, aim at the near-vertical part of their rounded cheeks to ensure successful penetrations. For the Mk III and the German Churchill, also aim for their flat turret which is at most 89 mm. The shell should go in easily and knock out most, if not all of the crew. Only when you are facing their hull without any angles should you shoot the hull, otherwise shoot the turret only, as their big tracks can easily get in front of the frontal hull. The side hull have multiple layers of armour, some of which are weirdly angled and can absorb plenty of shells.\n* [[M4A2]]/[[M4A4 (1st PTG)|A4]] - These Sherman tanks are widely used by over 3 nations that spread across both the Allied and the Axis side, so no matter which nation you play they can be quite tough to destroy in the hands of a skilled tanker. Given the rather weak penetration of your short 75 mm gun, their hull can be almost impossible to penetrate when angled, hull down or 300 m away. For a M4A4, there are 2 apparent bulges on the upper front plate, a penetration through there is a guaranteed kill most of the times. But in case the opponent covers them up or when it's an M4A2, aim for the middle parts of the gun mantlet or the turret armour unprotected by the mantlet, you can at least make them defenseless.\n* [[StuG III G]], [[StuH 42 G]], [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)]] - These German tank destroyers could either be lethal ambushes or heavily armoured \"heavy tanks\". They have low profiles which make them harder to be recognised especially in vegetative/hilly environments. Additionally they have extremely thick frontal protection for their BRs. Specifically, the StuG and StuH can have a greatest frontal thickness of 100 mm with extra tracks, making them almost invincible for the M24's short 75 mm gun. Therefore M24 ought to stay away from direct battle with them as they are hard to be frontally penetrated and can without much of a stretch destroy the M24. Luckily, all 3 don't have a turret and are inadequately protected in terms of side armour, so flanking become an effective way to finish them off. Nonetheless, know that StuG and StuH can turn their hull quite fast in response to flankers, so be careful when circling them.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

M61 shell can one shot common tanks like the T-34 series, M4A1, Cromwell or even the KV-1.\n* Fast turret traverse allows it to track agile targets easily\n* Low profile allows it to easily hide behind small bushes or rocks, increasing survivability\n* Equipped with a vertical plane stabilizer, allowing for more accurate shots on the move or shoot-n-scoot tactics\n* Pintle mounted HMG allows for air defense and some anti tank ability (eg. GAZ trucks, SU-76, [[ZSD63]])\n* 13 smoke grenades allow escaping from dangerous situation for many times\n* Effective even in uptiers if used for flanking shots or hunting soft targets\n* Very fast reverse allowing it to retreat from danger quickly\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Low survivability: all-round thin armour and closely packed crews. Can get one-shot by common guns like 75 mm M3, 76 mm F-34 and 75 mm Kwk 40\n* Acceleration is rather sluggish, especially on soft terrains\n* On-road top speed is still inferior to some wheeled vehicles like the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]]\n* Shells drop dramatically at long distances, making distant / moving targets hard to shoot at\n* Reload time is pretty slow for a light tank\n* Low ammo count can be a problem in long games or RB/SB matches\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n===Development===\nAs early as 1942, the light tanks [[M3 Stuart|M3]] and [[M5A1|M5 Stuart]] have been seen as severely lacking in the modernizing design of tanks and how they fight. The armour was seen as insufficient and the 37 mm gun was also deemed useless against newer German tanks like the [[Pz.III J|Panzer III]] and [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV]]. The system needed an upgrade, specifically a light tank that mounts the 75 mm gun seen on the [[M4|Shermans]]. An attempt to mount a 75 mm gun on a Stuart was deemed inefficient as it reduced ammo stowage and left the armour too thin on the design.\n\nIn April 1943, Ordnance with Cadillac started on a project for the new light tank, designation Light Tank T24. The powertrain and transmission of the M5 Stuart was used with the ultimate goal of producing a vehicle weighing less than 20 tons. This left the vehicle with relatively thin armour to keep light. At the time, a lighter 75 mm gun was developed for mounting on the [[B-25J-20|B-25 Mitchell bomber]] without sacrificing performance, and this was mounted onto the light tank in development. The tank used 410 mm wide tracks with a torsion bar suspension that greatly improves cross-country travel. The engine was a Cadillac 44T24 V-8 petrol engine. The chassis was designed with the expectation that it would be used as a basis of many different vehicle roles so it was called the \"Light Combat Team\". The light tank end design had a low profile at 9 ft. 1 in. height and featuring a crew of five with a three-man turret, an improvement over the two-man turrets of the Stuarts. The first finished vehicle arrived on October 15, 1943 and was deemed a success, starting a contract for 1,000 units that was later raised to 5,000 units. The vehicle was classified as the Light Tank M24 and as the \"Chaffee\" by the British after US General Adna R. Chaffee, Jr., who helped develop some of America's earliest tank designs. The vehicle was produced by Cadillac and Massey-Harris from April 1944 to August 1945 with a total of 4,731 units produced.\n\n===Japanese service===\n[[File:M24 (NSF).jpg|right|thumb|Parade of \"Special vehicles\", 1953]]\nAfter the defeat of Japan during WWII, American forces occupied Japan and established a new government and abolished any Japanese military force. This would change in the 1950s with the outbreak of the Korean conflict and many of the American forces were moved to South Korea, leaving Japan undefended. This in turn allowed Japan to re-establish a force only to defend itself with, which started out as the NPR (National Police Reserve). Even though by legal status only a police force, it was modeled and trained after the United States Army.\n\nIn 1952, the NPR would grow larger and would be renamed into the NSF (National Safety Force) as the Police Reserve started to look more and more like a small army, this together with their \"{{Annotation|special vehicles|特車}}\" being US tanks such as the M24 Chaffee and M4 Sherman.\n\nOn July 1st, 1954, after the 1954 Self-Defense Forces Act [Act No. 165 of 1954], Japan was officially allowed to have legal military force under the name of the JSDF (Japan Self Defense Forces). Along with equipment transferred over from the NPR/NSF, more equipment was shipped over from America to supply the newly established Self Defense Force to have a built up reserve.\n\nWhile the M24 was already outdated for the Cold War against the Soviet's [[T-34-85]], they would still see limited use in the SDF considering no active war was being fought and Japan still had to develop its own tank arsenal.\n\nOnly until 1974, with the introduction of the [[Type 74 (Family)|Type 74]], would the M24s be completely be phased out as a relic of the past.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_m24_chaffee Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|9CJA4MHCzbg|'''{{PAGENAME}} SDF, Japanese, Tier-3, Light Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|bpzZpJaW62Q|'''{{PAGENAME}} SDF Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[AMX-13 (FL11)]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Cadillac}}\n{{Japan light tanks}}"}}
