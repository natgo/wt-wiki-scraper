The {{PAGENAME}} is about 3 tons heavier than the M48A1 (49.3 tons vs. 46.4 tons), and has a slightly weaker engine, which translates into a slightly more sluggish machine compared to the M48A1. The M48A1 has a max engine power of 810 hp, while the {{PAGENAME}}'s engine power is 750 hp. For a vehicle this heavy, it has fairly good mobility. When spaded, it can comfortably hit a top speed of 45 km/h on flat terrain, while in cross-country you will have a top speed of around 25 km/h. While going backwards, the top speed is somewhat less impressive: about -9 km/h.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Good to start with until comfortable with other types of ammunition.\n\n* '''40 mm AP-T:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - Very powerful ammunition which can be used against ground targets with significantly more penetration than other 35-40 mm AP-T projectiles. Will easily destroy any target with side shots even outside the point-blank range and can destroy lighter targets and weak spots from the front even against main battle tanks.\n\n* '''M811:''' {{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}} - Unlike the M822 HEE-VT shells, these require direct hits on aircraft to do significant damage, but if problems are experienced with M822 detonating too early this belt may be your best choice.\n\n* '''M822:''' {{Annotation|HE-VT*|High-explosive variable time fuze (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HE-VT*|High-explosive variable time fuze (self-destroying)}}{{-}}{{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}} - Proximity-fused shells that absolutely obliterate aircraft when they make contact, though if they detonate too early, they will do little to no damage. Somewhat unreliable in if they detonate within range of the target, but when they do the target will quickly take considerable damage if not destroyed. The only ammunition for self-propelled anti-aircraft guns that which can cause enough shrapnel damage to bring down planes and helicopters even with near misses. This round should be the go-to anti-air ammunition, although the M811 is a good backup if the M822 is problematic for the gunner.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Default HEF-I || HEF-I* || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6 || 6\n|-\n| Default AP-T || AP-T || 94 || 90 || 77 || 62 || 51 || 41\n|-\n| M822 || HE-VT || 5 || 5 || 5 || 5 || 5 || 5\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Default HEF-I || HEF-I* || 1,100 || 0.86 || 0 || 0.1 || 262 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| Default AP-T || AP-T || 1,025 || 0.93 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"12\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Arming distance<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Trigger radius<br>(m)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| M822 || HE-VT* || 1,100 || 0.86 || 0 || 0.1 || 191 || 500 || 4 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated:''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

When using the  M247 you can easily shred some lightly armoured vehicles like the Leopard 1. Where the speciality for the M247 is with its Proximity fused 40 mm rounds. They will shred any aircraft within a 2.0 km radius. You can play the vehicle mostly in 2 ways. You can push and try defending caps from the enemies and keeping the skies clear, or stay back behind cover and keep the skies clear for your allies, while using your AP rounds to fend off enemy vehicles.\n\nGenerally, enemy tanks should be avoided - especially from the front - but in desperate times or the right circumstances many of them can be dealt with. Due to the decent armour-piercing ammunition used by the M247, most tanks at its BR can be penetrated from the side. Common examples of tanks that are easy to penetrate from the side are the Leopard 1 and OF-40 families. Soviet tanks are quite a bit harder to penetrate and may not be penetrated except when nearly perpendicular to your guns. All light tanks and SPAAs can be penetrated from the side and many of them from the front as well. Again, full sized tanks should not generally be engaged except when there is no other choice, in which case aiming for the gun barrel may be the best choice, except when engaged from the side. Light vehicles, on the other hand, can be engaged favorably in most circumstances.\n\n'''Ammunition'''\n\nThe recommended ammunition belt is the M822 belt, which includes both the AP and HE-VT rounds.\n\nThis belt is the best at taking out enemy aircraft because the proximity fuze rounds make it so that a direct hit on an aircraft is not needed, the shells must only pass near the aircraft to damage it. This belt also includes armour-piercing rounds so that if a ground target is spotted it can be engaged when necessary. The AP rounds have enough penetration (94 mm maximum) to go through the fronts of many light tanks and SPAA vehicles, as well as the sides of most other vehicles including main battle tanks (MBTs). The only class of vehicles that can not be penetrated in a majority of cases is the heavy tank class, which should be avoided as much as possible.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It was designed to fight alongside the [[M1 Abrams]] and [[M3 Bradley|M2/M3 Bradley]], in order to provide cover against aircraft. There were other SPAA vehicles in service at the time; these were the [[M163|M163 Vulcan]] and the MIM-72/M48 Chaparral. The former being a 20 mm rotary cannon mounted on an armoured personnel carrier, and the latter being a heavily modified armoured personnel carrier chassis with a surface-to-air missile launcher. Neither of those two vehicles were designed as SPAA's, and so, did not have the necessary performance to be adequate at their job. The M247 was designed as a replacement for both of the previous vehicles.\n\nDesigns from a multitude of companies were entered into the competition. Only two were selected for testing: the Ford XM-247 with twin Bofors 40mm cannons and the General Dynamics XM-246 with twin Oerlikon 35mm cannons. The two prototypes were tested, and the XM-247 was selected as the winner, although the XM-246 had outscored it in all the shooting tests. The M247, as it was soon designated, ran into many problems. The radar was extremely deficient; it had a hard time distinguishing trees from planes, and if the guns were pointed too high, they would get in the radar's way and confuse it even more. In addition, it took too long for the radar to pick up a target and for the guns to actually take aim. In addition, the turret traverse speed was much too slow, the vehicle it's self was too sluggish to keep up the M1's and M2's, and it was unreliable in cold weather. Eventually, the program was cancelled after more testing, where it was proven the system could not even shoot down stationary drones. There was still a need for an anti-aircraft vehicle that could keep up with modern vehicles, so Oerlikon Canada created the [[ADATS]] anti-aircraft missile system. This was not as successful as hoped, and was only accepted into Canadian service. The void was eventually filled by the M6 Linebacker, an M2 Bradley with Stinger missiles instead of TOW missiles. The Linebacker was capable of keeping up with modern armoured forces, which was the reason for its acceptance, even though the Stingers were not as effective as the ADATS missiles<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M247_Sergeant_York</ref>.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_m247 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[M48 Patton (Family)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[AMX-30 DCA]]\n* [[VEAK 40]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5714-development-tam-and-m247-sergeant-york-en|[Devblog] TAM and M247 Sergeant York]]\n* [[wikipedia:M247_Sergeant_York|[Wikipedia] M247 Sergeant York]]\n* [https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=644 <nowiki>[Military Factory]</nowiki> M247 Sergeant York]\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ford}}\n{{USA anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
