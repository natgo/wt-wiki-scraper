Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=406|rbMinHp=232}}\n\nThe overall mobility is decent. The top speed is great, easily getting to around 50 km/h on solid roads which is faster than most of the reserve tanks like the [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]] or the [[T-26]]. However, wheeled vehicles like the [[Sd.Kfz. 140/1]] can easily outrun the M2A4 on road. On softer roads like grassland and sand, it remains around 30 km/h which is still quite fast.\n\nThe hull traverse brings the overall mobility down quite a bit, since when the tank is still it turns very sluggishly, especially on soft terrain. The hull traverse gets faster when the tank is moving, but in full speed, it starts to snake around like a wheeled vehicle which makes it hard to control. Thus you must get used to this handling.\n\nThe reverse speed is only adequate to dodge shots from a distance. Do not expect to quickly reverse back to cover like a [[Sd.Kfz.234 (Family)|Sd.Kfz.234]].\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|M5 (37 mm)}}\n\nThe overall firepower is decent at its BR. The main cannon has an adequate penetration of about 60 mm which is more than enough to go through most tanks below BR 2.0, for example, [[T-26]], [[Panzer III (Family)|Pz.III]] and [[Pz.35(t)]]. Although the available ammunition is all solid shells, they still make quite a bit shrapnel when penetrated which is enough to knock out compact tanks like T-26 and Pz.35(t) with a single shot. For larger tanks like the [[LVT (Family)|LVT(A)]], accurate shots pinpointing the crew are required which might be a little hard for new players. The cannon has enough accuracy to precisely knock out the enemy's crew within 500 m. If one shot misses, the reload time of around 3.5 seconds allows quick following shots.\n\nThere is a nice stabiliser for the cannon which is a big advantage when exchanging fire, as it allows you to move out of cover and fire (usually before the enemy) without having to wait for your tank to stop wobbling. The stabiliser should be utilised to maximise your chance of surviving and taking out enemy tanks. Note that it only works below 10 km/h, so remember to slow down or it will not stabilise the gun.\n\nTargets like the [[15cm sIG 33 B Sfl]] or [[M3 GMC]] (in mixed ground battles) can be quite hard to destroy, as their armour is thin enough to create little shrapnel, but are also thick enough to stop MG bullets. Against them, you can only rely on you fire rate, accuracy and of course your knowledge of their crew position to knock out their crew one by one. Always go for the gunners or drivers first, if you failed then they can always fight back and knock your tank out with a single shot.\n\nThe main cannon is only effective in close quarter combat (usually within 200 m) or against weakly-armoured targets, since the penetration drops drastically as the range increases, plus the small calibre makes the shells easy to ricochet. When encountering fairly well armoured tanks like the [[M13/40 (Family)|M13/40]] or [[H.35]], try and break their gun barrels first or track them. If they are too far away, pin them on the map and call teammates to help.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[M5 (37 mm)|37 mm M5]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The penetration of around 10 mm is not enough to go through the frontal armour of those not-so-weakly-armoured tanks like the [[SU-5-1]], [[Panzerjäger I]] or [[15cm sIG 33 B Sfl]]. If you are skilled, the two MG can effectively damage low-flying biplanes.\n\nThe fixed MG in the hull are useless most of the times, as they have absolutely no traverse. It is very hard to point the hull directly at a target given the poor hull traverse of the M2A4.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[M1919A4 (7.62 mm)|7.62 mm M1919A4]]\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe M2A4 light tank is the reserve tank for the USA. As such, it is very manoeuvrable and fast, being a light tank. However, it has many distinguishing features that make it a forgiving beginners tank.\n\nThe M2A4 is most comparable to a cross between a [[BT-5]] and [[T-26]]. The M2A4 has slightly less mobility than the BT-5 while being a larger target and having better armour, like the T-26. The M2A4 also has a fast-firing 37 mm M5 cannon that can fire M74 or M51 shots, as well as the M61 shell.\n\nIts gun has better accuracy than the majority of tanks on its rank, and its APC ammo retains its penetration at most ranges. This ability to hit rapidly from range and still penetrate in part makes up for the somewhat anaemic damage of the 37 mm gun.\n\nLike all tanks of this rank, it is lightly-armoured and can be damaged or knocked out by any other vehicle from almost anywhere on the map. A useful tactic is to make use of its speed by engaging at range and then relocating when enemy presence gets too heavy around you.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\nSpecific enemy vehicles that bear mentioning are firstly any Germans with the [[KwK38 (20 mm)|20 mm KwK/FlaK38]] cannon, this gun might be small but can have up to 64 mm of penetration, which is enough to go through the M2A4 almost anywhere. These guns can also fire 10 rounds at 280 rounds/min before having to reload the clip, meaning that they will very easily take out your crew before you have a chance to respond. To counter, the best chance you have is to angle your frontal armour which can make it difficult for the PzGr 40 rounds to penetrate. The Soviet [[T-50]] and [[T-126]] are vehicles you will also see commonly, these have fairly thick and angled frontal armour that will prevent you from easily getting through. These tanks can also carry an APHEBC round that will destroy you in one shot with little difficulty, so to counter you should use your speed to attempt to get a side shot into either the turret or engine. If the T-50 cannot move you can outrun its turret and finish it without much difficulty.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

However, multiple theorists brought up the idea of a cavalry role for the tanks to which the British were the first to incorporate with the ''cruiser tanks''. Limitation in American development leads to the establishment of light tanks as the ''combat cars''. The development team soon looked at the tank prototypes ''T1 light tank'' and the ''T2 medium tank'' from which they decided to use them as the basis for the light tank design.\n\nModifications made onto the experimental tanks including installing the new Vertical Volute Spring Suspension (VVSS) which became the main suspension in future American tank development, made the tanks into the '''M2A1 light tank'''. The main version used before the war was designated the [[M2A2]] and had two turrets, both with a .50 calibre M2 Browning machine gun as their armament. However, the Spanish Civil War demonstrated that this kind of light tank was insufficient for the ever-evolving tank warfare. Revising the armament of the tank, the two M2 Browning turrets were removed and replaced with a turret outfitted with a 37 mm cannon and improved armour. This became the '''M2A4''' and served as the main light tank variant in US service prior to World War II.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe M2 series traced its family tree back to the experimental T2s, with the M2A4 ending up the largest and most successful modification. Development began in 1939 after running trials for light tanks designed for infantry support as well as the M1 series. The M2 infantry tank was used as the base for construction, a model that was to undergo significant modification. The turret armour as well as the front end were thickened to 25 mm, capable of withstanding hits by light cannons and high-calibre machine guns. The tank's weaponry was also improved with the installation of an M5 37 mm cannon paired with a 7.62 mm machine gun in the single turret.\n\nAnother 7.62 mm machine gun was mounted in the front hull plate, with two more on the sides. An antiaircraft machine gun could be mounted on the top of the turret, and additional viewing slits were cut out of the turret and cupola. Most tanks featured the 360 hp Continental W-670-9A engine, which pushed their top speed to 56 km/h. Several tanks in the series were equipped with Guiberson T1020 diesel engines.\n\nGiven that September 1939 saw a spike in orders, the Rock Island Arsenal was no longer able to keep up on its own with the demand being placed on it by the US army. A tender for an additional batch was announced and won by American Car & Foundry. In October 1939 a contract for 329 tanks was signed, though it was soon expanded to 365. The last ten were assembled in April 1941 by Baldwin Locomotive Works, meaning that 375 M2A4s were produced in 1940.\n\nThe tanks only saw action on Guadalcanal and other Pacific islands. A few others were shipped to the UK via Lend-Lease and used there to train M3 medium tank crews.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_m2a4_1st_armor_div Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|xSnKPq-oljQ|'''Premium Series (Tanks), {{PAGENAME}}.
