In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''', or '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''', is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nArmour protection of the Bradley CFV (Cavalry Fighting Vehicle) is relatively weak, it does offer protection from machine guns and some lower penetrating autocannon fire from the front, but most autocannons will easily penetrate the sides of the vehicle damaging components, crew and often detonating ammo stored in the rear of the vehicle. As aside, the engine mounted in front of the vehicle will offer some protection from main guns on tanks by absorbing spalling, saving crew members and preventing ammo detonations. Getting your gunner shot out is common, however, the breech of the autocannon is very small and therefore does not generally get knocked out. Losing too many crew members is common, as there are only 3 in the tank.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=786|rbMinHp=448}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has a maximum speed forward of 66 km/h or 49 km/h in battlefield conditions as well as -12 km/h in reverse. The transmission features 6 forward gears, 2 reverse as well as neutral steering. The vehicle is quite nimble and really only struggles to neutral steer in thick mud. Its lightweight allows it to traverse steep inclines with ease. It should be noted that the vehicles TOW missile launcher will automatically retract when the vehicle reaches speeds in excess of 10km/h.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The launcher contains two TOW missiles, which can be fired one after another in quick succession. Then, they are reloaded. Before you can fire, though, you have to be either stopped or moving at very low speeds, around 5 km/h. At higher speeds, the launcher folds up against the turret. When you stop, it takes time for the launcher to unfold before you can fire. This is where cruise control can be important. The first cruise control setting for forward and reverse speed is the \"battle\" setting. This controls the speed of the vehicle to where it is slow enough that you can fire the TOW missiles on the move. As before stated, this speed is very low, only about 5 km/h, so you should probably not drive in this mode of cruise control for the whole battle.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[BGM-71A TOW]] missile\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nOne way the Bradley can be played is as an ambush vehicle. Find a good location where you have sufficient protective cover to secure your position, but where you can see at least one lane of attack that the enemy is likely to use. Since you will be sitting still, your TOW launcher will be deployed, and you can fire TOW missiles whenever you need to. The best way to use the TOW missiles is to hit the enemy in the side. Two TOW missiles to the side should almost always kill a tank if well aimed.\n\nAnother way to use the Bradley is to get hull down, at long range and use the TOW launcher to deadly effect. Since you do not have to calculate for drop for ATGMs, you should be able to reliably hit your target and do major damage. Because you are firing at such long-range, it is likely the enemy will not spot you in time to shoot at you, or they will miss at least their first shot.\n\nThe Bradley can also be used effectively in urban combat. If you pick a side street to set up, when the enemy goes past, hopefully without seeing you, you will be able to hit them in the side with the TOW launcher.\n\nIn arcade mode, the Bradley can be used very effectively as an anti-aircraft vehicle. Since in arcade you get a lead indicator, you should be able to accurately hit planes and helicopters. When using the HEI-T* ammunition one to two hits is usually fatal for an aircraft. TOW missiles can be used to great effect against helicopters as well, but it is probably smarter to save the ATGMs for ground targets. Also, it can be hard to hit a moving helicopter with an ATGM for someone who's inexperienced with ATGMs.\n\nOne last note: the TOW missiles should be your primary weapon, not your autocannon. Firing the autocannon will likely give away your position instantly, so unless you have already been seen, or if you know you can kill the target quickly, do not use the autocannon. The autocannon can not effectively destroy tanks but is mostly just effective against SPAA's and light tanks. Those targets can also kill you very easily though, so it is almost always better to use the TOW missiles, in order to destroy the enemy tank quickly and efficiently. On the other hand, if an enemy tank is at close range, and has spotted you, you can often use the autocannon to damage or destroy their gun barrel with multiple, well-aimed, shots, to buy yourself more time.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Excels at urban combat, as the gun can be effective when engaging MBTs, except for the Russian MBTs\n* Massive radiator makes tank hull semi-invulnerable to APHE from the right side, can even survive 3 direct hits from the [[Maus]] if lucky enough\n* Outclasses stock 35 mm autocannon tanks which use API or APHE as long as long-range (about 1.1 km) and moderate front armour angle is kept, can even sustain low calibre APDS and HVAP hits from spaded light tanks if it has the high ground\n* Can fire missiles at \"combat\" cruise control, albeit only at about 5 km/h (can be considered as a downgrade after [[M551]], but still usable when compared to its peers)\n* 25mm autocannon can easily tear through light vehicles\n* TOW missiles capable of penetrating many tanks from the front with ease\n* Has a fast turret traverse and two-plane stabilizer, allowing for quick reaction times and accurate fire on the move\n* Slow ATGM allows for easier aiming onto target\n* Has access to first generation gunner thermals\n* Can fire two missiles in a row before reloading\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Additional side armour plates and turret frontal slope protect against 12.7 machine guns, but will always set off APHE, so caution is required\n* Low fire rate on the autocannon; faster than the British 30mm RARDEN but slower than the Russian 30mm 2A42 and most SPAA autocannons\n* Survivability is poor as with other IFVs; its autocannon belt is easy to hit and the vehicle is prone to overpressure\n* Relatively slow, especially in reverse\n* Large size makes it easy to spot\n* Engine, transmission, and driver at front of the vehicle are very prone to damage\n* Only has access to basic TOW missiles; struggles against later tanks with composite and explosive reactive armor\n* Cannot fire missiles on the move and must raise the launcher before firing\n* Low thermal sight resolution in comparison to the Warrior\n* Loud and noticeable engine sound\n* Default and M792 belts perform poorly against heavier targets\n* Prone to overpressure; explosive rounds with enough filler hitting the turret will usually knock it out\n* Does not have access to a laser rangefinder\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nDevelopment of the Bradley began in the late 1950s when the U.S. Army began seeking a replacement for the ageing M113 APC. However, despite beginning development relatively early, the successor to the M113 wouldn't enter service with the Army in the following two decades.\n\nThe reason behind this was the constantly changing specifications, requirements and doctrines around which the new vehicle would be designed. The constantly changing requirements, on the other hand, were driven by various technical and political problems arising during development.\n\nEventually, in 1979, the final design was presented to the Army and production was approved shortly afterwards in 1980. The Bradley, named after WW2 Army General Omar Bradley, was split into two versions, both closely resembling each other, but featuring minor differences and intended for different roles.\n\nWhile the M2 Bradley was intended as an IFV, capable of transporting and supporting infantry units in combat, the M3 Bradley CFV (Cavalry Fighting Vehicle) is intended to perform scouting and reconnaissance work, ditching its infantry-carrying ability in favour of improved communications systems and increased ammunition capacity.\n\nThe Bradley entered service with the U.S. Army in 1981 and saw extensive combat use during the Gulf War as well as subsequent conflicts. Despite several (unsuccessful) efforts being made to replace the Bradley with a newer design, the vehicle still remains in active service with U.S. armed forces today, with over 6,500 units produced.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5919-development-m3-bradley-the-modern-workhorse-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_m3_bradley Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200\">\nImage:M3 Bradley Explosion (1).jpg|<small>M3 Bradley hit by enemy fire</small>\nImage:M3 Bradley Explosion (2).jpg|<small>M3 Bradley hit by enemy fire</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|2h5kFyznXKU|'''Best IFVs''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:24 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|p6_wtLInMRc|'''{{PAGENAME}} - I Expected More''' - ''Napalmratte''|wpm0DcBWhIA|'''The Shooting Range #126''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:52 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Similar IFVs of other nations\n\n* [[Begleitpanzer 57]]\n* [[BMP-2]]\n* [[Warrior]]\n* [[Type 89]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5919-development-m3-bradley-the-modern-workhorse-en|[Devblog] M3 Bradley: The Modern Workhorse]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer FMC}}\n{{USA light tanks}}\n\n[[Category:ATGM vehicles]]"}}
