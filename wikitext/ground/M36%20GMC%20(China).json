If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nPlay style with the M36 should be about the same as the [[M10 GMC|M10]]. The speed is slightly better and armour is still just as thin, but it has an improved turret traverse rate and a 90 mm gun, making it able to engage targets much easier. The play style is also similar to the M18, since they have the same concept - speed and manoeuvrability with a powerful armament.\n\nThe greatest advantages of the M36 are its speed and its armament. As such, the best course of action is to make use of the speed to get to good early game positions on the map. The 90 mm gun is powerful at its BR, and it can penetrate many tanks at its BR from the front. But, this is not the case for more heavily armoured targets such as those in the IS series or the Panther series, but it can reliably kill every tank at its BR from the side in 1 to 2 shots because of the high explosive filler in the APCBC round. In addition, most enemy tanks can reliably penetrate you from the front, as the M36 does not have thick armour. Your armour can only protect you when a shell hits it at an extreme angle, or against low penetration weapons, such as those one some anti-aircraft vehicles. All of these factors mean that the M36 should never engage enemy tanks from the front, unless they are preoccupied with a friendly vehicle or not looking in your direction, but the M36 should engage enemies from the side. As such, the M36's mobility should be used to get to positions that the enemy would not expect where it will be able to shoot the enemy in the side before they even realize you are there. The M36 can also use its mobility to flank effectively. If an enemy knows your location and has an operational gun, you should not push out into their line of fire, as they are likely to come of better than you. If an enemy is likely to be able to shoot you, do not chance it, as only one shot will often knock out or disable the M36.\n\nIn a downtier, there are not a lot of heavily armoured tanks that the M36 can't penetrate, so the player can also choose to not flank, but to sit at a position and be a sniper. It's best to find a spot that:\n\n* Overlooks a key street / passageway where enemies will likely to pass / go to\n* Has hard cover or hill to hull-down\n* Has bushes to hide in\n* Is not too close to the frontline\n\nThis way when any enemy comes in sight, the M36 can easily finish it off, therefore \"locking down\" this key passageway, preventing the enemies to push and attack which gains a significant advantage to your team.\n\nOne thing to note: if there is an enemy plane in the vicinity, getting to cover is a priority as the turret is open topped, and a plane can kill all three turret crew in one pass with only low-calibre machine guns.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Easily achieves its top speed of 42 km/h regardless of the terrain, allowing it to get to most positions in good time\n* Excellent firepower with a maximum penetration of 173 mm and 137 g TNT; easily pens and one-shots most opponents like the [[Tiger H1]], Pz.IV 70 and the [[M4 Sherman (Family)|Shermans]], combined with its x5 scope magnification it is a deadly sniper\n* 10° gun depression provides great terrain adaptation.\n* Around 16°/sec of turret rotation is adequate to respond to surprise attacks\n* Powerful roof mounted M2 MG can deal with light vehicles and incoming planes\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Only 5 km/h of reverse speed can get the player killed sometimes\n* Weak armour overall, can die from artillery strikes or small bombs\n* Open topped, vulnerable to aircraft attacks\n* Quite big and tall for a tank destroyer- harder to hide\n* Does not have access to the better APCR like the American one\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
