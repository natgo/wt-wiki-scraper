If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe M36B1 is best used as support vehicle or flanker, it is heavily recommended that you play in Ground Realistic battles in this role, as in Arcade battles you'll be at a major disadvantage, due to enemies being able to spot you easier (as your nametag will be visible). At its battle rating, your armour won't be able to withstand much that comes towards you frontally. From the sides you are at your weakest point, experienced players will easily make short work of you by shooting where your ammo is stored. Another weakness is the fact that the M36B1 is an open-topped vehicle, meaning that artillery and enemies attacking from the air will be much more effective in eliminating you. So it is advised that you stick with teammates who are able to withstand hits. For tactics, although this vehicle is not the most mobile in the Italian tech tree, it can still be effective if in the right conditions. Not all is bad however: one of the upsides of this vehicle is the armament. This vehicle has access to a HEAT shell as its top tier round, which will be very effective for most tanks you'll face. With it, you can become a very effective, albeit not very fast, support flanker. If an enemy knows your location and has an operational gun, you should not push out into their line of fire, as they are likely to come off better than you. You aren't the most stealthy, and considering you dont accelerate very quickly either. Therefore make sure your enemy isn't aware of your presence before you engage, this will maximize your survivability and should allow you to stay in the battle for longer. Overall either stick with teammates and support, or flank the enemies and try to take out targets whilst being hidden.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The ideal candidate for this new role was the 90 mm M1 anti-aircraft gun, so in April 1942 the first prototype of the new vehicle was built based on a turret mounted directly on the hull of an M4 tank and armed with this gun. To evaluate the installation on an armoured vehicle, two examples of the M1 cannon were modified, subsequently this new weapon was standardized with the provisional abbreviation T7 to which became the M3 model. One of these two guns would be mounted on the prototype of the self-propelled M10 in order to evaluate the possibility of converting part of the production of this vehicle, and in fact no particular problems arose that suggested the opposite. However, it was decided to evaluate the possibility of creating a new turret because the M10 turret presented many balancing problems that made it difficult to continue using it. The task of making the new turret was entrusted to Chevrolet.\n\nOn December 9, 1942, the vehicle was standardized as \"90 mm Gun Motor Carriage T71\" when based on the hull of the self-propelled M10A1 (equipped with the Ford GAA petrol engine) and \"90 mm Gun Motor Carriage T71E1\" when based on the hull of the self-propelled M10 (equipped with the General Motors 6046 diesel engine made by combining two GM 6-71 commercial engines). In 1944, of these models, only the first was standardized which ended up becoming the \"90 mm Gun Motor Carriage M36\", due to the fact that the US Army was only willing to equip itself with petrol-powered tanks. The M36B1 version also first appeared in 1944, mounting the turret of the M36 on the hull of the M4A3 tank. The production of the M36 was continued up until December of 1944 when it ceased, with an estimated total of 1,400 units being made. In May 1945, due to the continuous demand of troops in Europe, the assembly line was reopened. Unfortunately due to the lack of M10A1 hulls, ones originating from M10 had to be used instead, therefore the M36B2 version was born which would be built in 672 units.\n\nIn Italian service, most of the M36B1's would be given by America under the \"M.A.P\" (Military assistance Program), since post-war Italy was scavenging for any military vehicles they could get their hands from. In some instances they managed to bring back several versions of Semoventes to reuse. Due to the M36B1 being used in limited numbers, there's not much documentation on their use, but they would likely have been on the frontlines if the Soviet Union had ever decided to actually invade.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=italy&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=tank_destroyer&vehicle=it_m36b1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[M4 Sherman (Family)]] - M4A3 variants\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:M36_tank_destroyer|[Wikipedia] M36 tank destroyer]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/US/M36_Jackson.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> 90mm GMC M36 Jackson]\n* [https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=251 <nowiki>[Military Factory]</nowiki> M36 Gun Motor Carriage (Jackson / Slugger)]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{Italy tank destroyers}}"}}
