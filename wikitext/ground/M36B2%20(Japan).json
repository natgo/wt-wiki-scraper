Multiple M36B2s were assembled at a depot in Akabane which would be shipped to the Korea peninsula to support South Korean and American forces.\n\nHowever, the tanks that the NPR received were too big for the average Japanese tanker. In order to replace the obsolete Sherman and Chaffee tanks, Japan got a M36B2 for research purposes to help develop a new domestically designed tank, which would eventually be developed into the [[Type 61]].\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{Japan tank destroyers}}"}}
