In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]].\n\nA premium variant of the M3A3 in the tech tree with the markings of the Chinese Expeditionary Forces (中國遠征軍)'s 1st Provisional Tank Group, it serves as a small and agile vehicle to harass enemies' flanks and a good scout vehicle for the main forces of your team.  \n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nAside from the naming of this vehicle and its delivery, it is identical to its main tech-tree counterpart. Having the minimal protection of a light tank (albeit sufficient to stop anything below 12.7x108mm up front) and sides which barely stops HMG rounds at longer ranges. It has at least 2 inches (25.4 mm) armor on its all-round while its turret is 1.25 inches (31.75 mm) all-around.\n\nBut to say at least: anything with 14.5x114 mm and beyond can tear down M3A3 with ease. So it is advised NOT TO go head-on against anything with a(n) (auto)cannon, flanking is the way to keep M3A3 from being knocked down into a smoking wreckage. \n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Soon after the total outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War (抗日戰爭) in 1937, and the later Southbound assault by the Imperial Japanese Forces in December 1941, the major blood line of the ROC at that time was the Burma Road (滇緬公路). It was still under construction and would certainly become a target of the Japanese forces. On 1941/12/23, the Sino-British Joint Defense Agreement on Burma Road (中英共同防禦滇緬路協定) was signed, leading to the establishment of the Expeditionary Forces to defend this vital supply line.\n\nAfter the bloody 1st expedition to Burma that resulted in severe casualties on the Nationalist forces (55k out of the 105k troops were lost), the remaining troops retreated back to Mainland China. While there were some troops in India, they were deemed insufficient to stop the menacing Japanese forces assaulting from Burma and into India; let alone retake the Burma Road. A year later, with the Sino-US joint command established in India with General Joseph Warren Stilwell in command, the Chinese garrison in India was then reformed as the New First Army (新一軍) with troops mobilized from Mainland China then transported to India via the Hump (駝峰航線). In October of 1943, the Sino-US 1st Provision Tank Group (中美第一臨時坦克群) was established at Ramgarh Cantonment in India with 6 tank battalions under their command; the unit was based on US Army order of battle but the battalions were composed of 3 light tank companies and 1 medium tank company instead, to fit the terrain of Burma and in view of lack of anti-tank weaponry from Japanese forces. They were first deployed in Walawbum in 1944/3/3 and successfully ran over (literary, it was remarked that the tank companies happened to ran over the command post of IJA forces among with most of their commanding officers) IJA's 18th Division (第18師團, which happened to be the one of the major culprits of the infamous Nanjing Massacre 南京大屠殺 on 1937/12/13); March 3rd is also the Armored Troops Day of ROCA due to this major victory. The joint forces then successfully reopen the Burma Road and eventually made it back to Mainland China in June of 1945, 2 months before the surrender of Japan. \n\nThis M3A3 delivery was the from the 2th tank of 3rd Company, 3rd Battalion, numbered USA 3027869 seen in Burma as of 1945.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* Skins and camouflages for the [[M3A3 Stuart (China)#Media|M3A3 Stuart (China)]] can be used for the {{PAGENAME}}.\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other M3A3 Stuarts\n\n* [[M3A3 Stuart (China)]]\n* [[M3A3 (Italy)]]\n* [[M3A3 Stuart (France)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{China light tanks}}\n{{China premium ground vehicles}}"}}
