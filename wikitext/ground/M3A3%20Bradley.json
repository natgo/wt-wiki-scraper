In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Ixwa Strike\"]]. The M3A3 variant differs mainly from the M3 Bradley by its laser rangefinder, its APFSDS belt for the 25 mm cannon, CITV, and more powerful TOW missiles.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe armour on the M3A3 is significantly upgraded compared to its predecessor, with additional armour plates all around the vehicle. These armour plates make the M3A3 almost impervious to heavy machineguns such as the M2HB and the DShK. However, any weapon that is about 14.5 mm in diameter or larger (i.e. SPAA, [[Leopard 2K]], ...) still poses a significant threat. As such, it is better to avoid taking hits when possible.\n\nAmmo is stored in large amounts throughout the tank, with 25 mm ammo containers lining the left side of the interior and additional BGM-71 ATGMs stowed on the right side. The loaded ammunition is stored just behind the turret crew, with a linked belt leading upwards into the breech. Penetrating hits that strike any of these ammunition stores have a high chance of setting the ammo off.\n\nThe engine, radiator, and transmission are positioned in the front of the tank, right side of the hull. These components can occasionally absorb hits from smaller calibre weaponry.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=942|rbMinHp=538}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n'''<big>Unlock order recommendations</big>'''\n\nThe order of modifications should be well thought out. Below is a guide of which modifications to unlock first, but it is just a recommendation and can be modified or adapted depending on the tank commander's preferences.\n\n'''Tier 1'''\n\nFor tier 1, only one modification is needed to progress to the next tier so it is recommended to just stick with parts as the first modification because it allows you to repair your tank in battle and also is very cheap, allowing you to move on to tier 2 very quickly.\n\n'''Tier 2'''\n\nAt tier 2, it is recommended to research NVD in order to allow for easy spotting of enemies in battle so that the M3A3 can survive longer and also get more kills (also making night battles viable). Alternatively, FPE can be researched before NVD in order to prevent the first two fires from knocking the M3A3 out of battle. After both of those modifications are unlocked one more is needed before you can progress to tier 3. Adjustment of fire is a good choice here but none of the remaining modifications (Suspension, Brake system, Airstrike) will make a huge difference so it is up to the vehicle commander.\n\n'''Tier 3'''\n\nOnce tier 3 is unlocked, the priority should be either Smoke grenades or TOW-2B depending on if the commander would rather have a chance of hiding his vehicle or would rather have a better weapon. The third modification from this tier that should be unlocked is either Filters in order to improve the mobility or Crew replenishment.\n\n'''Tier 4'''\n\nMoving on to tier 4, the commander can pick either the Engine mod or the APFSDS modification depending on whether improved mobility or firepower is preferred.\n\n'''Finishing up'''\n\nAfter those two are unlocked, the commander can pick whatever other modifications he/she wants as the remaining mods from all tiers are more minor than the ones that were prioritized. Tracks, transmission, laser rangefinder, horizontal drive, crew replenishment/filters (whichever wasn't chosen before), and ESS are all good modifications that can make a noticeable impact on the battle. The rest - suspension, brake system, airstrike, and the APDS belts - are all minor modifications that will not make much of a difference in battle and as such should be saved for last, in the order chosen by the commander.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe proper role of the M3A3 in battles is as a support vehicle. Because the secondary missile launcher deploys only when the vehicle is at a slow speed, the gameplay should be slower and farther away from the frontlines of the battlefield. The TOW-2B modification should be used to its best use, allowing for the player to easily compromise enemy sniper positions using their top down effect. The vehicle's scouting ability should also be used on hard to hit or far-away targets. A secondary use for the vehicle is in more close-quarters maps as a flanker, because the 25 mm cannon can easily penetrate the sides and rear of enemy tanks. Regarding survivability, even though the M3A3 has add-on armor compared to its predecessor, the M3 Bradley still doesn't have enough armor to defend against nearly all threats. The vehicle should be treated as if it can be killed from anywhere, from any round, in any place.\n\n'''Stock grind'''\n\nIn terms of gameplay, a stock M3A3 is actually not as different from a spaded one as with other vehicles. It is missing many abilities such as TOW-2B missiles, smoke grenades and ESS, engine horsepower, etc. But, the stock vehicle is still very deadly on the battlefield and can be useful to the team. First off, the stock M3A3 is not to be played on the front lines in most cases as it can not fire missiles on the move and also the APDS rounds in the stock 25 mm belt will not penetrate anything heavier than a light tank from the front. It should be played in the second line behind friendly tanks, scouting and supporting them with 25 mm rounds and missiles as needed. The TOW-2 missiles that come stock are great at knocking out tanks from the front, even ones that have ERA. The goal is to not be shot by the enemy but to get assists with the 25 mm gun and kills with the missiles while scouting targets for the team. If possible, flanking routes or long range hull-down sniping are also recommended to try and prevent the tank being hit by enemy fire. In summary, a much more cautious approach should be taken to prevent destruction by enemies and gain RP by getting assists and kills by supporting team mates.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Access to a full belt of 25 mm APFSDS shells - higher consistent performance against (the sides of) enemy vehicles than the M3 Bradley's mixed APDS/HEI-T belts\n* Commander can access and fire the main gun\n* Access to the fast travelling TOW-2B top-attack missile - capable of penetrating the weak top armour of enemy tanks, and targeting vehicles that are hiding behind cover\n* Access to excellent 2nd generation thermals for the gunner, commander, and even the driver\n* Good mobility and respectable reverse speed of -13 km/h\n* Scouting ability\n* Can use the engine smoke system (ESS) mechanic - deployment of a smoke screen by using the engine and its fuel\n* Can engage enemy aerial vehicles with the main gun due to +59° of gun elevation\n* -9° gun depression and a small turret mean you can effectively use hull down tactics\n* Laser rangefinder for the main gun\n* Great zoom of 4.0x - 12.0x and a good sight FOV of 18-6\n* The TOW-2B missiles, scouting mechanic and excellent thermals make the M3A3 very effective even at top tier\n* More armour than the M3 Bradley, can absorb up to 30 mm APDS (as fired by, for example, the BMP-2) in some places at range\n* Quick turret traverse\n* The 25 mm APFSDS belt excels against light vehicles and lightly armoured MBTs\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Slightly less mobile and less acceleration than the preceding M3 Bradley, due to the increase in weight\n* Continuously firing the main gun increases dispersion, thereby reducing accuracy\n* Low rate of fire for the main gun\n* Cannot fire missiles while moving at a speed greater than 4 km/h\n* Missile launchers take some time to deploy\n* Cannot reliably engage enemy MBTs from the front with 25 mm APFSDS\n* Despite the increase in armour over the regular M3, the armour is still thin and only 3 crew members - low survivability\n* Missiles can be detonated when hit by enemy fire, even while still in the launcher\n* Tall profile\n* Enemy vehicles equipped with thermals can see through ESS\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

As such, the Bradley received numerous upgrades to its electronic systems, including a new fire control system, a laser rangefinder and thermal imaging for the commander along with other improvements to the vehicle's protection and firepower.\n\nThe M3A3 modification of the Bradley started being shipped to the first U.S. Army units in 1998 with the first vehicles officially entering service in 2000. By late 2010, well over 3,300 Bradleys were converted to the A3 standard and the vehicle continues serving as one of the cornerstones of the U.S. armored units today.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_m3a3_bradley Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:M3A3 Bradley WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:M3A3 Bradley WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:M3A3 Bradley WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:M3A3 Bradley WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:M3A3 Bradley WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:M3A3 Bradley WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\nFile:M3A3 Bradley WTWallpaper 07.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|klTnC5qwPX4|'''The Shooting Range #248''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:29 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Khrizantema-S]]\n* [[Strf 9040 BILL]]\n* [[Dardo]]\n* [[VCC-80/30]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7048-development-m3a3-bradley-the-upgraded-warhorse-en|[Devblog] M3A3 Bradley: The Upgraded Warhorse]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer FMC}}\n{{USA light tanks}}\n\n[[Category:ATGM vehicles]]"}}
