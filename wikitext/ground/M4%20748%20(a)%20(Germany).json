It was available only for [[wt:en/news/356/current/|pre-order]] during the Closed Beta Test of Ground Forces during the period before [[Update 1.41]]. 500 units were also for sale during the [[wt:en/news/5079-special-hurry-up-and-get-rare-packs-en|5th Anniversary event]], which sold out within a few hours. Another 2,020 units went on sale in commemoration of the [[wt:en/news/6885-special-german-unity-day-en|30th anniversary of German Unity]], also selling out in a few hours. It represents a captured [[M4A2|M4A2 Sherman]] in Wehrmacht service and was the first Sherman to be implemented in the game. Unfortunately, it is currently impossible for a new War Thunder player to acquire this rare tank.\n\nThe M4 748 (a) plays like any other M4 Sherman as a mobile tank with adequate armour and gun. While its frontal armour and gun may not be up for the tasks against its contemporaries at its battle rating, the M4's mobility allows the M4 to get around the front line to capture the objective or hit the enemy in the sides. Though, if the heavy manoeuvring is not preferable, the M4 can also perform well as a supporting tank by backing up a more powerful tank to overwhelm a small enemy group.\n\nVisually, the M4 748 (a) is identical to the [[M4A2|M4A2 Sherman]]. The only big distinctive feature of the M4 748 (a) is the paint coat on the tank, which is a combination of the yellow ''dunkelgelb'', red-brown ''rotbraun'', and green ''olivgrün'', in a manner similar to the default scheme of the [[Panther G|Panther G]].\n\nFeatures on the M4 748 (a) are shared with its counterpart with a 47° front armour plate with a one-piece transmission housing. The turret features the M34A1 gun mount with the 75 mm M3 gun, the mount specified for a telescopic and periscopic scope. Unlike the [[M4|M4 Sherman model]] that has the same gun mount, the right turret side does not have a welded piece of applique armour, allowing for a more sloped contour on the 76 mm turret armour. The turret top features a spotlight on the front loader's position with his oval hatch while the commander has a usual split hatch with an M2 Browning machine gun for him to use.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe M4 748 (a) is a very versatile weapons platform that can be used in multiple roles and tactics. It can use its decent armour and gun to support friendlies against enemies, use its mobility to outmanoeuvre and exploit undefended location to reach an unsuspecting area, and a combination of the traits to deal with its contemporary medium tanks with the 75 mm gun with its APCBC and APCR ammunition.\n\nWhile most tanks in the BR range of the M4 748 (a) are quite capable of destroying the tank through the front, the most worrisome tanks are those that are quite immune to the 75 mm gun on the M4. APCR ammunition is given to the 75 mm gun, but its poor slope characteristics still make it situational ammunition than a universal tank annihilator. As such, exploiting side armour and general weak points of opposing tanks are still a must.\n\n:'''Exploitation'''<br>\n\nThe M4 748 (a) tank's mobility can be used to travel the distance on the battlefield in a satisfactory fashion. As the M4 748 (a) cannot stand against the more heavily armoured and armed enemies at the higher BR range, a manoeuvre around the enemy force or in a location prime for an ambush location can allow the M4 Sherman to damage or destroy enemy tanks. The engine power allows the M4 to travel across rough terrain to get to its destination. The only drawback in this action would be an unexpected encounter with another enemy trying the same manoeuvre, which would be an enemy tank class of equal to the M4 or lower so a good engagement against them could let the M4 continue its merry way.\n\n:'''Supporting'''<br>\n\nThere are many instances on a War Thunder battlefield where two opposing tanks face off against each other on a corner of cover, waiting for the other to pop out so it can deal a crippling blow with its gun or waiting for the other to prematurely fire so it can advance unhindered to a prime firing location. The M4 748 (a) can alleviate this problem by giving the friendly tank additional support. In this scenario, go around the enemy through another angle while the teammate keeps the enemy busy. This way, the M4 can go around and prepare itself for a firing solution on the enemy tank. This will either end with 1) a successful out-manoeuvre and the M4 landing a shot on the enemy's side and weak point while it was preoccupied with the ally, or 2) the tank is forced to turn its attention to the M4, leaving allies able to advance and do the same to get on the enemy's side.\n\nOn a larger battle scale with multiple allies and enemies, work in cohesion with the others behind the front lines as the allies absorb most of the enemy shots, allowing the M4 to line a perfect shot on a spent enemy to land a penetrating shot into the hull and knocking out the crew. Always aim for a crippling or defeating blow so that the enemy tank will not be an immediate threat to the rest of the team while it repairs or replenishes.\n\n:'''Capturing the Objective'''<br>\n\nWhile not as fast as some of the lighter tanks at the BR, the M4 748 (a)'s upgraded mobility makes it usable as a vehicle to run towards the objective and capture the zone. It has the decent firepower and armour to handle enemy light tanks that are expected to also rush towards points, and so it could last for some time capturing and defending the zones. However, once heavier tanks and contemporary medium tanks start arriving in droves, it is recommended to start withdrawing from the position or else the M4 will be overwhelmed and destroyed at the first priority due to being an easy target, even if allies are present to support the M4 on the position.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n* [[M4A2]] / [[M4A4 (1st PTG)|A4]]: These Sherman tanks are widely used by over three nations that spread across both the Allied and the Axis side, so no matter which nation is being played they can be quite tough to destroy in the hands of a skilled tanker. Given the rather weak penetration of the short 75 mm M3 gun, their hull can be almost impossible to penetrate when angled, hull down or 300 metres away. For a M4A4, there are 2 apparent bulges on the upper front plate, a penetration through there is a guaranteed knock-out most of the times. But in case the opponent covers them up or when it's an M4A2, aim for the middle parts of the gun mantlet or the turret armor unprotected by the mantlet to try and disable their gun or penetrate and take out the turret crew. Note that their guns are equally weak against another Sherman, so wiggle around to disrupt their aim while reloading to allow a good chance of bouncing some shells.\n* [[Churchill Mk I]], [[Churchill Mk III]]: The Churchills, with their complex hulls and sturdy turrets, can be quite hard to penetrate at range. Manoeuvre as close to them as possible, the ideal distance being no more than 200 metres. If they are angling their hull but facing their turret towards the M4 748 (a), only go for the turret. For the Churchill Mk I s, aim at the near-vertical part of their rounded cheeks to ensure successful penetrations. For the Mk III, also aim for their flat turret which is at most 89 mm thick. The shell should go in easily and knock out most, if not all of the crew. Only when the Churchill's hull is facing towards the player without any angling should there be an attempt to shoot the hull, otherwise shoot the turret only, as their big tracks can easily get in front of the frontal hull and spoil a shot. The side hull have multiple layers of armour, some of which are weirdly angled and can absorb plenty of shells.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Excellent gun depression of -10° plus the angled frontal turret allows it to utilise hills very well\n* Great penetration and post-penetration damage when using M61 shells; can frontally penetrate and one-shot most opponents like the [[T-34 (Family)|T-34,]] Crusader, [[M4]] and others\n* Vertical stabiliser allows it to fire on the move, or, in a sudden encounter, fire before the enemy which is critical\n* Well angled frontal armour; when angling the hull it can deflect some low calibre / low-penetrating shells like the Stuarts' 37 mm, 75 mm M1, 76 mm F-34 / Zis-5 and others\n* Adequate top speed allows it to get to positions in time, or to do tactical manoeuvres like flanking\n* Rather fast reload speed for follow up shots\n* Plenty of reserve ammunition for prolonged fighting without replenishing at captured points\n* Due to it being a part of the German tech tree, will not have to face the long barrel 75 mm (RB/SB) which increases its survivability quite a bit\n* Inexperienced players might mistake it for an allied Sherman, especially in RB and SB\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Large profile and weak side armour; flankers like the M24 Chaffee can easily see and penetrate it\n* Frontal armour is still inadequate, will get frontally penetrated and one-shot by tanks like Achilles, [[M10 (Family)|M10]] and T-34-57\n* The best M61 shell struggles to penetrate heavy targets like [[KV-1 (ZiS-5)]], Churchill Mk.III or even the T-34 and M10 when angled\n* Trajectory is curved and velocity is low due to its short barrel, thus distant/moving targets are hard to shoot at\n* Hull traverse is quite slow, making it sluggish in a turn\n* Roof armour of 19.5 mm thick is vulnerable to airstrikes with AP cannons. For example the widely used [[M2 Browning (12.7 mm)|M2 Browning]]\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This equipment, if salvageable, are often taken by the occupiers and used for their own purposes. The Allies mostly captured German vehicles for use in gun tests and target practice, with the Soviets going as far as fielding captured tanks in their own ranks such as the [[Pz.III J|Panzer III]] as the [[T-III (USSR)|T-III]]. The German forces also captured Allied tanks as well, mostly fielding them in the Panzer forces to supplement the growing attrition of their armoured forces. The [[M4A2|M4 Sherman]], one of the most common tanks in the Allied forces, was often captured and fielded by the German forces. The fielded Shermans in the German army was given the designation '''M4-748(a)'''.\n\n===Combat usage===\nIt is unknown exactly how many Shermans have been captured and used by the German forces during World War II, but the German-captured Shermans have been documented in the battlefields of Tunisia, Italy, France, Soviet Union, and in Germany itself in the last days of the war. The Shermans were reported to be used in the 14th Panzer Division, 16th Panzer Division, Fallschirmjäger Division, and Kampfgruppe Berlin. When used by the Germans, the Shermans were often painted with ''Balkenkreuz'' cross symbol of the Wehrmacht to distinguish between friend and foe.\n\nThe German captured M4 Sherman's most notable combat performance was in the Ardennes Offensive in December 1944, the Baltic Offensive against the Soviet Union in late 1944, and the Battle of Berlin. The Shermans were also reported to play a role as armour-recovery vehicles rather than tanks due to Sherman's great power-to-weight ratio and reliable design that allows for the ability to tow the heavier German vehicles reliably.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe American M4A2 medium tank is a variant of the M4 with a diesel engine. In April 1942, the first M4A2 prototype was tested, and the tank was put into production. The tank had a welded hull. A low-speed diesel engine gave the M4A2 good cross-country ability and a much larger maximum range than tanks with gasoline engines.\n\nA total of 8053 of these tanks were built. About 2000 of them were delivered to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program.\n\nThis vehicle was actively used in combat operations on the Eastern Front. Sometimes, entire tank battalions were made up of this tank.\n\nCaptured serviceable tanks were used by the Wehrmacht as subdivision command vehicles and sometimes even full-fledged combat vehicles. Captured M4A2 tanks served with the self-propelled artillery regiment of the 14th Armored Division of the Wehrmacht and with the 15th Parachute Division of the Luftwaffe. Most of the tanks were marked with an Iron Cross to show they belonged to the German army. Some tanks were repainted to match the standard camouflage schemes of the German army. The armor protection of these tanks was often supplemented with spare treads.\n\nCaptured M4-748 (a) tanks were used by German troops until the end of the war. The divisions of the Wehrmacht had several such tanks which survived until Germany surrendered.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=germany&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=medium_tank&vehicle=us_m4a2_1944_germ Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Y3VN38sg2-g|'''Super Rare Tank - M4 748 (a)''' (starts at 02:10) - ''ThunderKing''|nDsevMd8aAo|'''M4 748 (a): Rugged relic''' - ''Oxy''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[M4]]\n* [[M4A2]]\n* [[Calliope]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the tank;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [http://beutepanzer.ru/Beutepanzer/us/M4_sherman/m4-75-sherman-01.htm <nowiki>[Beutepanzer.ru]</nowiki> Medium tank M4 (75mm) \"Sherman\" Panzerkampfwagen M4-748 (a)]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{Germany medium tanks}}\n{{Germany premium ground vehicles}}"}}
