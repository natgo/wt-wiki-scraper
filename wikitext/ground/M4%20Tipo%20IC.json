Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]]. Composito translates to \"composite\", as this is a Firefly variant built on the Sherman I Hybrid (or M4 Composite) hull.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Hull Front, turret, turret cupola)\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull sides, rear and roof, add-on bustle, turret roof)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The armour is not strong for the battle rating and most enemies, save for SPAA, will go right through the front. If the tank is penetrated it is likely that at least two of the five crew will survive, depending on where the shot hits and how much HE filler it has. The gun breech is quite large, and it can often save the crew members on one side from the shrapnel of a penetration to the other side of the turret. Additionally, almost all the ammunition is stored in the hull floor, while a minority is stored in the turret basket; this means it is unlikely for the ammunition to explode under most circumstances. Despite these factors, almost every penetration will cause crippling damage - either immobilizing the tank or disabling the main gun, which allows the enemy to take a second finishing shot soon after. In summary, the survivability of the {{PAGENAME}} is not to be relied upon as it will rarely survive two shots and will almost never bounce a shot. As such, you should plan your route in order to avoid frontal engagements with the enemy.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

The player can be confidently rely on the mighty 17-pounder gun to effectively neutralize other tanks regardless of the angles (including the frontal armour of the Tiger or the T-34s). It excels at sniping from a distance and can also can spearhead an attack if needed.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\nR3 T20 FA-HS (AB / mixed RB):\n\nThis speedy wheeled vehicle can circle around you with ease and wipe out all your crew with its fast firing autocannon. In a close encounter, never expose your side to it, and do not even angle your hull. Face your hull directly to the R3, because on each side of the cast hull, above the inducer wheel there is a triangular area that blends and connects the upper front plate to the side. By angling the hull, this triangle becomes unangled to the R3, making it easily penetrated, and the driver / gunner will usually get knocked out first. It is harder for the R3 to penetrate your unangled hull thus giving you more time to react and destroy it.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

After WW2, Italy was supplied with tanks by the US and UK, such as the [[Sherman Firefly]] (designated as M4 Tipo IC or [[Sherman Vc (Italy)|M4 Tipo VC]] depending on the variant) and [[M24 (Italy)|M24 Chaffee]], which were commissioned in 1947. At that time, Italy created the first nucleus for the formation of a tankers school and on the 1st of October officially formed the Military School Organization.\n\nThe M4 Tipo ICs were decommissioned and scrapped in 1952.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_sherman_VII Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n[[File:The British Army in the Normandy Campaign 1944 .jpg|thumb|none|350px|<small>A British Firefly during the Normandy Campaign 1944<ref>http://www.theshermantank.com/sherman/the-firefly-the-teapot-with-teeth/</ref></small>]]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Ege0ylN0RCA|'''Lookback: {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''Orangefan''|YK_kiOv7cJo|'''{{PAGENAME}} Composito, Italian, Tier-3, Medium Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same gun & turret\n\n* [[Sherman Firefly]]\n* [[Sherman IC \"Trzyniec\"]]\n* [[Sherman Vc (Italy)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[M4A1 (76) W]]\n* [[M4A4 (SA50)]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Department of Tank Design}}\n{{Italy medium tanks}}"}}
