In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]].\n\nThe Chinese M42 Duster is identical to the US version. Compared to other SPAA vehicles (like the [[Phòng không T-34]], [[Wirbelwind]], [[M16 MGMC|Multiple Gun Motor Carriage M16]], etc...), the M42 is typically regarded as one of the less effective AAs, due to its very exposed crew and mediocre rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute.\n\nIf used as a light tank, the M42 does not have the armour to stand up directly to many of the other vehicles which it will face on the battlefield, especially against tanks which may fire high-explosive shells. The Duster will fare better against machine gun fire and potentially against some of the lighter autocannon fire which it may encounter, though not for long. Due to the M42's lightweight nature, it is best to stay around cover to help shield the Duster. It is also essential to only expose the vehicle when necessary to get a shot. If discovered, it is best to have a contingency location to which to fall back and regroup.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nArmour may as well be non-existent on the M42. Built off the chassis of the [[M41A1|M41 Walker Bulldog]], the SPAA can be penetrated by anything in the game, except for those few tanks armed with only machine guns, of course. In this tank, speed is your armour. A stationary Duster is a scrapped Duster unless you're firing on an aircraft, in which you should stop behind some cover.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Either way, it's fast. Being built with neutral steering and lighter than the M41A1. It should take no difficulty to get out of a situation in a pinch.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

They have a decent rate of fire and you will seldom have to stop and wait for a reload - more likely, you'll have to wait for the gun barrel to cool down. Against aircraft, these guns are deadly. A shot or two will be more than enough to shoot down an enemy. They are also quite deadly against lightly armoured vehicles, such as enemy SPAAs or light tanks such as the [[Ru 251|Spähpanzer Ru 251]] or [[M41A1|M41 Walker Bulldog]], and you can pen the side of [[Panther A|Panthers]], too. However, they require direct hits. Against the Soviet heavy or British medium tanks you are likely to encounter, however these guns will do nothing for you. You will rarely get an opportunity to use the Bofors on another tank, as they simply lack the penetration to do so - 72 mm doesn't get you very far at Rank IV. If you can get the guns to hit, you should have no trouble knocking aircraft out of the sky.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[Dual Automatic Gun M2 (40 mm)|40 mm Dual Automatic Gun M2]] (x2) || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Refrain from attacking enemies that can take a hit from you, unless you like getting \"Hit +10SL +5RP\". You can roam around the battlefield with your insane speed and act as a scout. Ironically, shooting enemies you know will bounce, you have a reason for it because it makes them show up on the mini-map for all players to see, although it will also expose you. However, you could stay with your teammates and shoot down planes that will be harassing them - they will see you, with your open-top and exposed crew, and think of you as an easy target. They know the danger of the Bofors guns but for some pilots that is a gamble, they are willing to take. A good way to lure planes toward you is the act like you don't see them - shoot off at some distant (ground) target, at which the plane will notice you are \"distracted\" and dive to attack you, where you can show them the error of their ways in the form of the 40mm Bofors cannon.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

In order to prevent the CCP from invading the Republic of China by force, the United States assisted Taiwan with a wide-range of military equipment including the TM-61 \"Matador\" surface-to-surface missiles, the M42 Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns, and the M55 self-propelled howitzers. After receiving the M42 SPAAG, the ROC armed forces assigned it to the divisional Air Defense Battalion units and the Marine Corps for low-altitude air defense tasks.\n\n=== ...Perish in soft living ===\nIn 1998, the 205 arsenal of the ROC Joint Logistics Command developed the T82 twin 20 mm Air Defense Cannon. At the same time, the Army purchased the Avengers Air Defense Missile System from the United States to construct a new air defense system. Thus, the outdated M42 SPAAGs started to retire from service. However, due to the insufficient number of the Army's field air defense missiles, some of the M42 SPAAGs in the air defense battalion of the Army's Artillery Group were still in service along the \"Jaeger\" anti-aircraft missile system until around 2012. By 2012, all M42 SPAAGs in the Army were replaced by T82T towed Air Defense Cannons. However, the Marine Corps units stationed on the outer islands such as Matsu kept using M42 SPAAG as infantry support vehicle until at least 2017.\n\n''(Thrive in calamity and perish in soft living is a Chinese saying.)''\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the tank;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{China anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
