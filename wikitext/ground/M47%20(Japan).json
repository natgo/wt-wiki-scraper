It was introduced in [[Update \"Red Skies\"]].\n\nAn M47 was sent by the US to Japan for trials to evaluate its potentials as the JGSDF was looking for a new medium tank design. The Japanese instead adopted the [[Type 61 (Family)|Type 61]], which took design inspiration from the Patton.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe M47 is often considered a \"glass cannon\". With a powerful gun but poor armour, it is recommended to play this vehicle carefully and conservatively. As such, it is often beneficial to use an ambush or flanking-based playstyle. Attacking enemies from soft or hard cover without being seen can maximize this tank's capabilities. \n\nTankers that have experience with the [[ST-A1]], [[ST-A2]] and to the same degree the [[Type 61]] and [[ST-A3]] will already be familiar with this vehicle's playstyle. The armour might be somewhat stronger than the previously mentioned vehicles but for the difference in BR and rank between them, it's about as effective against the tanks it will encounter at its BR.\n\nThe stock M318A1 APBC shell is relatively weak compared to shells used by other vehicles. While working towards the improved M431 HEATFS shell, it is advisable to shoot at enemies' tracks and gun barrels if the main hull is too armoured for the APBC shell to penetrate. Doing so will help to incapacitate your enemies and allow your better-armed teammates to destroy them. Additionally, the M47 shouldn't have trouble dealing with soft targets. With two .50 cal [[M2HB (12.7 mm)|M2HB]] machine guns in addition to the [[M36 (90 mm)|90 mm M36]] main cannon, [[:Category:Light tanks|Light Tanks]] and Armoured Cars can be dispatched with ease. (On a side note, these machine guns can be used to spot enemy targets, alerting your team to their presence.)\n\nOnce the HEATFS shell is unlocked, the M47 can be played more like a classic medium tank. There will be few vehicles that the upgraded shell cannot penetrate. It is recommended to play near friendly vehicles in case support is needed. Even with an upgraded shell, the M47 is not a lone wolf and can suffer without the backup of its allies.\n\nThe M47 has above-average mobility, and achieving flanking positions should not pose too much difficulty. However, the tank does have a high profile, which can allow it to be spotted more easily. Combined with the vehicle's poor armour, this makes it especially important to stay out of the enemy's sight.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Previously issued with surplus WWII-era American vehicles like [[M4A3 (76) W (Japan)|M4A3 Shermans]], [[M24 (Japan)|M24 Chaffees]], M15A1 CGMCs and other equipment, the JGSDF (Japanese Ground Self Defence Forces) would want to gain a step up in tank development as the communist threat in Korea loomed close to the Japanese homeland. The JGSDF would attempt to get their hands on a new American medium tank that would become a staple of the Cold War, the M47 'Patton II'. Unfortunately for the Japanese, the American assembly lines for the tank were already backlogged with various other foreign orders, primarily from West Germany.\n\nDue to the situation, the JGSDF started working on the prototype [[Type 61 (Family)|STA]] medium tank series which eventually culminated in the [[Type 61]] MBT. During development, a single [[M47|M47 'Patton II']] was eventually sent to Japan for comparison to the domestic ST-A models. It isn't properly documented when this vehicle arrived in Japan but it has been speculated to have done so sometime in-between the completion of the [[ST-A1]]/[[ST-A2|2]] (1957) and the development of the [[ST-A3]]/4 (1960). After Japan was done with prototyping and adopting the Type 61, the M47 lost its purpose in the JGSDF and was sent to be scrapped. \n\nRemarkably, however, it was purchased by a private collector and the tank was saved before it could be destroyed. While they may not have been the original collector as said person or organization was never specified, the M47 ended up in the private collection of Nakata Shoten Shop. Located in one of their warehouses in the Tokyo Metropolis, the \"Patton II\" resides alongside several other vehicles used as evaluation and service vehicles in the JSDF: an M37 HMC, an [[M36 GMC]], an [[M41A1 (Japan)|M41A1]], and an M59 APC. \n\nWhile it's likely that the other vehicles were also deactivated due to Japanese civilian weapon control laws, the M47 in Tokyo is known to have been modified in ways that prevent it from being able to move or fire. Some of the changes include the breech being cut, the transmission and engine being removed, and multiple 10 centimetre-wide holes being drilled into the floor.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other M47s\n* [[M47]]\n* [[MKPz M47 G]]\n* [[M47 (105/55)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\t\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/eeue4y/the_japanese_m47/ Reddit post on M47]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{Japan medium tanks}}"}}
