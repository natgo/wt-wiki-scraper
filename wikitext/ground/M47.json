With a powerful gun, but weak armour, this vehicle should be played carefully, and out of sight of the enemy. As such, it is often beneficial to use an ambush or flanking-based play-style. Attacking enemies without being seen will maximize this tank's capabilities.\n\nThe stock APBC shell is quite weak compared to the shells used by the M47's enemies. While working towards the much better HEAT-FS shell, it is advisable to shoot for enemies' tracks and gun barrels if the main hull is too-well protected for the APBC shell to penetrate. Doing so will help to incapacitate your enemies and support your better-armed teammates. Additionally, the M47 should never have any trouble dealing with soft targets. With two 12.7 mm machine guns in addition to the main cannon, light tanks and armoured cars can be dispatched with ease. (On a side note, these machine guns can be used to spot enemy targets, alerting your team to their presence.)\n\nOnce the HEAT-FS shell is unlocked, the M47 may be played more like a classic medium tank. There will be few vehicles that the upgraded shell cannot penetrate. It is recommended to play near friendly vehicles, in case support is needed--even with an upgraded shell, the M47 is not a lone wolf, and will suffer without the backup of its allies.\n\nThe M47 has above-average mobility, and achieving flanking positions should not pose too much difficulty. However, the tank does have a high-profile, making it easily spotted. Combined with the vehicle's poor armour, this makes it especially important to stay out of the enemy's sight.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The basis of this design was the [[M26|M26 Pershing]], which was deemed insufficiently mobile for its role as a medium tank. The M46 was mainly the M26 Pershing with a new engine, transmission, and a redesigned 90 mm gun. While a good solution for the lacking M26 Pershing design, it was only considered a stopgap solution while the experimental ''T42 medium tank'' was being developed. However, the Korean War put a stop in that development due to an urgent need of tanks, so the T42 project, which would produce a completely new tank design, was put on hold.\n\nAn interim decision was made to mount the turret from the T42 onto the hull of the M46 Patton, this modified tank was designated the '''M47 Patton''' and entered production in 1951. A common nickname for the tank was the ''Patton II'', due to the same name as the M46 Patton, this was changed to ''Patton 47'' a few weeks later. The M47 Patton featured most of the armament seen from the M26 Pershing and M46 Patton, with a 90 mm gun and a coaxial and hull-mounted .30 cal machine gun, and a .50 cal machine gun on top of the turret. The M47 Patton has the distinction of being the last American tank with the hull-mounted machine gun on the bow. The new turret required the hull to be redesigned with a larger turret ring and had a \"needle-nose\" design with the turret mantlet heavily sloped towards the cannon, the design's heavy sloping nature also helped improve protection. The turret also had a large protrusion at the back to act as storage. An M12 stereoscopic range finder was also mounted on a turret, which was difficult to use, but would appear in every American tank design from here on until the M1 Abrams design.\n\nThough technically a medium tank by the army standards, a new standardization in US Army tank designation on November 9, 1950, had the entire system changed from the weight of the tank to the calibre of the vehicle's gun. Therefore in the 1950s, the \"Medium Tank M47 Patton\" name was changed to '''90 mm Gun Tank M47 Patton'''. This designation would go on for future American tank designs. The M47 Patton began production in June 1951 before its standardization at the Detroit Tank Arsenal. Delays in the production schedule caused a long period of testing to occur until it was standardized in May 1952. Production ran until November 1953 with a total production number of more than 9,000 M47 Pattons between Detroit and Alco.\n\n===Usage===\nThe M47 Patton came out only a year before the improved M48 Patton. Because of this, the M47 was declared a \"limited standard\" in American service, and those still in American hands were replaced by the M48 Patton tanks. It was declared obsolete by 1957 and were only retained by infantry divisions until replaced by anti-tank missiles in the 1960s. The M47 Patton was given out in large numbers to a number of countries in NATO and SEATO, such as Pakistan, Jordan, Turkey, Iran, Croatia, France, West Germany, and Spain. The M47 Patton would see service in combat in both Indo-Pakistani Wars, the Six Day War, the Iran-Iraq war, the Invasion of Cyprus, and the Croatian War of Independence. Today, they are still being used in Spain as armour recovery vehicles in artillery and infantry units.\n\nThe M47 Pattons were promising new designs developed from the M46 Pattons to improve its combat capabilities with a newer turret. However, it did not serve much in America due to the M48 Patton development, which was a completely new design and had nearly no identical parts with its predecessor. It served very well in other countries as their primary armour forces, but those left in the states were used as targets in firing ranges, mainly for training or as tests for future anti-tank developments. In the 1970s, one was tested against the [[M60|M60 Main Battle Tank]], the successor to the M48 Patton, and its 105 mm L7 gun. The HEAT round fired from the gun penetrated the frontal armour of the M47 Patton with relative ease, armour which was considered superb at its time of introduction. The test went on with many M47 tanks and would prove that conventional steel armour in tank warfare was becoming obsolete in the face of new tank ammo.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe M47 Patton II medium tank, released in the US beginning in June 1951 by the Detroit Tank Arsenal and the American Locomotive Co., was a modernized version of the M46 Patton.\n\nThe M47's frontal hull sheets were more sloped, while infrared viewfinders and a heater were added for the crew. The construction for the cast turret was also updated: it took a step forward from the M46, though the builders reduced its interior space in order to add a cupola and reloader's hatch in its overhangs. As a result, indentations were made that proved excellent at catching shells. That error was rectified for the M48 by making the turret fully domed, similar to the Soviet T-54. The tank's armament was reinforced by modernizing the 90 mm cannon, resulting in an initial velocity of over 900 m/s. The M47 hull also differed from the M46: its front section was more streamlined, while the fan hood between the driver and gunner disappeared. Engine power was added, though the tank's top speed remained the same (although the average terrain it encountered was somewhat higher).\n\nAs a result, the M47 did not become standard for American tank construction, and it was quickly replaced in its limited role for the US Army (two divisions in West Germany) by the M48. However, it was actively distributed among NATO countries and other US-dependent allies, resulting in total production of 8,676 units.\n\nThe M47 Patton II was part of the West German, Austrian, French, Italian, Belgian, Spanish, Jordanian, Japanese, and Turkish armies.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=usa&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=medium_tank&vehicle=us_m47_patton_II Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Xwid3UCLr5U|'''The Patton Family''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:42 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|2RhXj2rTBqM|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[mKPz M47 G]]\n* [[M47 (105/55)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[M46]]\n* [[M46 \"Tiger\"]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:M47_Patton|[Wikipedia] M47 Patton]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/us/m47_patton.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> 90mm Gun Tank M47 Patton II]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{USA medium tanks}}"}}
