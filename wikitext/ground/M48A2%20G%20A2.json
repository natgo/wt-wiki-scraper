Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 \"The Valkyries\"]]. It was born from the adaptation of the 105 mm L7A3 cannon on the already available M48A2 platform together with a new fire control system.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

The sides are decently armoured, but not thick enough to make angling the hull a valid tactic. Some thin vents on the top of the hull are vulnerable to strafing runs by enemy aircraft, which may cause engine fires. While the M48 hull has more armour than the Leopard 1, at this B.R., this is largely irrelevant as most of your opponents will be carrying APFSDS. Sustained enemy fire will quickly result in your destruction. Despite this, the hull UFP is decent and can protect you from 100mm APHE rounds. However, as mentioned above, this can not be relied upon and any bounces are the exception rather than the rule.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

It's a decent medium tank with a well sloped frontal armour, average mobility but what makes M48A2 G A2 stand out is the upgraded engine giving it a better mobility and a upgraded gun a [[L7A3 (105 mm)|105 mm L7A3]] compared to the US standard [[M41 (90 mm)|90 mm M41]] giving it an improved penetration and increased precision against distant targets. But with this improvement comes with a drawback, compared to the other [[M48 Patton (Family)|M48]]'s battle rating the M48A2 G A2 got a higher battle rating facing a lot more dangerous enemies than the other M48 versions. But luckily for the M48A2 G A2 it can unlock DM23 rounds that have a great effect on enemy vehicles at higher battle ratings when uptiered, and can penetrate their armour with well placed shells.\n\nArmour of the M48 is round and well sloped decreases the chance for certain shells to punch through the armour with reliability, though the tank have some significant weak spot on the front. The lower glacis the weakest part of the front, making it a desirable location for hostile tanks to fire at to knock out the M48A2 G A2 with ease. Keeping in mind to protect the lower glacis as best as possible from enemy shells. The armour holds it ground at 7.3 battle rating against tanks with no APFSDS or APDS since these shells penetrate its frontal hull and turret armour with ease. The armour all around is decent compared to tanks like [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]], [[Vickers MBT]] and [[OF-40]].\n\nPlaying the M48A2 G A2 is a great risk to be uptiered and face enemies like [[Radkampfwagen 90]], [[Merkava (Family)|Merkava]], [[T-72A]] and [[OF-40 Mk.2A]] all having better mobility and speed than the old M48 Patton, they also have the advantage to be equipped with stabilizers that the M48A2 G A2 are not equipped with, making it an easy target for most tanks when it is unfortunate to be used in a 9.3 battle rating battle. In those battles it's wise to not advance blindly into enemy and more take a careful approach, take up a position where the M48A2 G A2 got the capability to get the first shot.\n\nIn 7.3-8.3 battles the M48A2 G A2 can be used more aggressive, but it's still advised to not advance too fast, with certain vehicles also at that battle can be equipped with stabilizers and can get in a well placed shot on the move compared to the non-stabilizer tanks, these can have a big advantage over the M48A2 G A2 when it comes to brawling and engage the tanks while having speed advantage and mobility to avoid incoming fire from a moving M48A2 G A2.\n\nM48A2 G A2 can be a tricky tank to use effective in battle, lacking a Stabilizer is a big disadvantage at its 8.3 battle rating but it can still be a effective tank for defending captured points or take up a \"Sniper\" position where it can be relatively safe from enemies.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Originally this tank included the 90 mm M41 cannon and a 750 HP engine. Later on the tank would receive an upgraded engine (from 750 HP to 825 HP) along with other changes and was designated the M48A2 C in German service. This tank served from the early 1960s to the late 1970s. West Germany realized that the 90 mm gun wasn't sufficient enough to deal with most of the top of the line Soviet MBTs, so in 1978 the tank received the German licensed built, 105 mm L7A3 gun found on the Leopard 1. Other changes included minor fire control system changes, a new commander hatch, passive night sights, and later on a laser rangefinder. This version was designated the M48A2 G A2 and remained in service till the 1990s.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_mkpz_m48a2ga2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Xwid3UCLr5U|'''The Patton Family''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 6:57 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|O1TRhFRl9z0|'''{{PAGENAME}} - Mr 2 Face''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[M48 Patton (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Chrysler Defense}}\n{{Germany medium tanks}}"}}
