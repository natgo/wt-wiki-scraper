It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5162-development-m4a1-fl10-the-charming-sherman-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]] and was removed from the store after the [[wt:en/news/7154-shop-may-sale-in-the-gaijin-store-en|2021 May sale]]. It was made available for purchase in-game with Golden Eagles {{ge}} for the [[wt:en/news/7775-special-bastille-day-en|2022 \"Bastille Day\"]] mini-event.\n\nThe M4A1 (FL10) combines the oscillating turret of the [[AMX-13]] with the hull of the [[M4A1]] Sherman and therefore epitomizes the glass cannon role at its BR.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.\n** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 6 into rack 8* then 7*.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nDepending on the layout of the map, match battle rating and player's own playstyle the FL10 can be used as a sniper, a flanker or a close-quarter brawler. Details about playstyles are as follows:\n\n;Sniper\n\n*Using FL10 as a sniper is a conservative, but commonly rewarding playstyle. The FL10 boasts a highly potent 75 mm cannon, with an equally impressive round, capable of penetrating 180+ mm of steel equivalent. Given the fast reload of the cannon due to the use of the autoloader, it is possible to perform quick follow-up shots on target at range. This tactic is recommended in matches where it is possible to position oneself in a good position early in the match (e.g. overlooking a point). Be wary of the gun's average depression, however, as this will require to expose the hull during firing.\n\n;Flanker\n\n*Depending on your knowledge of the map and likely enemy routes,  FL10 can be effectively used as a flanker. The FL10 inherits a relatively mobile chassis of an M4 medium tank making some flanking manoeuvres possible. In this role, FL10 can be used to assume an ambush position on the flanks. It is important to note, that FL10 is not the most agile vehicle at its battle rating, however, provided a good early-game position, fast reload and good penetration it can effectively engage an enemy from the flanks and counter enemy flankers. It is advised to retreat immediately if you're spotted as FL10 is unlikely to withstand being fired upon due to mediocre armour and 4 crew members.\n\n;Brawler\n\n*Using FL10 as a close-quarter brawler is a high risk/high reward tactic that is likely to result in either multiple kills or an early return to the hangar. It is important to fire the first shot on the enemy, as, given the poor armour of the tank, you are commonly unable to withstand even one hit. Here, it is advised to disable the enemy's gun/turret first to prevent them from returning fire. It is important to note, that FL10 lacks the stabiliser found on the American Sherman counterparts, putting the player at a further disadvantage when fighting in close quarters.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* 4 smoke grenades.\n* Improved engine gives good mobility.\n* Potent gun with a high penetration power.\n* Quick rate of fire thanks to the autoloader (12 shells).\n* The best shell is available as stock shell (like many French tanks at ranks III and higher).\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Overall thin armour and only 4 crew members limit your survivability.\n* Turret armour too thin to stop 20 mm or HMG fire from strafing aircraft.\n* Lacklustre reverse speed: disengaging from the fight when damaged or out of ammunition can be difficult.\n* Oscillating turret means that from a full stop, the M4A1 (FL10) usually takes longer to level the gun compared to conventional turrets\n* Limited turret elevation makes engaging low-flying aircraft difficult.\n* Restocking the autoloader magazines is very slow.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

The M4 FL10 by the company Batignolles-Chatillon was such an attempt: born from the assembly of a FL10 turret (designed for the AMX-13) and the hull of a M4 Sherman (all variants of Sherman were used: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4 but the in-game variant is a M4A1).\n\nThe FL10 turret offered new combat capability to the Sherman with a crew of only 4 members and the autoloader. While the AMX hull had a low profile, the Sherman one stood very high, making it an obvious target. The M4 FL10 was produced in a small number: 24 units only.\n\nEgypt was the sole buyer of the tank in 1955 and fielded it during the Suez cris in 1956 and the Six-day-war in 1967. 12 tanks were captured by the IDF in 1956.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_m4a1_sherman_fl_10 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|DVvmY2wcnBY|'''Should You Buy: {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''ConeOfArc''|Uuqj-QGASRw|'''Should You Buy the {{PAGENAME}}?''' - ''Sako Sniper''|YL-p5XwBGpI|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|ih6xhSZlTgQ|'''The Shooting Range #78''' - ''War Machines'' section at 00:32 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other French hybrid vehicles\n* [[AMX-13-M24]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5162-development-m4a1-fl10-the-charming-sherman-en|[Devblog] M4A1 FL10 - The Charming Sherman]]\n\n{{France medium tanks}}\n{{France premium ground vehicles}}"}}
