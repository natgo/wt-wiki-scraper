Use the HEAT rounds to penetrate most armour of the M4A3 (105)'s rank and above, and remember that the M4A3 (105) is no brawler, so staying in the front line too close to hostiles will most likely spell a K.O. by ammo or crew. This tank gun has a very low velocity, so make sure to compensate for a large amount of drop\n\nHaving in mind the large calibre of this tank's main weapon, one can conclude that the HE shell (M1 shell) is big enough to dispatch some tanks. However, any armour larger than 28 mm won't let the explosion result in penetration. So for firing at strong armour plates, the HEAT shell (M67 shot) is required. It should be a top priority to research it. The HE shell will, however, be the most effective option whenever this Sherman's controller can find a suitably soft spot in the enemy vehicle's armour. Against soft vehicles, like most [[:Category:Anti-aircraft vehicles|SPAA]], the choice of ammunition for the main gun is fairly irrelevant, since a single shot should be enough to dispatch one of these, and remaining crew members can be taken down with one of the tank's [[M1919A4 (7.62 mm)|Browning]] machine guns, although HE is certainly the most effective at dishing out damage when armour is absent.\n\nThe HEAT round, unlike the HE one, has a tracer charge, which facilitates aiming. This is not critical, however, since the HE shell's sheer size allows for it to be seen without too much effort.\n\n;Combat tactics\n\nThe M4A3 (105) HVSS Sherman is a support tank, not a front-line brawler. Its adequate armour protection and a powerful gun put it on about the level of the [[M10 GMC|M10 Tank Destroyer]], but it has certain flaws and qualities that make it different than the usual Sherman tanks. Due to the 105 mm howitzer, knocking out the enemy crew in lightly armoured vehicles is a piece of cake. Aim for the enemy tank's lower turret to cause the most damage possible with the HE shells, as the HE shrapnel can be deflected down onto the hull roof and mess up the enemy crew. The 105 mm HE could also be aimed at the enemy tracks to blow it off, immobilizing the enemy. If none of the HE shells does damage to the target (which shouldn't happen most of the time), a well-placed HEAT shell, once unlocked, can easily set a tank aflame or blow up ammo stores. Don't get to close to enemy vehicles '''unless''' it is a limited traverse gun tank destroyer, in which case blow up its tracks with a HE that should do the trick.\n\nA downfall of the M4A3 (105) HVSS Sherman is its average mobility, slow turret traverse, and slow reload. Therefore, it is recommended to stick to allied tanks like glue or rely on hit-and-run tactics. The low velocity makes long-range shots relatively difficult. Never stay in the sights of tanks such as the [[KwK 40 (75 mm)|long-barrel 75 mm]] Panzer IV [[Pz.IV F2|F2]]/[[Pz.IV G|G]], StuG III [[StuG III F|F]]/[[StuG III G|G]] or [[T-34 (1942)|T-34]]/[[KV-1 (ZiS-5)|KV-1]]. These tanks can penetrate the M4A3 (105) HVSS Sherman's front armour, some more easily than others. Try not to get hit in the rear area as it will set the tank on fire and immobilize it, putting it in an extremely disadvantageous situation.\n\n;Enemies worth noting\n\n* [[LVT(A)(4) (ZiS-2) (China)|LVT(A)(4)(ZiS-2)]]: don't assume that you are indestructible in a downtier. If you see the giant boat-like chassis of a LVT but with a long cannon on top, be very careful. This LVT is able to penetrate your armor easily within 400m, or if you are not angling the hull. To block its incoming shells, either angle your hull, be at a hull-down position or be >500m away from it. While its shells can tear through your armor with ease, you can also effortlessly destroy it with your HEAT by causing a hull break. While you reload, don't forget to wiggle around in a patternless way to mess up its aim -- its gun traverse rather slowly, making it quite hard to keep up with moving targets.\n* [[ZiS-30]]: like the LVT(A)(4)(ZiS-2), this tank destroyer is armed with a similar 57 mm cannon capable of penetrating your front armour from any distance with ease. Apart from this, the ZiS-30 is also very narrow and small, making it very hard to get spotted especially when it is covered by bushes. This can become quite dangerous if the M4 commander does not scan the battlefield carefully enough. Luckily, comparing to the spacious LVT, the ZiS-30 is very compact and poorly protected. A spray of your roof-mounted 12.7 mm bullets will be enough to knock out its crew and components, let alone a hit from your 105 mm gun. Shells that land next to or behind the ZiS-30 can also damage it, since the side and rear of its fighting compartment has no protection at all, exposing its gunner and loader. \n\n;How to defeat a {{PAGENAME}}\n\nThe M4A3 (105) has certain flaws that can be exploited quite well. First of all, the howitzer armament means that the shell travels in a low-velocity, meaning the M4A3 (105) will be unlikely to engage at a long distance. Another is the fact that the M4A3 (105)'s gun has a long reload and a slow traverse speed, meaning it is also not very good in a close-range encounter. Despite these flaws, the M4A3 (105) is a formidable foe with its armament. The HE and HEAT shell the 105 mm can dish out has a real possibility to knock out friendly crew and teammates, if not absolutely destroying light tanks. These high-explosives can also break tracks easily, causing the player tank to be immobilized and exposed not only to the M4A3 (105), but to the other enemies as well, and the M4A3 (105) will most likely not be alone.\n\nTo engage the M4A3 (105), try not to engage its frontal armour if in a tank with BR lower than 3.7. Its frontal armour, despite what most will say about the Sherman's armour, is quite formidable and can deflect most incoming enemy round from light and medium tanks. This is why it is recommended to bring high-velocity guns like the [[M7 (76 mm)]] on the [[M10 GMC]] or the [[KwK40 (75 mm)]] on the later Panzer IV. If it can't be engaged from the front, manoeuvre to its side and rear armour, as these armour plate are extremely vulnerable to even 37 mm guns. When manoeuvring around the M4A3 (105), try not expose the tank for a prolonged time and move faster than the M4A3 (105)'s slow turret traverse rate (though beware that the M4A3 can compensate this slow turn by turning the entire body). If fast enough, a tank could also move past the 105 mm low-velocity shell and mess up the enemy's lead. This will eventually lead to a good shot on the M4A3's weak points. Another simpler and less mobile way is to lie in wait in a tank destroyer such as the StuG III for the M4A3 to move tight into the TD's line of fire, giving a clean shot to a vulnerable armour part. A good shot on a general part of the hull can ignite one of the many ammo racks strewn around the interior.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Their role was to support the other armoured units by destroying fortifications and obstacles. The M4A3 (105) was not provided officially to the Free French Forces through the lend-lease program. However, as they were embedded under US command in preparation of the invasion of France, a few French armoured divisions received the tank from US Army stocks.\nThe French 2nd Armoured Division received several M4A3 (105) under those circumstances in the UK in 1944. The 1ère and 5ème Divisions Blindées (1st and 5th Armored Divisions) were first equipped with M4A3(105) Shermans in April 1945. 18 M4A3(105) Shermans had been listed as authorized in January 1945, but they were not listed as on hand until April 29 - May 5. From images it can be seen that many of those tanks were M4(105)s, but at least one was an M4A3(105). \n\nThey saw combat action in France in 1944 and in Western Germany in early 1945.\n \nAfter the war, many M4A3 (105) were supplied by the US to European countries as part of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. France received 230 units they allocated to their cavalry units garrisoned in the French occupation zone in Germany. These M4A3 (105) never saw combat.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_m4a3_105_sherman Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|u0WSReeB_s8|'''The {{PAGENAME}} Medium Tank''' - ''Orangefan''|_xCgMBOiA8U|'''High-explosive power''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:24 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[M4A3 (105)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[StuH 42 G]]\n* [[105/25 M43]]\n* [[Sav m/43 (1946)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:M4_Sherman|[Wikipedia] M4 Sherman]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/US/M4_Sherman <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Medium Tank M4 Sherman]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{France medium tanks}}"}}
