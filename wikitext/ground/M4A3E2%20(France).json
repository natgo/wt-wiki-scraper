Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. This is a Jumbo provided to the Free French Forces by Americans.\n\nThe M4A3E2 looks like a standard Sherman medium tank, but it is still a weighty tank and is used as a breakthrough tank to attack fortified enemy positions. It is certainly not a medium tank like normal Shermans. It is a great tank when fighting Tigers as the 88mm cannons cannot penetrate the armour of the M4A3E2 from its sides when angled efficiently. As such, it allows players to get close to Tigers and attack them from the sides, or force them to retreat. When fighting Panthers, the M4A3E2 is less effective as the 75mm cannon on the Panther can penetrate the armour of the Jumbo Sherman from the front even when angled more than 30 degrees at 500 meters. Only at close range can high-velocity guns, such as Soviet 85 mm or German 88 mm guns, penetrate the frontal glacis. However, larger calibres such as the Soviet 122 mm gun will slice right through the armour.\n\nIt takes on the general look of an [[M4A2]] but is much more armoured (and uses a Ford gasoline engine). The M4A3E2 features the double-layered front armour giving the vehicle its distinctive 101.6 mm total front armour. It provides its boast of being better armoured than the [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]]. The transmission housing is considerably beefier, too, from the addition of armour at the area as well. The front of the T23-style turret is distinctive with the very blocky gun mantlet and circular barrel shroud around the rather underwhelming 75 mm gun barrel.\n\nThe sides and suspension look like the usual game with the M4 Sherman series, but with minor differences. The flat side armour of the hull, instead of 38.1 mm thick, is now 76.2 mm thick for much more reliable side protection. However, the lower side hull around the bogie suspension area is still only 38.1 mm thick, vulnerable to most conventional anti-tank weapons. Another minor difference is the tracks. The T48 rubber chevron tracks are equipped with extended end connectors to improve ground pressure performance for the additional weight of the armour.\n\nHowever, the rear does not have any extra armour and is much thinner. The roof of the tank is thinly armoured as well, only having 19.5 mm on the hull and 25.4 mm on the turret, so beware as artillery barrages tend to set engine compartment modules on fire.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members.

It is best to try and force the Jumbo to try and angle his vehicle towards the player or his allies. An angle more than 30 degrees can expose the much weaker lower side hull armour in the suspension that is only 38.1 mm thick. With a powerful enough gun, a round can penetrate this area and damage the crew, or even set off the ammunition all cluttered up on the bottom of the tank.\n\nIf a frontal engagement is unavoidable and are unfortunately armed with guns unable to penetrate through the front glacis, there are only two areas that are viable. First is the machine gun port, which is one of the areas that is not layered with the extra 38.1 mm added on top of the base armour. Guns like the Panzer IV 75 mm KwK 40 guns that are unable to cleave through the front glacis can push their luck in this area, with small \"sweet spots\" that the round can pass through. Another way to attack the M4A3E2 in this scenario is exploiting a shot-trap in the gun mantlet. The small corner flaps on the bottom corners of the gun mantlet have a tendency to deflect rounds downwards onto the 19.5 mm hull roof armour. While this will be left to the ricochet chances, it is still possible and can be used if no other scenarios are favourable.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

These two will also unlock Tier II modifications and grant access to the very vital ''FPE'' and ''M61 shot'', the former for preservation against fires and the latter to improve damage in the battlefield.\n\nThen in Tier III, ''Crew Replenishment'' should be obtained for crew survival improvement and the APCR ''T45 shot'' for improved armour-piercing power. After that, everything else could be done at one's own priorities, but ''Engine'' should be invested for better automotive performances and ''M89'' for the smoke capabilities.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe M4A3E2 is best in assaulting enemy positions with allies. Its great mobility for a heavy tank, especially with its armour, makes it a vehicle able to charge into battle and take anything head-on with confidence. It can act as a bullet magnet against enemy tanks more worried about the M4A3E2, diverting fire that would've gone to more vulnerable teammates. Though the 75mm gun's AP performance is not suited to the type of enemies expected at the BR, it can still harass enemies and the gun is lethal enough that enemies will be forced to show their front armour towards the Jumbo else a 75 mm penetrates their side armour. Their focus on the Jumbo can allow allies to move around and eliminate them. During all this, take care not to overangle and show the lower side armour too much as this will allow vehicles to penetrate through down there and damage modules, even the ammunition storage if they are lucky.\n\nAnother role the M4A3E2 is good in is as a flanker. Due to its great mobility as a heavy tank, the M4A3E2 Jumbo can manoeuvre like a medium tank around the battlefield. This is also beneficial to the 75 mm gun as it would permit the M4A3E2 a chance to attack the weaker side armours of enemy vehicles. Once flanking around and finding a prime position in a fire angle right into an enemy chokepoint, minimize exposure to anything but the front armour and the M4A3E2 can remain a formidable obstacle to all opponents. Take care not to be outflanked by enemy players aware of the M4A3E2 position.\n\nDue to the M4A3E2 Jumbo having a slightly higher battle-rating than the other M4 Shermans at 4.7, it can be up-tiered against tanks such as the [[Panther D]] and [[Tiger_H1|Tiger H1]], meaning its 75 mm cannon starts becoming less effective. For this reason, it is advisable to take the T45 APCR ammo into battle once unlocked, at least enough to take on the armoured targets the Jumbo will face.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\nThe Soviet 85 mm can be a threat, so caution is advised when going up against tanks armed with the 85 mm, such as the [[T-34-85]], [[SU-85]], and [[IS-1]]. The [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)|Jagdpanzer 38(t)]] and [[Jagdpanzer IV]] can be tricky when facing off against them. Their frontal armour are too thick and sloped for the 75 mm M3 gun to have any effect on it. For these two targets, it is advised to target their tracks and transmission and then flank for a side shot, where the armour is much weaker. Also, the [[Dicker Max]] wields a 105 mm that can penetrate the front plate of the M4A3E2 Jumbo, so caution is advised against those as well. Finally, there is one common opponent from the Soviet/Chinese tree: IS-2. Its 122 mm gun can easily penetrate the Jumbo, regardless of angle and distance. To destroy it, shoot at it when it's reloading or is unaware of your presence. For the 1943 model, aim at the cupola or the curved part of its hull armour that blends into the side. It has only 4 crew so killing all the turret crew (3, which is easy) will destroy it. For the 1944 model, only aim at the turret or the cupola as its hull is very strong.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

However, there is one known M4A3E2 that was issued to the French 1st Armoured Division (''Division Blindée (DB)''), an unusual case as most of the M4A3E2 inventory was headed to the Twelfth United States Army Group, whereas the French 1st DB was with the US Sixth Army Group. Information is not well known about this sole M4A3E2, but it served in the headquarter platoon of the 2nd Squadron of the 2nd African Chasseur Regiment (''2e régiment de chasseurs d'Afrique''). On 16 April 1945, lieutenant Amédée de Falgayrac, commander of the 1st platoon in the 2nd Squadron, was killed by shrapnel at Ortenberg, Germany. The M4A3E2 was then renamed ''Lt Falgayrac'' a few days later in honour.\n\nThe French did obtain a number of M4A3E2 surplus for use in the post-war period.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=france&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=heavy_tank&vehicle=fr_m4a3e2_sherman_jumbo Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|l31USzTa5EQ|'''How to destroy the Jumbo''' - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|XDLsvMpjSF4|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other M4A3E2 vehicles in the game\n* [[M4A3E2]]\n* [[Cobra King]]\n* [[M4A3E2 (76) W]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:M4_Sherman#M4A3E2|[Wikipedia] M4 Sherman - M4A3E2]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/US/m4a3e2-jumbo-assault-tank <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Assault Tank M4A3E2 Jumbo]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{France heavy tanks}}"}}
