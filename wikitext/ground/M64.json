In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Winged Lions\"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season VI, \"Firepower\"]].\n\nAn attempt by the ROCA to build a new tank from spare [[M18 (China)|M18]] turrets and [[M42 (China)|M42 Duster]] hulls in the mid-1970s, the M64 served as a \"domestic\" alternative to their fleets of US tanks. Despite being heavier than the M18, the more powerful power plant allows the M64 to retain similar mobility.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe very first thing players will notice is the chassis — instead of the original Buick M18 GMC chassis, it has an M42 Duster one, a variant of [[M41A1|M41 Walker Bulldog]]. While the overall design is small, this also means that any part of this tank other than the mantlet would be an easy target for vehicles with firepower heavier than .50 cal HMGs, let alone autocannon-calibre rounds with even more penetration; so the M64 should never, ever be used for direct engagements. \n\nThe larger, yet thinner, chassis might sometimes deflect larger calibre rounds, but do not rely on it, as HMG rounds will still penetrate more often than not.\n\nThe lower front plate is 25.4 mm thick, twice as thick as that of the M18. The advantage is that this thicker plate is now able to block more damage (to a limited extent) from nearby HE and bomb explosions, thus better protecting the driver and the machine gunner. It is also more effective against large-calibre MG bullets and non-HVAP autocannon shells. The downside however is that this thickness is above the fuse sensitivity of many shells (19 mm) allowing the shells to properly detonate once penetrated, as opposed to over-penetrating on the M18 (12.7 mm). This is bad news when facing tanks that primarily use high-explosive shells.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Thanks to the introduction of the original M42 chassis in 1952, this gives the M64 an overall higher power output at 500 hp while retaining the ability to neutral steer, making it more nimble in an urban environment than the original M18 albeit with a heavier weight.\n\nThe increased weight does slow the tank down. The M64's acceleration is noticeably slower than that of the M18 especially when driving off-road. As a result, it takes much longer to reach top speed. The reverse speed is also slower, at -19 km/h. However, this is still a relatively rapid speed compared to most other vehicles at its tier. \n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

This round can be ignored as it is only a downgrade over the stock shell. \n* '''M93, APCR:''' The M93 shot, while having much more penetration than all the previous rounds used on M64, is still an APCR round and thus has poor post-penetration damage, as well as bad performance against sloped armour plates; but it is still suggested to bring a few APCR in case of heavier vehicles with some flat surfaces the M64 could meet when up-tiered, such as the Tiger II (H).\n\n* '''M88, Smoke:''' If you need to harass distant enemies or cover yourself or your teammates, the M64 still comes with M88 smoke shells at your disposal.\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.13.0.133''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThanks to the fusing of M18's turret onto an M42 Duster's chassis, the M64 retains the same firepower of an M18 while having the mobility of an M41. While it has higher horsepower than an M18 and comes with neutral steering capabilities, it is also 50% heavier than M18 so it might have slightly slower speed, but in most cases this is enough for flanking enemies or rushing for vantage points. Another thing that is worth mentioning is that the change of chassis also reduced the wobbling effect on the gun when coming to a full stop, allowing for quicker aim and accurate shooting after stopping from top speed.\n\nThe change of chassis also comes at a cost, however — its protection. The M42 chassis has only 12.7 mm of armour all-around, which only stops rifle calibre bullets at most. Anything larger can tear it apart with ease; only the mantle and turret front could stop HMG fire. \n\nTo utilize the M64 to its greatest extent, use your speed and flank enemies that are fixated on your allies. This is the most viable way to play, as its low armor means it won't survive a direct engagement. The reload rate and the performance of its stock M62 shells can do short work against most enemies it might face, while HVAP doesn't have the best performance, it can still be of use in case the M64 encounters tanks with flat surfaces, giving the ability to fight back in dire moments.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

M42 Dusters were purchased later in 1958 as military aid from the United States. \n\nWhile the M18 GMC proved its capability in WWII's European Theater, in the late 1960s, the ageing chassis and lack of spare parts for the Wright 975 C4 radial engine became a major problem for logistics; the M42 on the other hand was not efficient against supersonic jets. Thus the idea of fusing a turret from M18 with spare M42 chassis came into the mind of the '''Combined Service Forces (聯合勤務總司令部；aka 聯勤)'''. In ROC Year 64 (1975), they assembled one such tank and dubbed it the '''Type 64 Light Tank ([國造]六四式輕戰車)''' which was later approved by the Commander of the ROCA for serial modifications. Some 42 M64s were assembled over the next 3 years, first seen deployed in northern Taiwan at Hsinchu and then redeployed at Penghu for defence.\n\nAs the tensions of the Taiwan Strait Crisis passed, these M64s were soon decommissioned in 1981; the only two known examples of M64 are now displayed at Armor Training Command (陸軍裝甲兵訓練指揮部) at Hukou, Hsinchu and Camp Chenggongling (成功嶺營區) at Wu'ri, Taichung City.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/7521-development-battle-pass-vehicles-m64-en|Devblog]] ===\nIn the early 1950s, armed forces on Taiwan obtained a large number of armored fighting vehicles from the U.S. and South Korea, mainly consisting of M18 Hellcat and M24 Chaffee tanks as well as a few dozen Shermans. In October 1958, they also managed to obtain a number of American M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks. However, despite more advanced vehicles becoming available, the military retained even the older vehicles in active service, leading to some vehicles even exceeding the service life of their original design. By 1969 however, the military decommissioned and scrapped several dozen M18 Hellcats. This in turn, created a gap in the fighting strength and a stopgap solution had to be formulated.\n\nThe solution came in the form of the M64 light tank, developed in 1975. It was conceived on the basis of the M42 Duster chassis which were obtained alongside the M41 Walker Bulldogs in the late 1950s. Engineers then combined the chassis with the turret of the previously decommissioned M18 Hellcats to form a new highly mobile light tank, designated the M64. Entering service in 1975, around 53 M64 light tanks were built. These vehicles didn’t see any combat use and were retired from active service in 1981.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=cn_type_64 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|WlS7yspnciI|'''Battle Pass: Firepower''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 02:14 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7521-development-battle-pass-vehicles-m64-en|[Devblog] Battle Pass vehicles: M64]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Research Development Center}}\n{{China light tanks}}\n{{China premium ground vehicles}}"}}
