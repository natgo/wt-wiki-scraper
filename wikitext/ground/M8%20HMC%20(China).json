If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nIn general, the M8 Scott plays like a beefed-up [[M5A1 (China)|M5A1]]. Being based on the same chassis, the massive increase in gun calibre and destructive potential means that enemies the light tank previously had difficulty destroying can now be dealt with more easily. One strategy is to push for the capture point and take it immediately using the high speed the chassis is capable of reaching. Once the capture point is held, find a good hull-down position and use the 75 mm HEAT to destroy any and all oncoming tanks.\n\nWhen attacking open-topped vehicles like SPAAs, tank destroyers and trucks, the 75 mm HEAT round can demolish a vehicle in one hit. If the 75 mm is reloading or is unoperational, the .50 cal M2HB machine gun can be used to great effect against the target. This machine gun can even be used from behind cover, with the entire vehicle hidden behind an object and the machine gun poking up and over it. \n\nAgainst heavier armour, the need to find a good hidden position is critical. On certain tanks, the addition of track armour can give the M8 difficulty in penetrating them. A good hull down position on their flank can provide a shot to hit their side armour, which is generally less armoured. Keep in mind that some tanks like the [[Pz.III M]], [[Pz.III N (Italy)|Pz.III N]], and the 41M Turan II are equipped with sideskirts and spaced armour. These are designed to counter HEAT rounds and often can absorb at least one HEAT round with no damage to the components behind it.\n\nTanks like the [[Pz.IV F2]] and its line of tanks can be a serious headache for the M8 Scott. A recommended strategy is to aim for the right side of their turret and knock-out their gunner first, then aim for the middle of their hull (upper or lower glacis works) for a final shot. Outside of that, most of the heavy armour will be out of the M8's BR range leaving most encountered vehicles viable to destroy.\n\nIf you finds itself under attack from the air, find cover as the M8 Scott's roof is open to any and all strafing fire. Once sufficient cover is found, you can switch to the cupola-mounted M2HB and attempt to shoot down the attackers. The .50 cal machine gun can output a decent amount of damage against critical components on an aircraft, and can pilot snipe an enemy due to its high penetration.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Great firepower, HEAT has enough power to penetrate tough adversaries like the [[B1 bis]] and [[Matilda III]]\n* 12.7 mm M2HB heavy machine gun is lethal at the battle rating and can quickly destroy vehicles like the [[Ha-Go]] or the [[He 51 C-1]]\n* Excellent gun depression of -20 degrees, able to peek above almost every slope and launch surprise attacks\n* When hull-down, its double layer turret front can bounce some low-calibre or low-penetrating shells like the [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]]s' 20 mm\n* Very fast reload for the calibre allows quick follow up shots\n* Low muzzle velocity shell's parabolic path can allow for shooting over hills which can be surprisingly useful\n* Speed and mobility of the [[M5 Stuart (Family)|M5 Stuart]] light tanks, allowing it to manoeuvre and flank with ease\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Extremely slow turret traverse makes CQB challenging, especially if the vehicle is immobilized\n* Short gun can be difficult to use in long range engagements\n* Open-top turret exposes crew to artillery and aircraft strafing fire\n* Thin armour and tightly packed crew makes it very vulnerable to tank destroyers that have APHE, like the [[SU-76M]]\n* Shells have low muzzle velocity, making shooting at long-range or moving targets difficult\n* Tightly packed crew which can be knocked out easily\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Approximately 200 M8 arrived in Taiwan alongside batches of M7 ''Priest'' self-propelled guns and [[M4 Sherman (Family)|M4 Sherman]] medium tanks.\n\nIn 1948, the Chinese Civil War battles were still ongoing. Numerous battles were won by the Communist Party of China's armoured forces and they started to show rising superiority in tank and troop numbers. This superiority lead to their eventual total control of mainland China and the retreat of the Kuomintang to Taiwan.\n\nThe M8s were designated to provide close artillery support in case of massive Communist amphibious assaults in Taiwan and adjacent islands. This large-scale invasion never occurred and it is uncertain if the M8 Scotts took any part in combat on the Chinese Civil War aside from training exercises.\n\nThere are several preserved M8s currently in display in Taiwan.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=cn_m8_scott Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|4_cJ1CpEatw|'''Best gun depression''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:43 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n'''US similar versions'''\n\n* [[M8 Scott]]\n* [[M8A1]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* ''\"Tanke Mao,\" Ching-shih Ch'iang-chia, and T'ien Li-jen:'' ''\"The Evolution of the Republic of China Army Armored Artillery.''\" ''Illustrated Guide of Weapons & Tactics'' [兵器戰術圖解], v20 May 2005, p78-82.\n* ''The Developmental History of the Nationalist Armored Force'' [國軍裝甲兵發展史] by Said Mohamed 孫建中; Sun Chien-chung, 2005\n\n* [https://ttt0920.pixnet.net/blog/post/99710457 ROC's M8 pictures]\n* [https://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=186119 English forum discussion related to the ROC's M8 combat use]\n* [https://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=199720 English forum discussion related to the arrival of the M8 to Taiwan]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{China tank destroyers}}"}}
