In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Chinese light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]]. It is identical to the American [[M8 Greyhound]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThis vehicle's intended design leaves us with only 12.7 mm of armour at a 59° angle slope at the front hull, Side hull is only protected with 9.5 mm. And the strongest part being the gun mantlet with 25 mm added to 19.1 mm of turret armour. As a result this vehicle is only protected against rifle-calibre MG fire, with the sides easily penetrated by heavy MG fire. Although this may prove an advantage when fighting against shells with delayed fuse. The crew is very tight, so one AP shell at the center could knock out everyone inside, but notice that there is a huge gap between the driving compartment and the fighting compartment, meaning it will absorb plenty of shells and saving the player from being destroyed quickly. There are some rounds stored at the turret, and at the vehicle's floor, bringing less rounds eliminates the rounds stored in the turret. Also keep in mind that it is an open top vehicle, making it vulnerable to artillery and aerial attacks.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (turret, gun mantlet)\n* Structural steel (mudguard, storage boxes, gun breech)\n* Wheels (tires)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is a small calibre fast-firing gun with a maximum penetration of 84 mm at 100 m (M51B1/B2 shell), being able to penetrate almost all the opponents it will ever face. While it lacks the post-penetration damage to one-shot most enemy, it can quickly finish them off with its fast reload. The penetration and trajectory drops a lot beyond 500 m. Note that the gun has a vertical stabiliser, giving the player a huge advantage in some cases, but keep in mind that the stabiliser only works when the tank is slower than 10 km/h.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| M74B1 || AP || 79 || 76 || 65 || 54 || 45 || 37\n|-\n| M51B1/B2 || APCBC || 87 || 84 || 73 || 60 || 50 || 41\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| M74B1 || AP || 883 || 0.87 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| M51B1/B2 || APCBC || 883 || 0.87 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks M8 LAC.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated:''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The roof-mounted .50 cal can traverse 360 degrees and has great depression & elevation, posting a big threat to any plane that is flying too close to the M8. It has an unbelievable penetration of 31 mm at 10 m, meaning it can easily penetrate plenty of lightly armoured vehicles and even the side of some medium tanks. The 7.62 mm MG, on the other hand, can only efficiently damage exposed crews due to its low penetration.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nWhen using this vehicle keep in mind that you are virtually naked to every main gun, that means you should not expose yourself unnecessarily and not give the opponents a chance to shoot at you, coupled with the fact that the main gun can penetrate every other vehicle in its rank. Its excellent mobility gives this vehicle a very viable hit-and-run tactic. Ambush your opponent on your terms. After you destroy him, change your position again, find concealment or cover, use your fast reverse speed to your advantage, avoid one on one fights, and fair fights.\n\nAt the start of the match, the M8 is best used for a point-capping vehicle. Find a road connecting to a point to unleash its scary 90 km/h on-road top speed, and it is likely to get to the point before the enemy can. Once the point is capped, quickly move away as there are likely to be artillery strikes, which can critically damage the M8.\n\nAfter capping a point, there are two good options (just examples, the player is free to play in their way). One is to hide at the side of the point, waiting for the enemy to re-cap it. Use its small profile to set up a good ambush, and flank the enemy unexpectedly. The fast-firing gun will genuinely shine when attacking several enemies from the side or rear, allowing the player to knock out a surprising amount of enemies. Once the enemies are wiped out, quickly re-cap the point and ambush again. Note that the player might want to change their position as some enemies might try and revenge.\n\nAnother playstyle is the hit-and-run tactic, thanks to its great mobility and small profile. If careful enough, it can travel between points like a ghost without being noticed and flank the enemies. The stabilizer will help a lot as it gives the player the ability to fire first. If the first shell missed or didn't penetrate, it can even finish off the enemy with the .50 cal HMG alone.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting''':\n\n[[LVT (Family)|LVT]] series:\n\nThese amphibious tanks are well known for their huge hull size. Indeed, there is a huge space between the driving compartment and the fighting compartment that will absorb almost any incoming shells, and unfortunately, the M8's solid AP can't cope with this. If an M8 doesn't know where are the crew is located on an LVT, they will die due to not being able to knock out the crew effectively. Remember their crew location, and the M8 can easily take them out.\n\nThe driver is at the foremost part of the hull. Behind him, there is absolutely nothing, so you must avoid shooting there. Behind the empty space, the turret houses 2-3 crew members. Shoot there to disable its gun. And don't forget, at the very rear of the LVT, the two exposed machine gunners can be taken out with the .50 cal. Memorize those three main locations of the crew, and you can effectively destroy any LVT out there with your rapid reload. Also, if the angle isn't too large, the .50 can penetrate the LVT's weak armour.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* The M51 shell has 84 mm penetration at 100 m, enough to penetrate common opponents like the [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]], [[Pz.III B]] or [[Ha-Go (Family)|Ha-Go]], and the fast reload helps to precisely knock out the crew one by one\n* The pintle-mounted heavy machine gun is very lethal against other similarly armoured vehicles (eg. [[AS 42]], [[L3/33 CC|L3/33]]) and slow biplanes\n* One of the fastest vehicles on road with a max speed of 90 km/h allows it to get to positions quickly\n* Reverse speed of 12 km/h allows it to retreat from danger quickly\n* Small profile makes ambushing/hiding easy\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Wheeled vehicle, performs poorly off-road and cannot turn in place, and especially slow in desert maps like [[Sinai]] and snowy maps like [[Frozen Pass (Ground Forces)|Frozen Pass]]\n* Virtually no armour, tight crew and open top make this vehicle very vulnerable to rapid-firing tanks like the [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]], [[M13 MGMC|M13]] or strafing planes\n* M6 cannon requires precision shots, as post penetration effects are weak especially against the [[LVT(A)(1)|LVT(A)]] series which are super spacious\n* Turret traverse is rather sluggish, might not get the gun on target sometimes\n* Looks very similar to the American [[M8 Greyhound]], the lighter coloured camouflage can be hard to distinguish in [[Simulator Battles]]\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

After WW2, the US Foreign Military Assistance Program donated surplus cars to the United States Constabulary in various Western European and Asian nations. French Forces noted usage of this car, and during the Korean and Vietnam War, both Viet Cong and Chinese got their hands on it as well, but the Korean Army was the primary user, who then donated them to the Vietnamese. Belgium also used these cars as part of NATO, and in UN forces sent to peacekeep in the Congo. M8s are still in service in Columbia, Guatemala, Peru, and Paraguay.\n\n'''Chinese usage'''\n\nThe M8 greyhounds were supplied to National China (which was only Taiwan at this stage) by the US around 1950, roughly around the same time they were supplied with other tanks such as the M24 and M41. These tanks were exported to Taiwan in much greater quantities than the M8 LAC, therefore it saw little use in combat.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=cn_m8_greyhound Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|RGeu2yLGeTU|'''Best armored cars''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 0:32 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|GCP_b025iYo|'''M8 LAC, Taiwanese , Tier-1, Armored Car / Light Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[M8 Greyhound (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://ww2db.com/vehicle_spec.php?q=410 <nowiki>[World War II Database]</nowiki> M8 Greyhound] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210515155845/https://ww2db.com/vehicle_spec.php?q=410 Web Archive])\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ford}}\n{{China light tanks}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
